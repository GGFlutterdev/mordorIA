# Introduction

Welcome to *Tales from the Yawning Portal*. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.

Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword CoastÃ¢ÂÂand even some visiting from other D&D worldsÃ¢ÂÂspin tales and rumors of lost treasures.

- A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.
- A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.
- A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.

These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of FaerÃÂ»n and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.

The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.

## Using This Book

Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.

The introduction of each adventure provides ideas on adapting it to a variety of D&D settings. Use that information to place it in your campaign or to give you an idea of how to adapt it.

These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as *Storm King's Thunder*, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.

### About the Adventures

#### The Sunless Citadel

*The Sunless Citadel*, written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.

Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.

#### The Forge of Fury

*The Forge of Fury*, written by Richard Baker, was published in 2000 shortly after The Sunless Citadel. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.

Like its predecessor, *The Forge of Fury* is tailored to provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters make their way through the fortress. Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th levelÃ¢ÂÂseasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.

#### The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan

*The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan*, written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title *Lost Tamoachan* at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.

The updated version of the adventure presented herein is designed for a group of four or five 5th-level player characters.

#### White Plume Mountain

Lawrence Schick, the author of *White Plume Mountain*, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but *White Plume* became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.

The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.

#### Dead in Thay

*Dead in Thay*, written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to *Tomb of Horrors*, *Ruins of Undermountain*, and other "killer dungeons" throughout the history of the game.

The version of *Dead in Thay* presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.

#### Against the Giants

The three linked adventures that make up *Against the Giants* were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the *Player's Handbook* for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.

The compilation of *Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl*, and *Hall of the Fire Giant King* was published in 1981 as *Against the Giants*. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.

#### Tomb of Horrors

Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the *Tomb of Horrors*.

The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of *Tomb of Horrors*, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.

As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.

### Running the Adventures

To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition *Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.

>>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>>

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in *appendix B*. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in *appendix A*.

### Creating a Campaign

While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaignÃ¢ÂÂover 30 years separates the newest from the oldestÃ¢ÂÂthey have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.

Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.

The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.

## The Yawning Portal

Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.

In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.

For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.

All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.

Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.

Adventurers from across FaerÃÂ»n, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.

> ##### The Green Dragon Inn
>
>The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.

### Features of the Yawning Portal

The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The "well" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.

Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.

***Entering the Well.*** Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to "ride the rope") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.

***Oddities on Display.*** A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.

### A Typical Evening

On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.

Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.

### Starting the Story

Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern). This approach is a clichÃÂ©, but it is an effective one. Use the following two tables to generate a couple of details, then tailor the particulars of the quest and the quest giver to suit the adventure you plan to run.

##### A Mysterious Stranger Offers a Quest
|  d8 | Objective                                     |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Recover a particular item                     |
|  2  | Find and return with an NPC or monster        |
|  3  | Slay a terrible monster or NPC                |
|  4  | Guard a person while they perform a ritual    |
|  5  | Create an accurate map of part of the dungeon |
|  6  | Discover secret lore hidden in the dungeon    |
|  7  | Destroy an object                             |
|  8  | Sanctify part of the dungeon to a god of good |

##### The Mysterious Stranger's Secret
|  d8 | Secret                                     |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Intends to betray the party                |
|  2  | Unwittingly provides false information     |
|  3  | Has a secret agenda (roll another quest)   |
|  4  | Is a devil in disguise                     |
|  5  | Has led other parties to their doom        |
|  6  | Is the charmed thrall of a **mind flayer** |
|  7  | Is possessed by a **ghost**                |
|  8  | Is a **solar** in disguise                 |

### Durnan

The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is something of an enigma. Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by treasures he brought back from his expedition nearly two centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the tap room as the well.

Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in return for hard cash. "We know the odds and take our chances," he says, whether he is breaking up a card game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of adventurers trapped at the bottom of the well who are unable to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.

***Personality Trait: Isolation.*** It's a cruel world. All people have to fend for themselves. Self-sufficiency is the only path to success.

***Ideal: Independence.*** Someone who can stand alone can stand against anything.

***Bond: The Yawning Portal.*** This place is my only home. My friends and family are long gone. I love this place, but I try not to get attached to the people here. I'll outlive them all. Lucky me.

***Flaw: Heartless.*** If you want sympathy, the Temple of **Ilmater** is in the Sea Ward. No matter how bad things are, you'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

### Other Denizens

The Yawning Portal is host to a variety of regular visitors, most of whom offer services to adventurers. *Chapter 4* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* provides plenty of resources for generating nonplayer characters. The following table provides some possibilities for why an individual is visiting the Yawning Portal.

##### Denizens of the Yawning Portal

|  9  | Magically preserved corpse in a coffin leaning against the bar; if asked about it, Durnan says, "He's waiting for someone," and nothing more       |
|  10 | Elminster, incognito; 10 percent chance he is on an errand of cosmic importance; otherwise, he's pressing Durnan for gossip                        |

# Tomb of Horrors

In the far reaches of the world, under a lost and lonely hill, lies the sinister Tomb of Horrors. This labyrinthine crypt is filled with terrible traps, strange and ferocious monsters, rich and magical treasures, and somewhere within rests the demilich.

The legend of the tomb is an old story with many parts, some of which may be lost or obscured. Characters attempting to glean special information by consulting sages or through *legend lore* spells may still have difficulty obtaining as much background as they desire, for the scraps of information thus gained are often minimal and mystical.

The essentials of the legend can be furnished to the players from the following section.

## Legend of the Tomb

Somewhere under a lost and lonely hill of grim and foreboding aspect lies a labyrinthine crypt. It is filled with terrible traps and not a few strange and ferocious monsters to slay the unwary. It is filled with rich treasures both precious and magical, but in addition to the aforementioned guardians, there is said to be a demilich who still wards his final haunt. Be warned that tales have it that this being, called Acererak, possesses powers that make him nearly undefeatable!

All accounts conclude that it is quite unlikely any explorers will ever find the chamber where the demilich lingers, for the passages and rooms of the tomb are fraught with traps, poison gases, and magical protections. Furthermore, the demilich has so well hidden his lair that even those who avoid the pitfalls will not be likely to locate their true goal. Only large and well-prepared parties of the bravest and strongest should even consider the attempt, and if such a group does locate the tomb, they must be prepared to fail. Any expedition must have magical protections and weapons, and must be equipped with every sort of device possible to ensure survival.

> ##### About the Original
>
>![](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/000-totyp-07-book.webp)
>
>*Tomb of Horrors* was born in Gary Gygax's home campaign and introduced to the world at the first Origins game convention in 1975. Since its original publication in 1978, *Tomb of Horrors* has risen to legendary status among D&D players and is generally regarded as one of the greatest adventures of all time.
>
>In the words of its creator, "This is a thinking person's adventure." It was designed not for player characters of a certain levelÃ¢ÂÂthough high-level adventurers are certainly necessaryÃ¢ÂÂbut for players who enjoy a mental challenge and DMs who want to put their own spin on this truly unique dungeon.
>

### The Truth behind the Legend

Ages ago, a human wizard/cleric of surpassing evil took the steps necessary to preserve his life force beyond the centuries he had already lived, and this creature became the lich known as Acererak. Over the scores of years which followed, the lich dwelled with hordes of ghastly servants in the gloomy stone halls of the very hill where the tomb is.

Eventually even the undead life force of Acererak began to wane, so for the next eight decades, the lich's servants labored to create the Tomb of Horrors. Then Acererak destroyed all his slaves and servitors, magically hid the entrance to his halls, and went to reside in his final haunt, while his soul roamed strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. If the characters gain access to the innermost part of the tomb where the lich's crypt lies, their actions along the way will have caused his soul to be called back to the Material Plane and alerted Acererak, now a **demilich**, that interlopers have invaded his resting place.

> ##### Placing the Adventure
>
>In the original *Tomb of Horrors*, Gary Gygax suggested six possible, far-flung locations for the adventure in the Greyhawk settingÃ¢ÂÂproof in itself that the tomb is liable to turn up just about anywhere. Those possibilities are as follows:
>
>- Inside the highest hill on the Plains of Iuz
>- On an island (unmapped) in the Nyr Dyv
>- In the Bright Desert
>- At the western border of the Duchy of Geoff
>- Somewhere in the Vast Swamp south of Sunndi
>- On an island beyond the realm of the Sea Barons

>Other settings offer choices that are just as varied.
>
>***Dragonlance.*** The tomb on Krynn might be in the foothills near the Eastwall Mountains, in the Cursed Lands of Newsea, or in the Shadowglades of Krynn, where a renegade wizard who served Takhisis was said to dwell.

>***Eberron.*** Appropriate sites for the tomb in Eberron include the Ashen Spires of Karrnath, or among the tors in the Vile Marsh between Droaam and the Shadow Marches. among Shargon's Teeth. Eberron's Boneyard could hide the tomb and thus speak to Acererak's enmity for Eberron's dragons.

>***Forgotten Realms.*** The tomb could be in the Serpent Hills or the Trielta Hills on FaerÃÂ»n. It could be in the High Moor or amid the isles that make up the Korinn Archipelago in the Moonshaes. It might be somewhere in the Anauroch desert, perhaps tying Acererak to ancient Netheril.

## Running the Adventure

As clever players will gather from the information in the "*Legend of the Tomb*," this dungeon has more tricks and traps than it has monsters to fight. This is a thinking person's adventure, and if your group is a hack-and-slay gathering, they will be unhappy! Only high-level characters stand a chance of surviving, but every player who braves the tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.

Negotiation of the tomb will require quite a long time, so be prepared to spend several sessions with this material. When the game ends for the day, assume the expedition is spending the intervening time resting and recovering until play again commences. Since there are no monsters to be randomly encountered within the tomb, the party might be able to encamp close to the entrance without fear of being disturbed, but if you do so opt, do not inform the players of this.

As characters enter the various areas, read aloud appropriate sections of text, but never give any additional information that player characters would have no way of knowing, and avoid facial expressions or voice tones that might either give helpful hints or mislead players. The real enjoyment of this adventure is in managing to cope, and those players who do so with even moderate success will appreciate your refereeing properly and allowing them to "live or die" on their own.

The starting information given here simply assumes that the expedition has arrived at the site of the Tomb of Horrors. After relating the salient features of the "*Legend of the Tomb*," you may fill in whatever other background is needed to get the characters to the site.

### Adventure Start

The characters have arrived at the site of the demilich's last haunt. Before them is a low, flat topped hill, about 200 yards wide, 300 yards long, and 60 feet high. Only ugly weeds, thorns, and briars grow upon the steep sides and bald top of the mound. There are black rocks upon the top of the hill, and if these are viewed from a height of about 200 feet or so above the mound, it will be seen that the whole is shaped like a human skull, with piles of rock appearing as eyeholes, a nose hole, and the jagged teeth of a grinning death's head.

A thorough inspection and search of the entire area reveals only that the north side of the hill has a crumbling cliff of sand and gravel about 20 feet high in the middle of the whole. (This cliff face is represented by the northern edge of *map 7.1*.) A low stone ledge overhangs this eroded area, and shrubs and bushes obscure it from observation at a distance.

It takes 10 minutes for characters to search each 10-foot-wide space along the cliff face. This examination must be done from a distance, using a long spear or a 10-foot pole to poke into the sand and gravel, looking for an opening. Any prodding into the cliff face must be sufficiently high off the ground in order to collapse enough material to expose a portion of a tunnel entrance. Once an entrance is exposed, it takes about 1 hour for characters to thoroughly clear the passage that lies beyond, but a crawl space can be opened in 10 minutes.

Probing of the gravel and sand face can begin wherever the characters chooseÃ¢ÂÂeast side, west side, middle, several locations at once or merely a single one at a time. Leave this strictly to the players to decide. The best manner to handle it is to ask where they will search, once they have determined that they will investigate the area and they have stated how it will be done and with what. Remember that probing low to the ground, or probing with short implements (daggers, swords, and the like) will not reveal anything.

As soon as any entrance is cleared and entered, go to the appropriate location on *map 7.1*: either *area 1*, *area 2*, or *area 3*.

> ##### Demonic Attention
>
>Characters who become astral or ethereal in the tomb might attract a demon. Roll a d20 whenever this occurs.
>
>On a roll of 1 to 16, no demon appears. Otherwise the following demons could appear: 17, a **vrock**; 18, a **hezrou**; 19, a **glabrezu**; or 20, a **nalfeshnee**.
>

## Locations in the Tomb

The following locations are identified on map 7.1.

![Map 7.1: Tomb of Horrors](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/001-toh01.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/002-toh01_players.webp)
### 1. False Entrance Tunnel

If the characters clear the passage on the west side of the cliff face, read:

>>The corridor before you is made of plain stone, roughly worked, and it is dark and full of cobwebs. The ceiling overhead is obscured by hanging strands of webbing.
>>

Casual observation will not reveal that the ceiling, 20 feet overhead, is composed of badly fitting stones. The cobwebs must be burned away for someone to be able to inspect the tunnel ceiling. Anyone who does so and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check realizes that the ceiling is unstable and in danger of collapse.

Daylight is sufficient to reveal a pair of oaken doors at the end of the passageway. The doors open outward by means of great iron ring pulls. When either door is opened, it is revealed to be a false door, and the trap is triggered.

***Ceiling Trap.*** If the ceiling is prodded with any force, or if the doors are opened, the ceiling of the tunnel collapses. Creatures under the collapse must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap mechanism is beyond the doors and inside the ceiling, so it can't be disabled from outside.

![](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/002-totyp-07-03.webp)

### 2. False Entrance Tunnel

If the characters clear the passage on the east side of the cliff face, read:

>>The corridor before you is made of plain stone, roughly worked and mortared, with a 10-foot-high ceiling.
>>

Daylight will enable adventurers to dimly see what appear to be two separate doors at the end of the corridor.

The paving stones on the floor 50 feet south of the entrance are unmortared and shift slightly when characters tread upon the surface. A character who inspects the floor in this section and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the change in the floor. A character can use thieves' tools to keep the stones from shifting by taking 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the shims are put in place but they fail when someone moves across the stone, and the trap is triggered.

***Sliding Block Trap.*** If the paving stones shift when someone moves across them, a 10-foot-thick block of stone emerges from the midpoint of the eastern wall and begins to slide into the corridor. Have the players roll initiative. On each initiative count, the block slides 6 inches to the west, until at initiative count 1, it completely blocks the corridor. The block's movement can be stopped by using an iron bar or a similarly sturdy normal object, but only if the object is placed on the floor where it can be wedged into the space between the block and the floor. If the block moves far enough to prevent the characters from escaping, they have to devise a means to bypass it. It can't be moved or forced backward.

The doors at the end of the passage are false ones.

### 3. Entrance to the Tomb of Horrors

Even a bit of light entering through a crawl space or provided by a torch will reveal that an unusual tunnel lies ahead. If the characters clear the passage near the center of the cliff face, read:

>>Bright, brilliant colors are to be seen everywhere, the stones and pigments undimmed by the passage of decades. The floor of the corridor is a colorful mosaic of stone, with a distinct, winding path of red tiles about two feet wide snaking its way south down the corridor. No stonework can be seen on the walls or the ceiling twenty feet above, for some sort of cement or plaster has been smoothed over all of these surfaces and then illustrated.
>>
>>The scenes show fields with kine grazing, a copse with several wolves in the background, workers of various races and strange human-animal mixturesÃ¢ÂÂpig-human, ape-human, and dog-humanÃ¢ÂÂgoing about various tasks. Certain of the frescoes show rooms of some buildingÃ¢ÂÂa library filled with many books and scrolls, the door of a torture chamber, and a wizard's work room. There are chairs, windows, boxes, bales, doors, chests, birds, bats, spiders, and all manner of things shown on the walls.
>>

This corridor contains five covered pits (see the *sidebar*). On the west wall adjacent to the northernmost pit is where the torture chamber is painted. The wall hiding the passage to the west shows a depiction of an iron door that evidently confines some sort of horrid creature (its taloned and scaled hands grasp the bars of its small window). If the plaster and lath beneath this image is broken away, a normal, inward-opening door will be revealed. If the plaster remains intact, the door can be discovered only by magical means.

***Message from Acererak.*** If the path of red tiles on the floor is carefully observed and studied all the way from the entrance to where the path forks toward *areas 5* and *6*, the individual with such perseverance will be rewarded by suddenly understanding that a message is contained in barely noticeable runes in the mosaic floor.

The message reads:

>*Acererak congratulates you on your powers of observation, so make of this whatever you wish, for you will be mine in the end no matter what!*
>
>*Go back to the tormentor or through the arch, and the second great hall you'll discover.*
>
>*Shun green if you can, but night's good color is for those of great valor.*
>
>*If shades of red stand for blood, the wise will not need sacrifice aught but a loop of magical metalÃ¢ÂÂyou're well along your march.*
>
>*Two pits along the way will be found to lead to a fortuitous fall, so check the wall.*
>
>*These keys and those are most important of all, and beware of trembling hands and what will maul.*
>
>*If you find the false you find the true, and into the columned hall you'll come, and there the throne that's key and keyed.*
>
>*The iron men of visage grim do more than meets the viewer's eye.*
>
>*You've left and left and found my tomb, and now your souls will die.*
>

### 4. Fresco of the Wizardly Work Room

>>The most outstanding feature in this location is actually outstanding! Two jackal-headed human figures are painted so as to appear to be holding a real bronze chest that protrudes from the wall.
>>

***Poison Needle Trap.*** If the chest is examined closely, the viewer will note that it is hinged on the bottom so as to allow the lid to swing down if a catch on the top is pressed. The catch has an easily seen poison needle trapÃ¢ÂÂthe needle sticks 3 inches out of the wallÃ¢ÂÂand the needle can be avoided easily by pressing the catch with the pommel of a dagger. Disabling the trap by taking the needle out of the mechanism requires the use of thieves' tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check.

The needle deals 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage if it hits someone. Someone who takes this poison damage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.

***Deep Covered Pit.*** If the chest is opened, it appears to be empty, but a character who actually feels inside the chest will find a rod that protrudes vertically from the bottom. This lever moves easily, and if it is pulled with any force it will open a trapdoor in this square that covers a 30-foot-deep covered pit (see the sidebar). Someone who falls in takes damage from a 30-foot fall as well as from the spikes and the poison.

> ##### Covered Pits
>
>Pit traps throughout the tomb, except where otherwise noted, are constructed as covered pits. Each one is 10 feet deep and concealed by a counterweighted trapdoor that looks like the floor and opens as soon as any person steps on it.
>
>A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the edges of a pit's lid. In addition, someone who prods a pit lid can force the lid to open with a successful DC 10 Strength check. The lid can be wedged shut with a piton or a similar object. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check to place the shim properly. On a failed check, the shim fails if someone treads on the lid.
>
>Each pit is spiked at the bottom, so someone who falls in takes falling damage plus 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes. The spikes are also poisoned, so someone injured by them must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>

The trapdoor over this pit is 3 feet thick and can't be detected by sounding, and it is technically not a trap, so a *find traps* spell doesn't reveal it. A *true seeing* spell reveals a tiny rectangular gap where the door meets the floor. Once the trapdoor falls away, the pit remains open thereafter.

### 5. The Arch of Mist

One section of the path shown on the floor leads directly into a stone archway. If any character stands within 2 feet of the entranceway upon the path, read:

>>The stone archway before you is filled with a veil of thick vapors. The stones on either side of the base and the keystone protrude slightly from the stones around them. As you move to within touching distance, the left-hand base stone begins to glow yellow, the right-hand base stone orange, and the keystone seven feet above blue.
>>

Nothing will cause the vapors to clear, nor will any sort of magic allow sight into the area, until the glowing stones are pressed in the proper sequence: yellow, blue, orange. If this is done, the vapors disappear, and the path appears to go eastward.

If the archway is entered when it is clouded, those characters doing so will be instantly teleported to *area 7*. If it is passed through after pressing the glowing stones in proper sequence, those who step through while following the path will be teleported to *area 11*, and those who pass through off the path will be sent back to *area 3*.

### 6. The Face of the Great Green Devil

The path of red tiles leads south from the fork. If any character comes within 2 feet of the southern wall, read:

>>On the wall before you is a relief sculpture of a devil face formed of mosaic tiles. The face has a huge O of a mouth, inside of which the space is dead black.
>>

***Aura.*** The devil face radiates an aura of transmutation magic if *detect magic* is used on it, and a casting of *detect evil and good* or a paladin's use of Divine Sense reveals it as a desecrated place.

***Mouth Trap.*** The mouth opening is similar to a *sphere of annihilation*, but it is about 3 feet in diameterÃ¢ÂÂplenty of room for those who wish to leap in and be completely and forever destroyed. A character who examines the mouth and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the trap for what it is.

### 7. The Forsaken Prison

>>This miserable cubicle appears to have absolutely no means of egress. Three iron levers, each about one foot long, protrude from the south wall of the chamber.
>>

Even a magical means of detection will not indicate any way out of this place.

***Levers.*** The iron levers can be moved horizontally or vertically, singly or in combination. Only the act of moving all three together upward or downward has any results. Moving them up opens a small trapdoor in the center of the ceiling 10 feet above. Pushing them simultaneously down opens the entire floor to a 100-foot-deep pit with no exit. The floor returns to a closed position in 10 minutes, sealing any victim inside the pit until another creature triggers the floor trap again.

***Crawl Space.*** The ceiling route is a crawl space some 3 feet square. At the place it turns east there is a plug in the ceiling, which can be detected only with magic or if a character has sense enough to check for secret doors. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check can find the door. Also, anyone who raps or sounds on the ceiling in the door's area hears it is hollow, indicating a space beyond. Eventually the small tunnel leads to a magical one-way door, which opens in the pit side as shown, and players are back to square one.

### 8. Gargoyle Lair

When any door leading to the lair is opened, it frees the room's occupant from temporal stasis.

>>What appeared to be a statue an instant ago comes to life before your eyes. The creature flaps its wings and stares at you.
>>

***Creature.*** A mutated, **four-armed gargoyle** attacks anyone who enters its lair. This creature uses Multiattack to make three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Treasure.*** Around the creature's neck is a collar studded with ten gleaming gems (blue quartz stones of 100 gp value each).

Hidden in a secret compartment of the collar is a slip of parchment with the following written on it in magical code (requiring *comprehend languages* to understand): "Look low and high for gold, to hear a tale untold. Take the archway at the end, and on your way you'll wend." Beneath the runes, the initial "A" is inscribed.

### 9. Complex of Secret Doors

If someone opens the door on the east wall of area 8, read:

>>The small room beyond the door is empty and appears to have no other exits.
>>

The south wall contains the first in a series of secret doors. Each of these portals requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find and must be opened by hand using a particular method, as follows:

>A. Pull down and inward (hinged on bottom)
>
>B. Pivot on central hinge
>
>C. Pull inward and up at bottom (hinged on top)
>
>D. Slide up
>
>E. Pull double panels inward (hinged on sides)
>
>F. Slide left
>
>G. Door has seven studs in a rowÃ¢ÂÂpress all at once and door opens, but press 1 and 7 and the door falls inward. A character pressing the studs or near enough to do so must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the falling door.
>

***Bolts from Above.*** Each round that characters are in any of the rooms inside the complex of secret doors, a number of bolts will be fired into the area from hidden devices in the walls and ceilings, and there is a 50 percent chance that one character, randomly determined, in each such area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) piercing damage. There is no way to prevent the bolts from being triggered.

### 10. Great Hall of Spheres

This area is similar to *area 3*, for the floor is of inlaid tiles and the walls and ceiling are painted with figures of animals, strange signs and glyphs (which mean absolutely nothing), and humans and human-like creatures posing with spheres of different colors. These globes are two-dimensional, of course, and their significance and pattern are described below. From north to south, with the west wall being the left-hand column, and the east the right-hand, the spheres are colored and positioned as follows:

| West Wall                   | East Wall                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Gold, held high overhead 1  | Pale blue, held at shoulder   |
| Orange, held waist high     | Silver, at feet               |
| (False door)                | (Secret one-way door 2 )      |
| Purple, at feet             | Green, held high overhead     |
| (False door)                | Yellow, held at shoulder      |
| Bronze, held waist high     | Pink held high overhead       |
| Gray, held at shoulder      | Black, at feet 3              |
| (None)                      | Pale violet, held at shoulder |
| Bright blue, at feet        | (None)                        |
| White, held high overhead   | Red, held waist high 4        |
| Turquoise, held at shoulder | Buff, at feet                 |
| Scarlet, held waist high    | (None)                        |
| Pale green, at feet         | Indigo, held high overhead    |

1 An illusion covering a crawlway to *area 11*

2 This door can be opened by a *knock* spell or destroyed with *disintegrate*

3 An illusion covering a crawlway to *area 14*

4 An illusion covering a crawlway to *area 13*

The false doors and secret doors can be found with successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) checks. If anyone makes physical contact with an illusion in this area, its nature becomes apparent. Also, a character who examines an illusory image without touching it can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a successful check, the illusion becomes faint to the character, who can then easily see the crawlway beyond the illusion.

***Magic Archway.*** On the south wall is a stone archway similar in appearance to *area 5*, also filled with cloudy vapors that block vision or detection of what lies beyond. When a character moves to within 3 feet of the arch, read:

>>As you come close, three stones in the archway in front of you begin to glow. The left-hand base stone shines with an olive hue; the one on the right glows citron, and the keystone seven feet overhead gives off russet light.
>>

No matter how the stones are manipulated, the archway remains clouded and veiled with a haze which nothing can enable the onlookers to see through. All living matter which goes through the arch will be teleported to *area 3*, while nonliving matter is teleported simultaneously to *area 33*Ã¢ÂÂmeaning that characters stepping through will appear at the start totally nude, while everything else with them will go to the *crypt of the demilich*. (Cruel, but most entertaining for the DM.)

### 11. The Three-Armed Statue

>>This small room holds what appears to be a statue of a gargoyle, eight feet tall, with four arms. One of the arms is broken off and lies on the floor in front of the statue.
>>

![](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/003-totyp-07-04.webp)

No amount of fooling around with the broken arm will enable it to be replaced, and the statue will do nothing at all meanwhile.

***Ten Gems for One.*** A close look at the open and outstretched hands of the statue will determine that a large gem (a 100 gp blue quartz fits perfectly) will fit in a carved depression in each of the three remaining hands, while the broken one has no such concavity. If three large gems of any sort are placed within the hands, the stony digits will close and crush them to powder, dump the remains on the floor, and return to their normal positions.

If this process is repeated until ten gems (or more) are crushed, a *magic mouth* spell is triggered and speaks the following words: "Your sacrifice was not in vain. Look to the fourth to find your gain."

As these words are uttered, an invisible *gem of seeing* will come into being in the palm of the broken-off arm. The gem must be found, and the character so doing will need to wipe it free of a magical substance before it can be seen or used. Note that if the arm is carelessly moved, the gem will fall out and roll away. *See invisibility* or any other sort of searching except by careful feeling will be useless. Describe the gem, once it is wiped clean and visible, as an oval diamond, with two flat and polished sides, very clear, and about 1 inch in diameter by a quarter-inch thick. It will operate only twelve times, then shatter.

### 12. Trapped False Doors

In four locations in the tomb, there are false doors which screen a spear trap. When one of these doors is opened, a spear will shoot out, and the door opener or someone standing nearby is subject to be struck. Determine at random, if need be, which character is the target. The trap has a range of 60 feet, has a +11 bonus to hit, and deals 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the door is closed and reopened, another spear will fire. The mechanism can be jammed by a character who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check.

### 13. Chamber of Three Chests

When the party enters the illusory crawlway hidden by the red sphere, they will come to an apparent dead end, but a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the presence of a secret door.

The character who opens the door will fall to the floor 10 feet below due to a tilting stone at the mouth of the crawlway, taking falling damage (a mere annoyance, but it erodes the strength of the party).

Three large chests are affixed firmly to the floor; the western one is gold (plate covering iron), the center one is silver (plate over iron), and the eastern one is of oak bound with thick bronze bands. Each is about 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 3 feet high.

***Gold.*** Opening the gold chest releases a **swarm of poisonous snakes** that slither out and attack next round. They continue biting until all are killed.

***Silver.*** Inside the silver chest is a clear crystal box (worth 1,000 gp) that holds a *ring of protection*. Someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check while examining the box and the chest notices the box is set into the chest bottom. When this box is lifted from the supposed bottom of the chest, eight darts will fire upward, and the one or two characters leaning over the chest so as to be in the line of fire will take 1d4 attacks each if they are exposed to the path of these missiles. The darts have a range of 60 feet, a +11 bonus to hit, and deal 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The trap mechanism is under the crystal box and can't be disabled without first removing the box.

***Oak.*** When the lid of the oak chest is opened, an animated **giant skeleton** (see *appendix B*) will be instantly teleported into the room, and it strikes with surprise.

### 14. Chapel of Evil

After passing through the illusory black sphere the party will have crawled along the small tunnel until reaching the end, only to find it is solid stone. It requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find the secret door at the end of the passageÃ¢ÂÂno form of magic will detect it, save for a *gem of seeing*. If the characters open the door and enter the room, read:

>>You see what is obviously some form of temple area. There are scenes of normal life painted on the walls, but the people have rotting flesh, skeletal hands, worms eating them, and so forth. Yet there are also depicted various religious symbols of good alignment. There is a mosaic path leading between four rows of wooden pews that face the worship area. In front of the pews, a wooden railing divides the room. South of it is an altar in front of a tiered dais, on which sits a wooden chair.
>>

If the characters move farther into the room so they can see the features in the south end, continue:

>>The chair is nicely carved and padded but seems unremarkable. On either side of the dais are large, free-standing large brass candelabras each holding five white candles. In each corner on the southern wall is a large white pottery urn stoppered with a brass and wood plug. Sprawled on the floor near the west wall is human skeleton in black chain mail that is badly rusted and damaged. The skeleton's outstretched arm points to a stone archway set in the wall. The opening is filled with opaque, bright orange vapors.
>>

***Aura.*** A casting of *detect evil and good* or a paladin's use of Divine Sense identifies the chapel as a consecrated place. (What a puzzle! Could the demilich actually have been of good alignment?)

***Pews.*** Simple examination indicates that all of the benches have hinged seats. If a character examines either of the pews in the front row before opening the lid, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the hinges on this pew are larger than the ones on the pews in the other rows.

***Gas Trap.*** The hinges on the front pews are larger and stronger because they include rods that are connected to valves inside the pew. If the seat on either of the front pews is lifted up, a cloud of poison gas fills the whole room in 2 rounds. A character caught in the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 48 hours.

If the hinges are noticed and then disassembled, requiring 1 minute and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools for each hinge, the trap can't trigger. A failed check results in no progress at the task, but if the check fails by 5 or more, the trap goes off explosively, blowing the lid open.

***Treasure.*** The back pair of pews have 4,000 sp each hidden therein, the next pair have 3,000 ep each, and the pair closest to the trapped pews have 2,000 gp each.

***Altar.*** The centerpiece of the chapel is a block of strange material that glows with an inner light of opalescent blue. (If the altar is specifically targeted by a *detect evil and good* spell, it registers very faintly as a desecrated object.) If the altar is touched by living matter, a *lightning bolt* spell (save DC 15) will streak down the center aisle. After this bolt comes forth, the altar turns a fiery blue-red, and if it thereafter is touched by any object it will explode as a *fireball* spell (save DC 15).

***Archway.*** Just as in other locations around the tomb, the mists that obscure the archway can't be penetrated with any sort of vision or magic. (If a character moves close to the archway and asks about it, explain that none of the stones of the arch glow.) The skeleton, of course, misleads the party, for any character passing through the portal will enter a 10-foot-by-10-foot room where their sex and alignment are reversed by a powerful magic. Exiting the room and reentering the archway will restore original alignment, but also deals 3 (1d6) psychic damage. Going back a third time will reverse sex again, but the individual will be teleported in the manner of the archway in *area 10*. Only a *wish* spell will restore both alignment and sex. If alignment is restored by entering the orange portal, a *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell will then restore original sex.

***Wall Slot.*** A character who inspects the eastern wall directly opposite the archway and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a small slot with the letter O faintly traced above it. This is the location of a moving stone block described below. The block can't be magically detected, nor will it open by physical or magical means other than the method given in area 15.

### 15. Stone Gate

As shown on the map, the stone that forms part of the eastern wall of the chapel is 2 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 10 feet thick in a wedge shape. It is impregnated with strong antimagic that prevents its detection or removal or its change to another form or substance. The wall slot (see above) is of sufficient size to accept a coin or a disc-shaped gem. It is also just right for the insertion of a magic ring of any sort. Only such an item will trigger the mechanism, which causes the block to sink slowly into the floor so as to allow entry into the passage beyond. The object deposited into the slot is forever lost, as the sinking stone crushes all to pieces. The gate opens easily from the other (east) side, and no special item is required to trigger its opening from that side.

***Doors and Pits.*** Beyond the gate stone, the corridor widens to 10 feet and turns southward where steps lead down steeply to a corridor that goes west. Each of the three doors in the corridor opens easily if any pushing force is applied to it, and a creature that does so stumbles into the pit on the other side unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If a door isn't violently pushed against, it can be opened safely by pulling it inward, and the party will have standard chances of falling in when the characters leading the way step on the pit cover.

By the time the westernmost door and pit have been reached, the characters will certainly expect the pit, and will be likely to bypass and ignore it. This carelessness would prevent them from examining the pit from within. On the south wall of the pit is a wooden door painted to look like stone, which is easily discovered by anyone who looks at this wall while inside the pit or who makes a tactile investigation of the wall from outside the pit.

***Crawl Space.*** Beyond the painted door is a narrow passage that emerges at the top of a short flight of stairs leading down.

### 16. Locked Oaken Door

>>The thick wooden door ahead of you is heavily bound with iron bands, and there are several locks keeping it shut.
>>

***Aura.*** The door is found to radiate an aura of abjuration magic if a *detect magic* spell is cast upon it.

***Sounds from Beyond.*** A character who listens with an ear to the door will hear far-off music and happy singing, obviously coming from the other side of the door.

No amount of forcing or spells will open the door. The only way to continue northward is to use a *disintegrate* spell on the door or physically destroy it (it has 100 hit points).

If the characters destroy the door, read:

>>As the door falls away, you can hear sounds of confusion and distress coming from the north. A faint glow, like that of a small flame, shines in the distance. The walls of the passage ahead of you are of smooth white alabaster, and the floor is highly polished, smoke-gray marble.
>>

![](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/004-totyp-07-05.webp)

The destruction of the door triggered a *minor illusion* spell that produced the noises of distress, which are designed to lure the characters onward.

The tunnel floor is a counterweighted beam. Its overbalancing point is the third square north of the door. When one or more characters move there, the floor beyond the door will begin to tilt downward, with the north end slowly sinking. If this occurs, quickly state how the floor is beginning to slant, and have the characters roll initiative. On initiative count 10, all characters north of the door fall prone and slide 10 feet to the north.

A character can attempt to scramble back up the ramp to the south by making a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, or two successful checks if using the Dash action. Those who succeed still slide 10 feet north on initiative count 10 in each round, but they can also climb upward according to the normal rules for doing so. A character whose check fails by 5 or more slides an extra 5 feet to the north. Those who slide to the fourth square north of the door take 3 (1d6) fire damage, then 11 (2d10) fire damage in the fifth square. Characters who slide farther than that are plunged into a pit of molten lava which will absolutely snuff them out.

### 17. Magical Secret Door

This entrance to the remainder of the tomb is on the wall adjoining the stairway that leads down. It can be found by mundane means, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, but nothing will enable it to be opened until either the area is viewed through a *gem of seeing*, a *true seeing* spell is cast, or a *detect magic* spell is used to determine the door's magic aura (abjuration).

After the magic of the door is identified, a *dispel magic* or *remove curse* spell is needed to remove the guard that prevents the door from being opened. Once this is accomplished, the secret door can be opened easily from either side.

### 18. Corridor Protected by Fear Gas

If the characters travel south from the secret door, they reach a landing at the top of a stairway.

>>Stairs descend to the west. The corridor that extends past the bottom of the steps is slightly cloudy.
>>

The corridor is filled with fear gas. Unless characters announce they are holding their breath before entering its 40-foot length, they will breathe in the gas. A creature exposed to the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.

A creature frightened in this way must take the Dash action on each of its turns to retrace its steps, moving away from this area of the tomb by the safest route possible. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. Once the effect ends, the creature is immune to the gas for 1 hour.

Beyond the first 10 feet, the gas becomes thicker, and it irritates the eyes. The area is lightly obscured, so it requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the south door that leads into area 18A. Once that door is opened, the gas dissipates.

### 18A. False Crypt

>>Beyond the door, a stairway leads down. The way is blocked by thick webbing that fills the area from steps to ceiling.
>>

The steps down to the chamber at the end are filled with *webs* (as the spell) which can only be removed by magical fire (a *burning hands* spell, a *flame tongue* sword, or the like). Any character trying to break through them will become hopelessly entangled and can't get loose unless the webs are burned away or the character is freed by a *wish* spell.

If the characters clear away the webs and descend to the foot of the stairway, read:

>>Lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs is an iron mace inlaid with silver. South of this location is a modest-sized room. What you can see of it is filled with rotting and decayed furnishings.
>>

The mace will begin to glow with a bright golden light when it is picked up by any character. (Whenever this weapon is swung at the occupant of this chamber, it will hit.)

Characters who enter the room will see a solid gold couch along the back wall. A skeletal figure that resembles a lich, wearing a crown on its head, slowly rises from the couch (and throws up its hands in apparent fear if the mace is being carried). A booming voice seeming to emanate from the whole of the chamber will demand: "Who dares to disturb the rest of Acererak? It is your death which you have found!"

***Creature.*** The false crypt is the home of a false lich that is actually a magically prepared **greater zombie** (see *appendix B*). Between strikes the creature will gesture with its hands as if readying a spell. If it is struck by the golden mace it will make a roaring bellow (produced by a *magic mouth* spell), and the weapon will obviously stagger it (roll dice and shake your head ruefully) every time the mace is used. The third time it is struck by the glowing mace, the false lich will instantly wither and disappear in a puff of dust, and the mace will shatter.

If the characters investigate the room's contents, they can see a jade coffer, the dead monster's fallen crown, and a fine leather bag (its condition is a give-awayÃ¢ÂÂit isn't rotten) all within easy reach. The furnishings and decorations are of no value.

***Collapse.*** At the moment when the false lich disappears, the room will start to shake and stones will begin to come down from the ceiling. Obviously the place is beginning to collapse, but take your time detailing the increasing rumblings, tremors, grinding noises, falling hunks of ceiling, and so forth to the players.

Now begin counting slowly to 10, and it is odds on that there will be a stampede up the stairs to get away! A *programmed illusion* spell affecting the entire false crypt will produce the full effects of a cave-in, complete with tactile components. Actual dust will billow up the stairs, while bits of stone begin to fall in the eastÃ¢ÂÂwest tunnel and then in the northÃ¢ÂÂsouth tunnel and the stairs reached from the pit. If the party runs out, ask them if they thought it was too hard a dungeon.

***Treasure.*** The jade coffer is worth 5,000 gp and contains six *potions of healing*. The crown is set with gems and worth 25,000 gp. (The gold that makes up the couch is worth 50,000 gp, but it can't be moved or damaged.) The small sack holds 278 pp, twenty-nine gems worth 10 gp each, seven *spell scrolls* (all of 1st- and 2nd-level wizard spells), and a map showing a location several hundred miles away that supposedly has a rich treasure (it is a fake, naturally).

***False Ending.*** If this outcome doesn't make the players suspicious enough to take another run through to check things out, put the adventure away for use when you have a different group (or the same ones) inquiring about one of the references in the "*Legend of the Tomb*." Note that something so simple as a *commune* spell will reveal that the demilich has not been destroyed.

### 19. Laboratory and Mummy Preparation Room

Although there is only one item of eventual use within this totally plain and cluttered place, the volume of items within it is calculated to waste time for the players. Describe the features of the room as the characters investigate.

All of the walls are lined with shelves, and upon these are old jars filled with dust and impotent ingredients of all sorts. There is a large desk and stool, two workbenches, and two mummy preparation tables. Clay pots and urns on these tables and the floor obviously once contained unguents, ointments, oils, perfumes, and the like. Linen wrappings are in rolls or strewn about. Dried herbs of unidentifiable nature, bones, skulls and the like litter the workbenches.

***Vats.*** In the south part of the room are three vats of about 7 feet in diameter and 4 feet in depth that contain murky liquids. The vats are affixed to the floor and too heavy to move. The western one holds only dirty water.

The middle vat contains a slow-acting acid which will deal 3 (1d6) acid damage on the round after a creature's flesh comes into substantial contact with it (by immersing an arm, being splashed on, and so forth)Ã¢ÂÂminor contact (dipping a finger) will cause only a mild itch. At the bottom of this vat is one-half of a golden key.

The eastern vat contains a grayish substance that is actually an **ochre jelly** that sits atop the other half of the golden key.

***Treasure.*** The key parts are magical and will not be harmed by anything. If the parts are joined together they form one solid key, hereafter called the First Key. Because the acid will harm even magic weapons, the players will have to figure some way to neutralize or drain off the contents of the second vat to acquire the key, as a reach-in-and-grope-for-it technique has only a 1 percent cumulative chance per round of being successful.

### 20. Huge Pit Filled with Spikes

![](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/005-totyp-07-06.webp)

If the characters proceed through the laboratory, they come upon a descending staircase that ends at a corridor heading east. Assuming they can see what lies ahead of them, read:

>>A ten-foot-deep, empty pit completely fills the passageway and extends so far as to make jumping across it impossible for most creatures.
>>

***Spike Trap.*** The characters might deduce that the pit can be crossed by climbing down and walking across the bottom, then climbing up the other side. Simple! WrongÃ¢ÂÂany footstep upon the last 5 feet (east portion) of the pit presses a pressure plate, causing a volley of spikes to discharge upward. If the plate is triggered, each person in the pit or leaning over its edge is likely to be struck by the spikes, which have a +11 bonus to hit and deal 11 (2d10) piercing damage. New spikes will come up out of the floor every time if the plate is pressed more than once.

A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers the pressure plate. It can then be wedged shut by a character who is adjacent to the plate and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check while using thieves' tools. On a failed check, it's apparent that the block didn't workÃ¢ÂÂunless the check fails by 5 or more, in which case the job seems solid but fails when someone walks on the plate.

### 21. The Agitated Chamber

The secret door to this place can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

>>The room appears to be filled with funerary offerings and furniture. There are four rotting sofas, a couple of throne-like chairs, and a jumble of stands, small tables, and vases and urns that are dented, chipped, and broken. Only the rather plain tapestries hanging on the east and west walls appear to have been spared a rough looting. Amid the general havoc are scattered several trunks and a larger number of coffers.
>>

***Heaving Floor.*** The weight of the characters upon the balanced floor of this room sets a mechanism into motion. Each round they remain in the place, on initiative count 0, roll a die. An odd-numbered result means that the floor of the room will jump and buck up and down violently. When the floor does so, each creature in the room must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 1 bludgeoning damage from abrasions and contusions.

***Tapestries.*** The wall hangings, which depict weed-grown rocks and green and golden tan scenes of undersea life, are special, antimagic-treated creations made of green slime and brown mold (see "*Dungeon Hazards*" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

If either tapestry is torn down, it instantly turns into green slime and covers a 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide area of floor when it falls. Note that the tapestries can be handled normally without risk, just not yanked so as to tear them (and they are well affixed at the top); if any character is holding one when the room becomes agitated, however, it is 75 percent probable that the jerking motion will tear the thing.

If these hangings are subjected to burning, they instantly turn to brown mold that covers the same area.

The secret door behind the tapestry on the west wall requires the tapestry to be removed, but thereafter can be found as easily as the entry door.

***Treasure.*** The trunks are empty, but the smaller coffers hold various items. Roll a d6 each time one is opened. On a roll of 1Ã¢ÂÂ3, the coffer contains 1d3 **poisonous snakes**. On a roll of 4Ã¢ÂÂ5, 8d10 pp are found. On a roll of 6, the coffer holds 2d4 gems (worth 10 gp each).

### 22. The Cavern of Gold and Silver Mists

>>A thick silver mist, shot through with delicate streamers of gold, partially blocks your view of the area that lies ahead.
>>

The mists make the entire area heavily obscured. A *detect evil and good* spell cast in the area, or a paladin's use of Divine Sense, indicates that this is a consecrated place.

Any creature that steps into the mist must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them. This effect lasts until the character can breathe the clean air above ground under the warm sun.

***Creature.*** At the center of the cavern is a small grotto in which dwells the fey being **Siren** (see *appendix B*). As a private joke, Acererak placed her in this cavern under an enchantment. She must be asked to come out of the chamber in order to break the spell, and she can give no clues as to the nature of her durance. If the characters come close enough, they can see that two sacks, a large one and a small one, are lying on the floor next to her.

**Siren** will converse in a friendly fashion, asking how characters are and if they find the going hard in the tomb. Because of the enchantment, she will answer any direct questions with an evasive reply: "I cannot say," "That is unknown to me," "Possibly," and so forth unless she is freed. She knows nothing of the tomb in any event.

If the characters ask her to come with them and are kind, she will do so and stay with them through the rest of the adventure.

***Treasure.*** Both of **Siren**'s sacks contain treasure, but it isn't possible to acquire more than one of hemÃ¢ÂÂand in fact both of the sacks will disappear if she is asked to accompany the party. If a character touches one of the sacks before she is asked to come along, she and the other sack immediately disappear.

The large sack contains 50 pieces each of copper, silver, electrum, gold and platinum. It appears to be a normal sack, but it has a magical aura if it is checked, for it is a *bag of holding*.

To determine the contents of the small sack, roll a d10:

| d10 | Contents                                                                        |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1Ã¢ÂÂ2 | Filled with wool                                                                |
| 3Ã¢ÂÂ4 | Five pieces of jewelry                                                          |
| 5Ã¢ÂÂ6 | 1d6 *potions of greater healing*                                                |
|  7  | 1d6 *spell scrolls*, each of a wizard spell of 5th level or lower (DM's choice) |
|  8  | 4d12 gems (worth 100 gp each)                                                   |
|  9  | *Bracers of defense*                                                            |
|  10 | *Ring of feather falling*                                                       |

It isn't possible to gain both the large and the small sacks by any means. If a character or characters state they will grab them simultaneously, roll dice to see which sack is touched a fraction of a second sooner. The other disappearsÃ¢ÂÂalong with **Siren**Ã¢ÂÂforever.

### 23. False/True Door

When the party opens the door that promises to offer access to the north, it is probable that they will believe it to be nothing more than a false door, but the seemingly blank wall of solid stone behind the false door hides a secret door, which can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Secret Trapdoor.*** On the other side of the secret door is a secret trapdoor in the floor of the corridor, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. The trapdoor opens onto a steep flight of narrow stairs that spiral down to a 5-foot-wide tunnel which emerges at *area 24*.

### 23A. Knockout Corridor

If the characters don't find the tunnel or choose not to follow it, they move through a door that leads east and then come upon a set of double doors in the north wall. When the doors to the north are opened, sleep gas billows forth from the other side. Each creature in the east-west passage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 2d4 ÃÂ 10 minutes.

***Rolling Stone.*** Every 10 minutes after the gas is released, roll a d4. On a roll of 4, a stone juggernaut (rather like a steam roller) comes out of the 20-foot-square room to the north and rolls 1d6 ÃÂ 10 feet south, then west. Everything it rolls over is squashed to a pulp. There is no appeal.

### 24. Adamantine Door

The tunnel from the south emerges into a corridor that then heads east. The door at the end is a great block of adamantine. It has permanent antimagic effects on it, and there is no magical or physical way of forcing entry.

There are three slots in the door at about waist height. If sword blades are shoved simultaneously into all the slots, the 1-foot-thick door will swing open. Five rounds later, the door slams shut. There is no way of opening it from the east side.

### 25. Pillared Throne Room

>>You look upon an enormous chamber colored in pastels. A forest of massive, many-hued columns support the ceiling.
>>

![](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/006-totyp-07-08.webp)

***Aura.*** Each of the 3-foot-diameter pillars radiates an aura of transmutation magic when such is detected for.

***Upwardly Mobile.*** Any character who touches a pillar with or without intent will uncontrollably float upward (as if affected by a *levitate* spell), then bounce gently around on the ceiling, 30 feet above, just as a helium balloon. To stop this effect, a *dispel magic* or *remove curse* spell must be placed upon each such individual.

There seems to be a gentle breeze in the room, for any character floating among the many-hued columns will begin drifting toward the northwest or northeast corner of the room. From the entry an observant character with a suitable light source will be able to observe part of the dais on the south wall and the door at *area 27*.

***Northwest Devil Face.*** About 24 feet above the floor in the northwest corner, on the north wall, is a mosaic relief sculpture of a green devil's face which appears to be exactly the same as that first encountered in the entrance hall to the tomb (*area 3*). Any creature that comes within 3 feet of its gaping mouth will be sucked in and instantly teleported, to be "spat out" nude at *area 6*, while all non-living matter in the character's possession goes to *area 33*.

***Northeast Devil Face.*** The sculpture in the northeast corner is identical in size and placement to the one in the other corner, but it is tinged with a bluish color over the green. Any character that enters the mouth opening of this devil face is teleported to *area 27A*.

***Charred Remains.*** Strewn near the southeast corner is a heap of charred bones and skulls, plus the crisped and blackened remains of clothing and gear, arms and armorÃ¢ÂÂa thoroughly awful and frightening sight. A character who comes close enough to examine the remains will find a huge, glowing orange gem at the center of the destruction.

***Cursed Gem.*** The gem can be easily claimed. Casting a *detect evil and good* spell reveals it to be a desecrated object. On a casting of *detect magic*, the gem gives off a strong aura of conjurationÃ¢ÂÂso strong that the detecting character will get the vague feeling that the *wish* spell is involved in the gem's magic.

The gem is actually a cursed magic item. If any character touches it and attempts to cast a *wish* spell using it, a reversed or distorted version of the wish's fulfillment will bring harm to that character and all named in the wish.

Then, immediately after the evil *wish* spell has transpired, the gem begins to pulse with reddish lights, growing progressively stronger, brighter and hotter. Roll initiative. On initiative count 1, the stone explodes, absolutely killing any character within a 15-foot radius in a wave of searing radiation and flames. The gem remains as a noisome mass of stinking purplish mold which bubbles and chuckles. In one week the mass will again re-form as a glowing orange gem.

***Ebony Dais and Silver Throne.*** When the characters come close enough to see the details on the dais, read:

>>Contrasting with the pastel colors of the floor and pillars of the hall is the stark blackness of the huge dais on the south wall, atop which sits an obsidian throne inlaid with silver and ivory skulls. Upon the throne rest a crown made of gold and a scepter made of electrum, with a gold knob on one end and a silver cap on the other.
>>

***Aura.*** The crown and both ends of the scepter prove to be magical if such is detected for. In addition, the crown and the gold knob of the scepter radiate an aura of abjuration magic, and the silver end of the scepter has an aura of necromancy magic.

***Crown and Scepter.*** The crown negates the pillars' levitation effect for anyone who dons it and enables the wearer to see within the hall as if in normal daylightÃ¢ÂÂbut outside this place the wearer is blind. As soon as a creature puts on the crown, the wearer knows that the crown can be removed only by touching the scepter to it, but doesn't find out the exact procedure.

If the golden knob is touched to the crown, the wearer can remove the headgear. If the silver end of the scepter is touched to the crown, the wearer is instantly snuffed out, turning to a fetid powder that can't be brought back to life no matter what (*wish* spells notwithstanding).

***Treasure.*** Each of these items is obviously valuable (25,000 gp for the crown, 12,500 gp for the scepter), but both are cursed. If they are removed from the tomb, the possessor of either item will be visited by a **vrock** sent to reclaim the item and return it to the throne roomÃ¢ÂÂor by two such demons if a single character has both items.

***Throne Passage.*** A character who examines the throne and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a small replica of the crown inlaid in silver on the lower front panel of the seat. If the silver end of the scepter is applied to this inlay, the throne sinks down and reveals a 5-foot-wide passageway that leads south.

### 26. Small Room with a Door of Electric Blue

The two doors near the northern corners of the throne room look the same. When a character comes within 10 feet of either one, it can be seen that the door actually shimmers with a faint blue light. When the door is touched, this glimmering grows bright. A brass pull beckons to be used, and the door will open easily. Inside the western room there is nothing but dust. The eastern room is another matter.

If the eastern door is opened, the characters will see a low stone table upon which rests a wooden sarcophagus. Various broken and looted urns and coffers are scattered about. Inside the sarcophagus are the parts of a mummy (not an undead, exactly, for at this time it is the mummified remains of a human) with wrappings partially undone and tattered.

***Treasure.*** A huge amethyst, worth 5,000 gp, is barely visible between the wrappings that cover the mummy's head. A character who examines the mummy and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check can discover it in one of the eye sockets.

***Creature.*** The gem has an evil magic placed upon it, and if it is removed from the mummy, the remains become a true **mummy lord** that has no spells and no legendary actions (defeating it awards half XP). Magic upon the mummy lord's wrappings makes them nonflammable, and the creature wears a *ring of resistance (fire)*.

### 27. The Portal of Scintillating Violet

The door in the center of the north wall of the throne room appears to lead to another small room. Like the two near the corners, this one gives off a faint glow when viewed from 10 feet away, though this light is of a lilac color.

When this door is touched, the light changes to a bright and coruscating purple with tinges of sickly green. If a character opens the door, read:

>>You see a bare chamber, with a small door on the north wall, and pairs of swords crossed behind shields hung upon the walls. There are three such sets on each of the walls to either hand, and two sets on the north wall, one flanking each side of the door.
>>

***Creatures.*** If the threshold of the chamber is crossed by any creature, one set of swords will fly off the wall and attack the individual so doing. The two **flying swords** will both attack, and the shield (statistics as the swords, but no attacks) will interpose itself to take hits meant for the swords. This trio will attack until they are destroyed or the one who violated their area is dead. Surviving weapons and shields return to their former positions after the offender is hacked to pieces.

Worse still, if the threshold is crossed a second time, another pair of blades and a shield will attack, and each set gains a cumulative +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as 1 hit point more than the previous set.

Only the following spells will affect these items: *telekinesis* sends all three items of a set back to their original position; *heat metal* will cause one item to fall to pieces; *disintegrate* will destroy all items of a set; *magic weapon* will cause a sword to become a plain iron weapon.

### 27A. Chamber of Hopelessness

Any creature unfortunate enough to be teleported here from *area 25* is doomed, for its fate is clearly stated in glowing letters magically written on the north wall of the place. If someone arrives here, read:

>>"You who dared to violate my tomb now pay the price. Stay here and die slowly of starvation, or open and enter the door to the south, where certain but quick death awaits.
>>
>>"Whichever you choose, know that I, Acererak the Eternal, watch and scoff at your puny efforts and enjoy your death throes."
>>

***Fountain.*** A small stream of water spills from a wall outlet into a basin and drains away through side holes, so there is always plenty to drink. (It is impossible to flood the place, for there are hundreds of small drain holes in the walls and floor.)

***Treasure.*** There are numerous skeletons here, rotting equipment, and 30d10 each of sp, ep, gp, and pp hurled about. Searching through the remains will yield 2d10 gems (worth 10 gp each), a *potion of diminution*, and a *+1 flail*.

***Swords and Shields.*** If the door to the south is opened from this side, all the swords and shields in *area 27* swoop from the walls to attack, but they cease as soon as the door opener retreats into the chamber to the north.

### 28. The Wondrous Foyer

The narrow passage behind the throne leads to a 10-foot-wide landing and a series of steps which become wider to the south as they ascend. When a character reaches the landing and is able to see the steps, read:

>>The walls of the area ahead are untarnished and gleaming copper panels set between rare woods inlaid with ivory. The ceiling is silver, formed so as to reflect and amplify light brought into the place. The chamber widens to the south, where a set of gently sloping steps leads upward. The six steps, from nearest to farthest, are made of onyx, pink marble, lapis, black marble, yellow serpentine, and malachite.
>>

Upon the black marble step is a large, cylindrical key of bronze, hereafter called the *Second Key*, for all to behold. It has an *antipathy/sympathy* spell cast upon it (save DC 17) that repels humanoids (the antipathy effect). At the head of the steps are a pair of huge doors.

### 29. The Valves of Mithral

The doors at the top of the stairs are 14 feet wide and 28 feet tall. They are made of solid mithral, 3 feet thick, and impregnated with great magics in order to make them absolutely spell- and magic-proof.

***Keyhole.*** Where these valves meet, at about waist height, is a cup-like depression, a hemispherical concavity with a central hole. The hole appears to fit the Second Key, but if it is inserted, the character so doing will take 5 (1d10) lightning damage. Anyone so foolish as to insert the First Key (from *area 19*) will take double that amount of damage.

***True Key.*** The real key to these great gates is the scepter from *area 25*. If the gold knob is inserted into the depression, the mithral doors will swing silently open. If the silver end of the scepter is touched to the hemispherical cup the holder of the instrument will be teleported instantly to be spat out of the devil's mouth at *area 6*, nude, while all non-living materials with the individual go to *area 33*, and the crown and the scepter reappear on the throne.

***Blood Trap.*** If the door is attacked by force it will not budge, but if it is scratched or nicked it will turn red in that spot, and if it is cut by a sharp weapon it will begin to gush forth bloodÃ¢ÂÂthe blood of all those who have died within the tomb! The red flow will cascade down the steps and fill the area to the top of the southernmost step in 6 rounds, and each round thereafter it will rise higher and encompass one more step. If unchecked, the flow of blood will fill the foyer to the ceiling in 20 rounds.

Fire of any sort, magical or otherwise, turns the blood to a poison gas, which is fatal, and all characters in the foyer area are dead, with no saving throw, while any in the 5-foot-wide passage to the throne room are slain unless they succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

Casting one or more *cure wounds* spells on the door in any combination that expends four spell slots (such as four 1st-level castings, two 2nd-level, or one 4th-level) will stanch the flow of blood, as will a *heal* spell. If other magic is used against the blood, only the following spells will have any effect:

*Cone of cold* freezes the blood and halts the flow for 3 rounds.

*Create or destroy water* turns the blood to water.

*Disintegrate* destroys all the blood.

*Levitate* coagulates the blood and causes it to rise up as a Huge red **ochre jelly**.

*Polymorph* changes the blood into seven **wights**, which attack immediately.

*Purify food and drink* turns all the blood to poison gas. A character caught in the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 48 hours.

*Raise dead* or *resurrection* destroys all the blood and causes a shade to appear on the top stair. The shade blesses the characters so that they benefit as if they had just finished a long rest.

### 30. False Treasure Room

>>This imposing chamber has a silvered ceiling, just as the foyer has, so it is brightly illuminated by reflected light. The walls are of ivory with gold inlaid. The floor is polished agate. In each corner stands a statue of black iron, easily nine feet tall. That to the northeast stands with a saw-toothed two-handed sword raised to strike; that to the northwest a huge, spike-ended mace; to the southeast the sculpture holds a wickedly spiked morning star, and the one in the southwest has a voulge.
>>
>>Near the center of the room is a large bronze urn filigreed in gold. A thin stream of smoke issues from a tiny vent in its brass stopper. On the southern wall stands a granite sarcophagus that appears to be damaged. Flanking the sarcophagus are two large iron chests.
>>

The room is lined with lead and has antimagic properties, so no spells will work within the room, and no magical properties of items of any sort will properly function except those that detect an aura of magic or a place of desecration.

***Statues.*** Each statue has a magical aura, but they are merely hunks of metal; they do nothing. Each registers to the casting of *detect evil and good* as a desecrated object, and the visage of each of these iron statues is most fearsome and terrifying.

Moving a statue can be done, but it requires a combined Strength of 48. Moving the statue in the northwest corner reveals a ring pull in the western wall which will raise a small plug of stone and enable the party to enter a small chute which takes them into the corridor that goes west.

***Bronze Urn.*** A character who examines the urn can use an action to pry loose the stopper. If the stopper is removed, an **efreeti** will come forth. If the urn has been battered, knocked about, shaken, overturned, or otherwise roughly handled, the creature will be in a fury and will attack. If not, it will grant three wishes for the party and then depart.

***Sarcophagus.*** Examining the lid of the sarcophagus reveals that glyphs spelling "ACERERAK" are inset on it in platinum. (The metal, worth 100 pp in total, can be pried out.) The end of the thing nearest the wall is stove in and shattered. Inside can be seen bits of a wooden inner shell, a few bones, destroyed jewelry (the stones pried out), torn bits of robes and windings, dust, and a broken *staff of the magi* (evident from the runes upon it). A shattered skull will roll out if the contents are moved around. (Why, the demilich has long been destroyed, but his magical traps somehow survived!)

***Iron Chests.*** Each of these massive boxes is embedded into the stone. Neither can possibly be moved, and both show marks of prying, battering, and similar treatment. Each chest is triple-locked, and each lock contains a poison needle trap (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). If the trap is triggered by a failed check, it deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of purple worm poison (see "*Sample Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Treasure.*** Both chests have treasure, the true nature of which doesn't become apparent until the spoils are moved at least 13 miles away from the tomb.

The eastern chest holds 10,000 gems, which will initially appear to be of not less than 50 gp value each. Each is actually a 1 gp piece of quartz. The other chest contains 10,000 copper pieces magicked to appear as platinum when they are first discovered.

### 31. One-Way Doors

Characters who traverse the eastÃ¢ÂÂwest corridor have no chance of discovering the northÃ¢ÂÂsouth route that adjoins it. The two doors to the north are magical, such that they don't exist except for characters who approach and open them from the north.

***Phasing Pit.*** The covered pit depicted on the map doesn't exist until someone opens either of the one-way doors or opens the door in the corridor while traveling east to west. When one of those events occurs, the covered pit comes into phase where shown. This pit is otherwise exactly the same as others in the place.

### 32. Secret Door

The portal to the south can't be detected by any magical means, but a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check enables a character to notice that the wall at this location has a small opening that is metal-linedÃ¢ÂÂobviously a keyhole!

Following this discovery, any attempt to force the door open by physical or magical means will be useless. But if the *First Key* (from *area 19*) is inserted in the hole and then removed, the door will sink into the floor, revealing itself to be a stone-sheathed adamantine slab of tremendous thickness. There can be no real doubt that the end of the adventureÃ¢ÂÂone way or anotherÃ¢ÂÂis near.

### 33. The Crypt of Acererak the Demilich

>>Beyond the door is a smallish, rectangular chamber with a ceiling that extends twenty-five feet overhead. There is a small depression a few inches deep and about two feet square in the center of the floor.
>>

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check enables a character to discover a small hole in the middle of this depressionÃ¢ÂÂanother keyhole!

If the *First Key* is inserted herein, the key explodes, and the individual doing so takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage.

The *Second Key* (from *area 28*) will fit within the hole, and nothing untoward will occur. In fact, nothing whatsoever will happen until it is turned three times to the right in succession. If this is done, read:

>>As you finish turning the key, the floor begins to tremble, and then abruptly it starts to rise toward the ceiling.
>>

Roll initiative. On initiative count 10, anyone still on the southern 15 feet of the crypt floor is crushed against the roof and slain. If any characters survive, read:

>>The rising of the floor in the southern part of the room reveals a mithral vault. There is a door in the center of the device, with a ring set into it.
>>

A hard pull will open the door.

>>A low, dust-covered bench is near the back wall of the vault. On and around it are an abundance of items. Resting on one end of it is a human skull.
>>

![](img/adventure/TftYP-ToH/007-totyp-07-09.webp)

***Creature.*** The skull belongs to Acererak, the demilich who lies in wait for the characters. When they joined the halves of the First Key, that act called his soul back to the Material Plane, and their use of the Second Key to enter the vault alerted him that he must be prepared to do battle in order to survive yet more centuries.

All that now remains of Acererak the lich are the dust of his bones. This bit is enough! If any of the treasure in the crypt is touched, the dust swirls into the air and forms a man-like shape. If this shape is ignored, it will dissipate in 3 rounds, for it can only advance and threaten, not harm. Any physical attack will give it 1 point of energy, however, and a damaging spell cast on it gives it a number of points of energy equal to the level of the spell slot expended (1 point for a cantrip). Each point of energy is equivalent to a hit point, and if 50 hit points are thus gained, the dust will form into a **ghost** controlled by Acererak, and this thing will attack immediately. (The dust will seem to waver and fall back if it is struck by blow or spell, as if suffering actual damage, so formation of the ghost isn't too improbable.)

If any character is so foolish as to touch the skull of the demilich, a terrible thing occurs. Acererak rises into the air upon the touch, and it slowly scans the party prior to attacking. The **demilich** has the Trap the Soul action and access to its lair actions, but not lair traits. It can tell which members of the party are the most powerful, and it uses Trap the Soul on them first.

There are two jewels set into the skull's eye sockets (50,000 gp rubies) and six pointed (marquis cut) diamonds set as teeth in the jaw (each diamond is worth 5,000 gp). If all these gems are filled with souls and the skull is still intact and still being opposed, it will pronounce a curse upon the remaining characters which will teleport them randomly in a 300-mile radius, each subjected to a *bestow curse* spell (save DC 17) that lasts until dispelled. If the curse is removed, the character must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character must permanently decrease one ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1 each. This secondary effect is instantaneous and can't be dispelled.

#### Treasure

Characters who survive the demilich's wrath can claim any loot they can carry. Inside the vault are these items:

- All items possessed by characters who were teleported nude
- Ninety-seven small gems worth 10 gp each
- Three huge gemsÃ¢ÂÂa 10,000 gp peridot, a 50,000 gp emerald, and a 100,000 gp black opal
- Four magic weaponsÃ¢ÂÂa *defender*, a *sword of vengeance*, a *berserker axe*, and a *spear of backbiting* (see *appendix A*)

In addition, the hoard contains several magic items of your choosing (except that none can be of legendary rarity), including:

- Twelve potions
- Six *spell scrolls*, each of a wizard spell of 5th level or lower
- One magic ring, one magic rod, one magic staff, and three wondrous items

This ends the expedition to the *Tomb of Horrors*. We hope you and your players have found it exciting, challenging, and rewarding.
