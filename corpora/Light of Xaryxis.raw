# Introduction: Wildspace Awaits!

This Dungeons & Dragons adventure begins in a world of your choosing, then ventures into Wildspace and the Astral Sea. The characters navigate these environments aboard ships that can traverse vast distances by using a magical form of travel known as spelljamming. Before running this adventure, read the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*, which contains information about these settings and how spelljamming works. The adventure assumes the characters have no prior experience with spelljammingÃ¢ÂÂbut that is about to change!

The information in this book is for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now.

## Adventure Summary

This story revolves around the characters' efforts to save their home world from an attack by an empire of astral elves. The attack is underway when the adventure begins. After taking refuge aboard a spelljamming vessel, the characters head for the stars to discover who is responsible for the attack and how they can save their world.

During the adventure, the characters encounter many space-dwelling creatures, some of which become companions on the party's voyage. The characters also meet **Princess Xedalli**, an astral elf who is embroiled in a power struggle with her twin brother, **Prince Xeleth**, over who will rule the empire that currently threatens the characters' world. With or without Xedalli's help, the characters must assemble an unlikely alliance to strike at the heart of the astral elf empire.

The characters encounter many grandiose locations as the adventure unfolds, including an asteroid city known as the Rock of Bral and the imperial citadel of the astral elves, which orbits a star called Xaryxis.

### Xaryxis

The light of Xaryxis has nourished the Xaryxian Empire for millennia, serving as a wellspring for the magical power that the astral elves of Xaryxispace use to sustain their empire. A thousand years ago, the star's light began to fade, threatening the elves' prosperity, so Emperor Xavan turned the dying star into a parasite that leaches the life from worlds using crystal seeds harvested from the star.

After the elves select a suitable host world, ships known as star moths release hundreds of astral seeds into the planet's atmosphere. The seeds fall from the sky and bury themselves in the ground and the oceans of the world. After the astral seeds take root, they produce enormous crystalline vines. The tendrils of these vines extend deep into the world and draw life energy from it. Once the vines have sapped a world of its energy, a process that can take months, they send out a bright beam of light that travels back to Xaryxis, temporarily replenishing the star's radiance and leaving the host world a barren husk.

Although Xaryxis shines brilliantly after each replenishment, it isn't long before the light of Xaryxis begins to wane once more, presaging the doom of another world.

Once astral seeds have taken root on a host world, there is no easy way to stop the transformationÃ¢ÂÂthe vines are too thick and too numerous to be uprooted. Destroying the star Xaryxis, which acts as a lodestone for the astral seeds, is the only way to free a world from their grip. If the star goes dark, the crystal vines release their stored energy back into the host world, shrivel, and die.

### Adventure Structure

This adventure has four parts, each divided into three chapters. Each chapter is designed to be run as a single play experience lasting 2 to 3 hours, with the expectation that a group should be able to complete the adventure in twelve sessions of play.

Each chapter begins with an overview that gives you a sense of what is ahead for the heroes and recaps what has happened so far. There's no telling how a session will unfold, since the players have some control over the plot, but the text tries to give you enough information to run the various creatures and encounters. If the characters do something unexpected, improvise as best you can while gently steering them toward their main goal. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger to set the stage for the next session, assuming things go as planned.

The four parts of the adventure are as follows:

*Part 1: Seeds of Destruction* chronicles the devastation wrought by the astral seeds on the characters' home world and the party's escape into Wildspace. After fleeing to the Rock of Bral, the characters seek out **Commodore Krux**, a giff, hoping he can help them thwart the Xaryxian Empire's machinations and save the characters' world in the process.

*Part 2: Terrors of the Void* deals with the characters' journey to the edge of their Wildspace system, where they encounter **Princess Xedalli** and learn the enormity of the task that lies before them. The characters head for Doomspace, where Krux plans to join a coalition of those that oppose the Xaryxian Empire.

*Part 3: Chaos in Doomspace* begins with the party's arrival in Doomspace, where the coalition they had intended to join turns out to be a bunch of quarreling factions. They must find a way to unite the factions before attacking the Xaryxian Empire.

*Part 4: Saviors of the Multiverse* describes Xaryxispace and the characters' climactic encounter with **Prince Xeleth** and the armada under his command. Finally, the characters arrive at the imperial citadel, where they discover the true cost of saving their world and must decide the fate of Xaryxis and the Xaryxian Empire before making the long voyage home.

## Running the Adventure

![A Xaryxian star moth jettisons one of many astral seeds while orbiting an unsuspecting world](img/adventure/LoX/001-08-001.star-moth-splash.webp)

To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks (*Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*). In addition, you need the other two books included in this product: *Boo's Astral Menagerie* and the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*.

>>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>>

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, you better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." Usually, you can find the stat block in the *Monster Manual*; if the stat block is in *Boo's Astral Menagerie*, the adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*, while magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text directs you to the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*.

The *Astral Adventurer's Guide* describes the many types of *spelljamming vessels* mentioned in the adventure and includes deck plans for each one. At your discretion, you can provide the players with a copy of the deck plans for whatever ship they're sailing aboard and allow them to manage the ship's activity during encounters, freeing you to concentrate on running the nonplayer characters and their ships.

### Adventure Inspiration

*Light of Xaryxis* is inspired by the 1980 film *Flash Gordon* and serialized Flash Gordon comic strips from the 1930s. The adventure's heroes, like Flash Gordon himself, must defeat otherworldly foes to save their home planet. Campy supporting characters, implausible situations, and over-the-top dialogue help push the story toward its inevitable conclusion. Absurd plot twists undercut the sense of urgency, keeping the heroes on their toes as they stumble from one cliffhanger to the next.

![A space galleon flees a world in peril](img/adventure/LoX/002-08-002.space-galleon.webp)

Here are some things you can do to make *Light of Xaryxis* feel like the pulpy sci-fi tales that inspired it:

- Watch the 1980 *Flash Gordon* film. It's not Shakespeare or Scorsese, but the dialogue is quotable, and the costumes and sets are fantastic.
- Any nonplayer character who isn't fighting the heroes should naturally defer to the heroes, giving players the sense that their characters matter (no matter how puny and insignificant they might seem to their enemies).
- End each session with a cliffhanger. The adventure already has one at the end of each chapter, but you can create your own cliffhanger by ending a session with an unexpected threat, twist, or revelation.
- When you're ready to begin a new chapter, read or paraphrase the recap that appears at the start of the chapter, embellishing it with pertinent events or memorable quotes from earlier game sessions.

### Starting Characters

![{@creature Princess Xedalli|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/003-08-003.princess-xedalli.webp)

The adventure assumes that the characters start at 5th level. If your players have characters of lower level, they will need to go on some other adventures first to gain enough experience to advance to 5th level. Both the Dungeons & Dragons *Starter Set* and the Dungeons & Dragons *Essentials Kit* contain adventures that will take characters from 1st level to 5th level. Alternatively, you can simply ask your players to create new 5th-level characters, as described in the next section.

#### Character Creation

If spacefaring races are common on your world, you can add backgrounds and races from the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* to the list of character options that players can choose from when creating their characters. As the DM, you decide what is available to your players and what isn't.

If, during the adventure, a player wants to create a new character (perhaps because their previous one died or left the party), that player can roll up a new character of the same level as the rest of the adventuring party, choosing from the options available. If the party is in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, you can assume that all the character options from the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* are available.

To create 5th-level characters for this adventure, players can use the *character creation steps* outlined in the *Player's Handbook*. In addition to more hit points, class features, and spells, each character has normal starting equipment plus 625 gp to spend on additional nonmagical gear. If you're running a high magic campaign, each character also gains one uncommon magic item of the player's choice, subject to your approval.

### Character Advancement

At the end of each of the adventure's parts, everyone in the party receives enough experience points to advance 1 level so that they are at the level they should be for the next chapter, as shown in the Character Levels table. Characters who finish the adventure advance to 9th level.

##### Character Levels
| Part                           | Character Level |
|--------------------------------|:---------------:|
| *1: Seeds of Destruction*      |       5th       |
| *2: Terrors of the Void*       |       6th       |
| *3: Chaos in Doomspace*        |       7th       |
| *4: Saviors of the Multiverse* |       8th       |

### Where to Begin?

The adventure begins in a coastal city or port town on a world where the characters are either seeking their fortunes or resting between adventures. Since most of this adventure takes place in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, the initial setting doesn't have much effect on how the adventure will play out. The characters' home world serves mainly to set the stakes for the storyÃ¢ÂÂit's in danger of being destroyed!Ã¢ÂÂso using a world your players are familiar with works best, whether that is a published campaign setting or a world of your own creation.

If you used *Lost Mine of Phandelver* (the adventure in the Dungeons & Dragons *Starter Set*) or *Dragon of Icespire Peak* (the adventure in the Dungeons & Dragons *Essentials Kit*) to get the characters to 5th level, then *Light of Xaryxis* begins in the same region featured in those introductory adventures: the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms setting, on the world of Toril. The city of Neverwinter, one of several major ports along the Sword Coast, could easily be where the characters find themselves at the beginning of this adventure.

All the locations the characters visit in this adventure are described in this book, and further details about the *Rock of Bral* are provided in the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*.

> ##### Using the Starlight Apparition
>
>In addition to being a fascinating encounter in its own right, the **starlight apparition** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) can be a useful device for you if a key nonplayer character meets an unfortunate and unexpected end. If, later in the adventure, the characters need a piece of information only that nonplayer character would know, you can have the nonplayer character appear in the form of a starlight apparition to guide the characters.

# Part 1: Seeds of Destruction

![](img/adventure/LoX/004-09-001.part-one-splash.webp)

## Chapter 1: Astral Rain

As the adventure opens, the characters are going about their daily business in a bustling coastal settlement, where everyone is talking about the spectacular meteor showers that have blazed through the sky the past several nights. In fact, what folks have witnessed are showers of astral seeds falling from space and plunging deep into the ground and water in and around the settlement. Some of these seeds have now germinated. The adventure begins when enormous crystalline vines erupt from beneath the streets, throwing the community into chaos.

### Astral Blights

When you are ready to begin play, read:

>>Your adventures have taken you to a coastal community, where local fishing boats share the harbor with trade vessels from far and wide. Lately everyone has been discussing the deluge of falling stars that has lit up the evening sky for the past several nights. Some say these celestial events are omens of impending disaster. Others believe they are a precursor to the gods descending from the heavens to walk the land. No one knows for sure.
>>
>>You are just finishing your midday meal while listening to a blacksmith tell about being awakened last night by a loud crash. According to the smith, a crystalline vine burst out of the ground and punched a hole through the roof of his neighbor's bakery. "Must be divine punishment for the bad pies and steep prices," says the blacksmith with a nervous chuckle. Suddenly, the earth shakes violently beneath your feet. You hear the dull roar of a distant eruption. The smith and several others hurry outside. Joining them, you see a sinuous, crystalline vine erupting from the ground a few blocks awayÃ¢ÂÂtall enough to be seen above the rooftops. Screams of panic rise from the same direction.
>>
>>A sailor standing in your midst says, "I think it's time I returned to my ship. You're welcome to join me. You would be wise to flee as well." With that, she makes her way toward the docks.
>>
>>The ground churns again, and more eruptions burst through the streets all around you. From these sites sprout smaller crystalline vines that uproot themselves and begin lurching through the streets, driving panicked citizens before them, while the enormous vine in the distance stretches ever taller.
>>

The friendly sailor, **Elaina Sartell**, is described later in the chapter. She flees at once, leaving the characters to decide their own course of action.

The ambulatory vines are six **astral blights** (see the accompanying stat block). They focus their attacks on nearby commoners, ignoring the characters except for any who attack them. The blights' slow speed means the characters can evade them easily.

The characters have several choices for how to proceed:

- **Fight the Blights.** If the characters destroy all six blights, new ones appear; roll a d6 to determine how many. These new arrivals either burst up from the ground or shamble along streets and alleys, converging on the characters' location. Each time the characters defeat a group of blights, a new wave appears; repeat the die roll to see how many more blights arrive. With the appearance of each new wave, it should become increasingly obvious to the players that the characters can't eliminate all the blights and should consider a different course of action.
- **Head to the Docks.** If the characters heed **Elaina Sartell**'s advice and head to the docks, run the "Trouble at the Docks" encounter when they arrive.
- **Hole Up.** If the characters try to barricade themselves in a building or find somewhere else in the settlement to hide, the increasingly violent earth tremors cause their shelter to partially collapse, making it apparent that there's no safe refuge in the settlement. The characters will need to choose another option.
- **Investigate the Crystalline Vine.** If the characters make their way toward the enormous crystalline vine, see "Crystalline Vine" below.
- **Make for the Outskirts.** If the characters bolt through the streets and alleys toward the outskirts of the settlement, see "Danger in the Streets" below.

![{@creature Astral Blight|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/005-637961800673014558.webp)

### Crystalline Vine

The vine growing in the center of the settlement sprouted after an astral seed fell from the sky, crashed into the bakery, and buried itself in the ground. The vine is 50 feet wide at its base, rises 1,000 feet into the air, and is still growing. It is made of an iridescent mineral that is impervious to the characters' spells and weapons. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check determines that the substance is a type of living crystal.

No astral blights congregate near the crystalline vine, which means the characters can approach and study it without being attacked. The vine is warm to the touch and pulses with light. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that the vine's roots extend deep into the earth and are feeding on the planet's thermal energy. There appears to be no way to stop this process.

As it grows taller, the vine also grows wider, slowly pushing away the dirt and debris from around its base. Inform the players that the tremors seem to be getting stronger as the vine grows, leaving them with two options: flee for the docks (see "Trouble at the Docks" below) or flee for the outskirts (see "Danger in the Streets" below).

### Danger in the Streets

Astral blights roam the streets. Members of the local militia (use the **guard** stat block) try to hold the blights at bay long enough for unarmed civilians to flee the vicinity. If the characters stay in a single location for longer than 1 minute, 1d6 **astral blights** (see the accompanying stat block) converge on their location and attack them.

The following events occur as the characters move through streets and alleys toward the outskirts of the settlement, but not if they head straight to the docks:

- **Avalanche of Debris.** Tremors cause buildings close to the characters to collapse, catching them in an avalanche of debris. Each character must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Terrified Citizens.** A crowd of thirty commoners rushes past the characters, led by a scrappy youngster who shouts, "To the docks! We'll take one of the ships! It's our only hope!" An old woman grabs the arm of a character and moans, "Those vines are everywhere! There's nowhere safe! We're all doomed!" Suddenly, a tremor causes a building to collapse, burying half of the crowd and scattering what's left of it.

If the characters leave the settlement by land, they see dozens of gigantic crystalline vines sprouting across the countryside as hundreds of astral blights rove the fields. The tremors become full-blown earthquakes as the crystalline vines plunge their roots into the earth and reach hundreds of feet into the air. Characters who press on in this direction instead of heading back to the docks are eventually rescued (see "Emergency Airlift" below).

### Trouble at the Docks

When the characters arrive at the docks, read:

>>The scene at the docks is chaotic. Hundreds of people swarm the piers, trying to push their way onto three vessels that haven't yet set sail: two longships and a galleon. A group of thugs in black leather armor use their clubs on a crowd of screaming commoners, keeping the people away from the ships as they're loaded with cargo under the supervision of a sneering man with long red hair.
>>
>>A woman steps out of the crowd and wipes blood from her chin. "Glad to see you again," she says with a smile. "I'm Captain **Elaina Sartell**, and one of those ships is mine. Pity I can't reach it. Would you be good enough to help me? I promise to return the favor."
>>

Captain **Elaina Sartell**, a chaotic good **bandit captain**, commands the galleon *Moondancer*. She is unflappableÃ¢ÂÂan island of calm in a sea of chaos.

#### Traevus and His Gang

Captain Sartell identifies the red-haired man as a local crime lord named TraevusÃ¢ÂÂa neutral evil **veteran**. The ten **thugs** blocking her path work for him.

Traevus and his thugs are indifferent toward the party but turn hostile if the characters try to force their way onto the *Moondancer* with Captain Sartell in tow. Although Sartell knows Traevus, he doesn't recognize her.

Traevus is intent on saving himself and as much of his merchandise as possible. As an action, a character can try to convince him to take the party and Sartell on as crew, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

If Traevus learns that Sartell is the ship's captain, he orders his thugs to apprehend Sartell, hoping that capturing her will help keep the crew of the *Moondancer* in line. If he is challenged, or if he catches one or more characters trying to get aboard the *Moondancer*, Traevus attacks along with six of his thugs while the others continue to hold back the mob that has gathered at the docks. If Traevus is defeated, any remaining thugs in his employ lose their will to fight. Some are overrun by the mob, and the rest leap into the water and swim toward the two longships as they set sail.

Once the thugs are defeated, the *Moondancer* takes aboard the rest of the citizens gathered at the docksÃ¢ÂÂsixty souls in allÃ¢ÂÂbefore shoving off. See chapter 2 for more information about the *Moondancer* and its crew.

### Possible Endings

If the characters boarded the *Moondancer* at the docks, wrap up the session with "Up and Away." Otherwise, use "Emergency Airlift."

#### Up and Away

Once the characters and other passengers are safely aboard the *Moondancer*, read:

>>The crystalline vine coils upward, scraping the sky. From the harbor, you can see similar vines miles from the settlement, having burst out of the world and reaching skyward. As the *Moondancer* clears the harbor, Captain Sartell stamps her boot hard on the deck. "**Flapjack**!" she yells. "Take us up!"
>>
>>Suddenly, the galleon lists and creaks as it rises out of the water and into the air! The world falls away beneath you as the *Moondancer* flies through the clouds and into the starry abyss of night.
>>

#### Emergency Airlift

If the characters don't make it to the docks, Captain Sartell reveals her identity to Traevus and negotiates a deal with him whereby she takes command of the *Moondancer* in exchange for delivering Traevus, his gang, and their belongings to a safe port. As soon as they set sail, Sartell orders the ship to take flight and rescue the party. Traevus and his thugs are too stunned by this development to interfere.

Wherever the characters happen to be, Sartell finds them. Read:

>>A great shadow falls over you. You look up to see a mighty galleon floating in midair, its sails ruffling in the breeze. A rope ladder tumbles down from the ship's side to hang mere feet above the ground, and a face appears over the side of the railing.
>>
>>"Need a lift?" asks the sailor you met earlier.
>>

*Here ends chapter 1.*

## Chapter 2: Attack of the Star Moth

>>*Driven from a coastal settlement by gigantic crystalline vines, astral blights, and earthquakes, the characters secured passage aboard the* Moondancer, *a galleon under the command of Captain Elaina Sartell. The ship then rocketed into space*!
>>

![Captain {@creature Elaina Sartell|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/006-09-002.captain-elaina-sartell.webp)

As the *Moondancer* leaves the planet's atmosphere and enters Wildspace, Captain Sartell sets a course for the Rock of Bral. Now is the time for you to determine where the Rock of Bral is situated relative to the characters' home world. Once you've determined the Rock of Bral's location in Wildspace, estimate how many days it will take the *Moondancer* to get there. If the adventure began on Toril, the Rock of Bral is one of several asteroids orbiting the planet, and getting there takes only a few hours. Otherwise, assume the Rock orbits another world or is situated in a nearby asteroid belt and requires several days to reach.

In this chapter, the *Moondancer* is intercepted by an astral elf vessel shortly after leaving the characters' world, but the characters have time to finish a short rest before the enemy ship arrives.

Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with *chapter 2* of the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*. Keep the deck plans for the space galleon and the star moth handy, because they will come into play.

### Aboard the Moondancer

As the *Moondancer* leaves the characters' world behind, read:

>>Standing on the deck of the *Moondancer*, you see scores of crystalline vines erupting from the surface of your world, some of the vines reaching high enough to break through the clouds. You find yourself sailing through a void filled with colorful gases and blinking stars. A school of space-dwelling fish swims past the ship on the starboard side.
>>
>>"Welcome to Wildspace," says Captain Sartell, sweeping her arms wide. "That was a close thing, down there. Blast if I know what those vines are or how to get rid of them, but somebody on the Rock of Bral might."
>>

Only two members of the *Moondancer*'s crew are aboard: Captain Sartell and a spelljamming flumph (see "Flapjack the Flumph" below). Depending on how events played out in chapter 1, the *Moondancer* might have the following passengers on board, in addition to the characters:

- Traevus and his thugs (neither Traevus nor his thugs will take orders from Captain Sartell, instead keeping to themselves as long as the characters are around to thwart any open revolt)
- Up to sixty **commoners** (six of whom are competent sailors)

The *Moondancer* is armed with two ballistae but has no crew to operate them. Its mangonel was destroyed in a recent engagement, and Captain Sartell hasn't replaced it yet. Getting a new mangonel was the main reason Sartell was on the party's home world, since wood is much easier to find there than at her usual port of call, the Rock of Bral.

#### Captain Elaina Sartell

Captain Sartell operates out of the Rock of Bral as a privateer under the commission of the city's ruler, Prince Andru. She assures the characters that they'll be safe there.

![{@creature Flapjack|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/007-09-003.flapjack.webp)

Once her ship docks at the Rock of Bral, Captain Sartell plans to offload the characters and the ship's other passengers. This act marks the extent of her willingness to help the characters.

#### Flapjack the Flumph

One crew member stayed aboard the *Moondancer* while it was in port: a **flumph** named **Flapjack**, who serves as the ship's spelljammer. **Flapjack** has the following additional action option:

>>***Spellcasting.*** The flumph casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

>>At will: *mage hand*, *minor illusion*

>>1/day each: *magic missile*, *unseen servant*

#### Features of the Moondancer

![Moondancer Deck Plans](img/adventure/LoX/008-map-2.11-space-galleon.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/009-map-2.11-space-galleon-player.webp)Use the space galleon deck plans in the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* to represent the *Moondancer*. Noteworthy features are described below:

***Area 3:.*** Captain's Quarters. Among Captain Sartell's possessions is a locked treasure chest, which she keeps in her cabin. Captain Sartell carries the only key to the chest. As an action, a character can pick the lock by making a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or break open the chest with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The chest contains three bottles of fine wine (10 gp each), six gold bracelets (25 gp each), nine pearls (100 gp each) in a velvet pouch, and a *spell scroll* of *air bubble* (see the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*).

***Area 5:.*** Spelljamming Helm. The ship's *spelljamming helm* looks like a floating, ornate silver chair with a purple seat cushion and no legs. Glowing blue crystals underneath the seat project a magic circle onto the floor, stabilizing the chair. **Flapjack the flumph** sits in the chair while piloting the ship.

***Area 12:.*** Upper Cargo Hold. The upper cargo hold contains a dozen healthy *mules* (which Sartell plans to sell as beasts of burden); sacks of food for the animals; and material placed here by Traevus and his gang (see chapter 1), which consists of twenty 40-pound crates of assorted martial weapons (2,000 gp total value) and five hundred bottles of brandy (3 gp each).

***Area 13:.*** Lower Cargo Hold. The lower cargo hold contains crates of foodstuffs and casks of fresh water, enough to last ten Medium creatures for thirty days.

### When Elves Attack

The characters have time to take a short rest before trouble catches up to them and Captain Sartell presses them into service. At the end of the characters' short rest, read:

>>The ship slows as another vessel comes into view, approaching the *Moondancer* from astern. The pursuing vessel looks like a giant moth with wings made of iridescent crystal, similar in color and luster to the crystalline vines that ravaged your world. You can just make out figures on the other vessel's deck scrambling to arm the ship's mangonel.
>>
>>"Astral elves," curses Captain Sartell, "and they don't look friendly. Best ready yourselves for a fight."
>>

The astral elf vessel is a star moth called the *Dark Star*. It is crewed by three **astral elf warriors**Ã¢ÂÂCaptain Azmadian (lawful evil), Lieutenant Jalin (lawful evil), and Lieutenant Zanth (lawful neutral)Ã¢ÂÂas well as a neutral evil **astral elf star priest** named Altura (the ship's spelljammer), and nine **plasmoid explorers** of various alignments.

![The Dark Star](img/adventure/LoX/010-09-004.the-dark-star.webp)

#### Ship-to-Ship Battle

See chapter 2 of the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* for rules on ship-to-ship engagements.

Captain Sartell grimly informs the characters that the star moth is the faster ship and that the *Moondancer* has no hope of outrunning it. She estimates the characters have about a minute to prepare before the star moth gets close enough to use its mangonel (at long range). Once that happens, Sartell orders her ship to turn about and close with the astral elves as quickly as possible to minimize the *Dark Star*'s opportunity to fire on the *Moondancer*. It then takes another minute for the two ships to come within boarding distance.

#### Dealing with the Dark Star

Once the ships are close enough, the three **astral elf warriors** board the *Moondancer*, their faces hidden behind visors, and haughtily demand Captain Sartell's surrender. She politely declines, prompting the astral elves to attack while the plasmoids use the *Dark Star*'s ballistae to fire on characters they can see. Captain Sartell fights alongside the characters, but Traevus and his thugs, if they are aboard, come to the *Moondancer*'s defense only if it looks like the characters are about to lose.

The astral elves are confident they can conquer the *Moondancer*, but if two of the warriors fall, the third tries to retreat to the *Dark Star*. After that attempt succeeds or fails, the star moth beats a hasty retreat. The star priest, Altura, remains aboard the *Dark Star* and uses a *sending* spell to relay what has happened to Helix, an astral elf on the Rock of Bral (see chapter 4). The plasmoids, meanwhile, are not great fighters and either flee or surrender if the characters engage them in melee.

#### Questioning the Astral Elves

Characters who capture and interrogate one or more of the astral elves can learn the following information:

- The astral elves, by order of Emperor Xavan of the Xaryxian Empire, are responsible for dropping astral seeds on the party's home world.
- The leader of the astral elf forces in this Wildspace system is Commander Vael. Most of Commander Vael's fleet has already begun sailing back to Xaryxispace. The *Dark Star* was left behind to monitor the astral seeds' progress.
- The vines and astral blights will feed on the planet's energy and that of its flora and fauna until the party's home world is a dead husk, a process that takes several months. The energy then will be transmitted in a single, enormous burst of light back to the astral elves' home system to be absorbed by their star, Xaryxis.
- Once the astral seeds have begun their work, there is no way to stop the process. (This isn't true, but the crew of the *Dark Star* believes it is. The characters won't discover the truth of this matter until later in the adventure.)

#### Questioning the Plasmoids

The plasmoids are mercenaries and have no insight into the astral elves' motives or plans. Even so, they can provide the characters with the following pieces of information:

- The *Dark Star*'s cargo hold was packed with at least a hundred astral seeds, which were jettisoned one by one into the atmosphere of the party's home world. (The plasmoids don't know what the astral seeds do, but they know that each one resembles a crystal pod roughly the size and shape of a coffin.)
- The astral elves hail from a faraway Wildspace system called Xaryxispace.
- The *Dark Star* was one of several astral elf ships that traveled to the party's home world. The rest of the fleet has already departed.

The plasmoids are willing to serve aboard the *Moondancer* if they are treated fairly. If she survives the battle, Captain Sartell puts the plasmoids to work, though she keeps them under close supervision.

#### Prisoners of the Astral Elves

If the characters are defeated, the astral elves allow dying characters to be stabilized. The astral elves assume control of the *Moondancer* while keeping Captain Sartell hostage aboard the *Dark Star* to ensure **Flapjack**'s compliance. The astral elf and plasmoid crew members are split between the two ships. The astral elves then start heading for the edge of the Wildspace system to rendezvous with the rest of Vael's fleet. En route, the two ships might encounter the derelict nautiloid, neogi raiders, or the Rock of Bral navy (all described in chapters 3 and 4), providing the characters with opportunities to escape.

#### Treasure

The *Dark Star* is a fine treasure; however, surviving plasmoid crew members recommend abandoning it, knowing that the astral elves will rain vengeance upon anyone in control of one of their ships. Its *spelljamming helm* is a more easily usable prize. It looks like a legless, high-backed chair made of wood, with crystal wings and armrests. Luminous crystals under the seat project a golden hexagon onto the floor; this hexagon stabilizes the helm, allowing it to swivel while holding it in place.

The *Dark Star*'s cargo hold contains enough food and water to sustain the ship's crew for twenty days.

### Traevus Takes Over

If the astral elves are defeated and Traevus and his thugs are alive and aboard the *Moondancer*, Traevus (neutral evil **veteran**) tries to take the galleon by force before the characters have a chance to finish a short rest.

### To the Rock of Bral

Assuming the characters repel the astral elves, the *Moondancer* resumes its journey to the Rock of Bral. Even if the characters didn't interrogate the astral elves, Captain Sartell has a hunch that the astral elves have something to do with the calamity befalling the party's home planet and says as much. She also mentions knowing someone on the Rock of Bral who might be willing to help the party. If the characters inquire further, Sartell informs them the contact is a giff named **Commodore Krux**, but she can't tell them more than that since she knows Krux only by reputation.

Enough time passes for the characters to take a long rest. When they're not resting, the characters are assigned miscellaneous chores.

During the voyage, the characters are free to ask Sartell or **Flapjack** more about Wildspace, the Rock of Bral, or the duo's previous adventures. Captain Sartell enjoys telling of her encounters with various Wildspace creatures (among them a friendly solar dragon and some not-so-friendly **space clowns**), while **Flapjack** explains the subtleties of astral navigation. If the party has any spellcasters, **Flapjack** takes this opportunity to instruct them in the rudiments of spelljamming.

### Mind Flayers?

When the characters are hours away from arriving at the Rock of Bral, read:

>>The ship slows unexpectedly. Around you, on all sides, colossal chunks of rock float in the void. Some of them are overgrown with vegetation, while others are bare stone. Creatures resembling jellyfish and rays glide through the spaces between them.
>>
>>Captain Sartell looks about uneasily. "Hmm. Plenty of places for pirates to hide."
>>
>>As if on cue, a vessel lurking behind a nearby asteroid comes into view. Its enormous spiral shell merges with an open bow, beneath which long tentacles wave as if caught in an invisible current.
>>
>>Sartell sucks her breath in through her teeth and whispers her next words: "Mind flayers."
>>

*Here ends chapter 2.*

## Chapter 3: Treacherous Salvage

>>*The characters escaped their endangered world with the help of Captain Sartell and her ship, the* Moondancer, *and ran afoul of an astral elf ship called a star moth. After surviving their first Wildspace encounter, the characters resumed their voyage to the Rock of Bral. Along the way, they made a terrifying discovery: a mind flayer ship lurking among some asteroids*!
>>

What at first appeared to be a dangerous mind flayer ship turns out to be a derelict vessel. Closer investigation turns up a single member of a pirate crew. In fact, this "survivor" is a **psurlon ringer**, a horrific predator disguised as a human.

![Wreck of the Lucent Edict](img/adventure/LoX/011-09-005.wreck-lucent-edict.webp)

### The Lucent Edict

The vessel is the *Lucent Edict*, a nautiloid. After the characters sight the craft, read:

>>As the nautilus-shaped vessel drifts closer, Captain Sartell lets out a sigh of relief. "It's a derelict," she says, pointing out its stripped weaponry and broken hull. "If there were mind flayers aboard, they would've attacked us by now. Looks like somebody's already picked it over. Still, there might be something left worth salvaging."
>>

The sensory input provided by the *Moondancer*'s *spelljamming helm* interfaces in a special way with **Flapjack**'s Advanced Telepathy, enabling the flumph to sense the presence of telepathic activity on nearby vessels and making the flumph a sort of early warning system in advance of encounters with mind flayers and their ilk. The nautiloid makes **Flapjack** uneasy, a feeling that stems from the presence of psurlons on board it. At the same time, the **psurlons'** Aberrant Mind trait confounds the **flumph's** Advanced Telepathy. **Flapjack** has the vague sense that something is aboard the derelict vessel but can't say what. He shares this information with Sartell and any characters with whom he has forged a close bond.

Captain Sartell orders **Flapjack** to bring her ship alongside the vessel while she designates the characters as a boarding party, instructing them to kill any hostile creatures they encounter.

If the characters balk at exploring the nautiloid, Captain Sartell sarcastically apologizes for interrupting their "pleasure cruise" and wonders aloud whether they'd rather stay back and swab the decks while she does all the hard work. If the characters still refuse, Captain Sartell makes good on her threat and boards the vessel herself in search of salvage. When she doesn't return, **Flapjack** urges the party to go and find her, refusing to leave the nautiloid behind until they do so.

#### Benoto Kralazar

Whether or not the characters consent to Captain Sartell's plan, they soon see a young human in ragged, bloodstained clothes step out onto the nautiloid's battle prow. He waves his arms to get their attention and seems to be in distress. If one or more characters enter the nautiloid's air envelope, he introduces himself as Benoto Kralazar and explains that his ship (the nautiloid) was attacked by neogi. He informs the characters that most of his crew are dead, but there are still a few survivors aboard in need of healing, and he begs the party's help.

Benoto is a **psurlon ringer** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), a descendant of a group of psurlons that traveled with the *Lucent Edict*'s original mind flayer crew. The mind flayers were attacked and wiped out by githyanki, who disabled the nautiloid and left it adrift. Human pirates found the wreck and tried to plunder it, unaware that the psurlons left behind a hidden clutch of eggs. After hatching from their eggs, the juvenile psurlons began preying on the pirates, killing several of them and forcing the rest to flee. One of the psurlons then assumed the form of a pirate named Benoto Kralazar and has since been using the disguise to lure other victims onto the *Lucent Edict*.

If the characters board the *Lucent Edict*, Benoto shows them around the ship while he spins a tale about his crew's harrowing encounter with a group of neogi. The tale is not entirely fancifulÃ¢ÂÂa band of neogi did recently board the *Lucent Edict* in search of salvage, but they retreated once they realized the nautiloid was home to a bunch of psurlons.

#### Exploring the Lucent Edict

Use the nautiloid deck plans in chapter 2 of the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* to represent the *Lucent Edict*. The ship shows signs of battle damage and has 220 hit points remaining.

The nautiloid is also missing its *spelljamming helm* and its ballistae, and its mangonel is broken.

![Nautiloid Deck Plans](img/adventure/LoX/012-map-2.07-nautiloid.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/013-map-2.07-nautiloid-player.webp)The *Lucent Edict* has the following features:

- **Illumination.** All areas in the ship are dimly lit by flickering, bioluminescent orbs mounted to the walls or hanging from the ceiling. Removing an orb from its socket causes the orb to go dark.
- **Interior Doors.** Each interior door is a fleshy barrier that opens when a creature that has telepathy approaches within 5 feet of it, then quickly closes after the creature and its companions have moved through it. A door must otherwise be pried or tickled open, which requires an action.

The following locations are depicted on the nautiloid deck plans. Locations that are not described below are assumed to contain nothing of interest.

#### 1: Captain's Chair

>>An impressive chair is posed at the end of a catwalk so its occupant can look down onto the bridge floor. Green, glowing maggots crawl over the chair's current occupant: a headless mind flayer corpse.
>>

A githyanki knight beheaded the nautiloid's captain and took the head as a trophy, leaving the rest of the corpse slumped in the chair.

Any character who disturbs the headless corpse causes the green, glowing maggots covering it to become a hostile **swarm of insects**.

***Treasure.*** A character who examines the captain's chair and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a secret compartment in the left armrest. This compartment contains a black metal tube containing a *spell scroll* of *wall of force*.

#### 3: Spelljamming Helm

>>Lying on the floor of this raised platform is the headless body of a mind flayer. The stench of the rotting corpse is unpleasant, to say the least. The dead mind flayer lies in an otherwise open space where you imagine the ship's helm used to be.
>>

The githyanki who attacked the nautiloid disabled the craft by removing its *spelljamming helm*. They took the head of the dead mind flayer as a trophy.

***Treasure.*** Lying on the deck near the dead mind flayer is an *Ioun stone (reserve)*. The stone currently holds a single casting of the *shield* spell.

#### 4: Bridge Floor

![](img/adventure/LoX/014-09-006.nehthalggu-splash.webp)

>>The nautiloid's bridge has a high ceiling. Stairs ascend to a forward observation deck, and toward the stern a ladder climbs to the top of a balcony.
>>

Four **psurlons** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) hide in the shadows under the two flights of stairs that climb to the observation platform (area 2). These psurlons attack to kill. If Benoto is present, he helps his fellow psurlons.

#### 6: Observation Platform

>>The splintered remains of a mangonel lie on this forward deck, strewn around piles of ammunition.
>>

Amid several stacks of ballista bolts are a few clusters of mangonel stones. If the characters are interested in salvaging this ammunition, assume there are forty of each kind.

#### 10: Mess Hall

>>The door to this forward compartment has been fastened shut with sutures made of ropes and steel hooks.
>>

A character can cut through the sutures with a suitable tool and 1 minute of effort, after which the door can be opened normally.

The mess hall contains a **neh-thalggu** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) that currently has eight brains. The neh-thalggu, kept as a pet by the mind flayers, evaded the githyanki by using its *invisibility* spell, but it was later trapped here by the human pirates after it killed one of their number.

If a character approaches within 10 feet of the sutured door, the neh-thalggu calls out for help in Common, begging to be freed. It pretends to be a human pirate named Jaspar Graves and claims to have been trapped here by the aberrations that murdered the rest of the crew. (The neh-thalggu knows that psurlons have killed the other pirates and warns the characters about this if they haven't already discovered it for themselves.) If the characters ask Benoto about the neh-thalggu's story, he dismisses it as a fabrication, explaining that "Jaspar" is a brain-devouring aberration and that the characters shouldn't trust a word it says, nor should they free it.

#### 14: Cargo Hold

>>This cargo hold looks and smells like a slaughterhouse. Bodies lie strewn about the deck, and the floor is stained with blood. Most of the bodies appear to be human, but one is an arachnid form with an eel-like neck and head that lies as motionless as the others.
>>

If the characters follow Benoto here, he tries to split the party at this point. He invites one or two characters to accompany him to area 4 (where the other psurlons lie in wait) while suggesting that the remaining characters stay behind and search the cargo hold.

***Corpses.*** The cargo hold contains eleven human corpses. The arachnid form is a dead *neogi* (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*). A character who examines the corpses and makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers that all the bodies have circular bite marks on them, including the neogi. Although several scimitars and crossbows are scattered about the room, the corpses show no evidence of having been struck by them.

The bodies are in varying states of decay. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check, a character can determine that the neogi died within the last 24 hours, and that the freshest human corpses are at least three days old.

***Supplies.*** In addition to the corpses, the cargo hold has enough food and water stored in crates and casks to nourish ten Medium creatures for five days, as well several barrels of pickled brains floating in brine (food for the mind flayers).

***Treasure.*** A search of the human corpses in the cargo hold turns up a total of 23 gp and 117 sp in loose change and a bloodstone ring (50 gp).

#### 17: Cellblock

>>The rotting corpse of a headless mind flayer lies amid the hacked-up corpses of three hulking creatures with blood-spattered white fur. The condition of the corpses suggests that something or someone has been feeding on them.
>>

Githyanki warriors slew a mind flayer and its three quaggoth thralls, then claimed the illithid's head as a trophy. The corpses are slowly being consumed by the quaggoth in area 19, who survived the githyanki attack by hiding. Characters who take the time to search the bodies find something of value (see "Treasure" below).

The cells used to contain nine prisoners. The githyanki liberated their kin and put the other prisoners out of their misery. Characters who search the cells find the remains of three humans, a dwarf, a hadozee, and a plasmoid.

***Treasure.*** The beheaded mind flayer wears a *+1 breastplate* embossed with tentacles.

#### 19: Storage

>>A terrible stench fills this compartment, but the flickering lights can't reveal its source. You do, however, hear heavy breathing.
>>

A **quaggoth** hides around the corner on the starboard side of the compartment, out of view of the doorway. Fearing capture, it attacks any creature that enters the compartment.

***Stench.*** Once the quaggoth is dealt with, the characters can track down the source of the terrible stench: the putrescent, mostly eaten corpses of five psurlons hidden under a staircase that climbs to the battle deck. Within these foul remains are dozens of gelatinous, marble-sized egg casings left behind by the psurlon worms that hatched from the eggs.

### Neogi Raiders

The neogi raiders that made an abortive salvage attempt on the *Lucent Edict* didn't go far. Reasoning that other ships might be attracted to the drifting derelict, the neogi piloted their craft into a cluster of nearby asteroids and waited.

The neogi watch the *Moondancer*'s approach with interest, waiting to see if the characters board the nautiloid. Once the characters leave the *Lucent Edict* and return to their ship, the neogi spring their trap:

>>Just as you are making ready to leave, a dark shape glides across the face of a nearby asteroid. It is another ship. The new arrival resembles a giant spider, complete with long, delicate legs and weblike rigging. Starlight gleams off its metallic hull as it creeps silently toward your vessel.
>>
>>"A nightspider!" shouts Captain Sartell. "The neogi were using this hulk as bait, and we've flown right into their web!"
>>

*Here ends part 1 of the adventure. Each character should gain a level before the next session.*

------

# Part 2: Terrors of the Void

![](img/adventure/LoX/015-10-001.part-two-splash.webp)

## Chapter 4: A Friend Indeed

>>*En route to the Rock of Bral, the characters discovered a derelict nautiloid drifting in an asteroid field. Only too late did they realize that another, more dangerous ship was lurking nearby, waiting to spring its trap*!
>>

A nightspider crewed by neogi has made its presence known, but the characters aren't forced to deal with any new problems. The timely arrival of a naval patrol drives off the neogi raiders, after which the patrol sees the party safely to the Rock of Bral. There, the characters part ways with Captain Sartell, who encourages them to seek out a giff insurgent named **Commodore Krux**. The giff brings the characters to his spelljamming vessel, the *Second Wind*. They set out into Wildspace pursued by **Hastain**, a deadly ally of the Xaryxian Empire.

Before running this session, familiarize yourself with the Rock of Bral, which is described in *chapter 3* of the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*. When the characters finally arrive at the Rock, you can show players the *poster map* of the asteroid city.

### Nightspider Dead Ahead

The neogi ship bearing down on the *Moondancer* at the end of chapter 3 is a nightspider called the *Ebonsnare*. See chapter 2 of the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* for more information on nightspiders.

The *Ebonsnare* is crewed by eight **neogi pirates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) and twenty **commoners** of various races and alignments, whom the neogi have enslaved. The neogi also keep two **umber hulks** on board for use as shock troops during their raids. The nightspider is 250 feet away from the *Moondancer* when the characters spot it.

The characters likely have little chance of repelling the neogi boarding party, especially if they have just fought off the psurlons hiding aboard the derelict nautiloid in chapter 3. Luckily, a patrol from the Rock of Bral happens upon the characters just in time to save them from having to fight the neogi. Alternatively, if the characters avoided encountering the psurlons or seem eager to test their mettle against the nightspider's crew, allow a group of four **neogi pirates** and one **umber hulk** to board the *Moondancer*, then have the patrol arrive at a suitably dramatic moment during the fight.

#### To the Rescue!

As the nightspider approaches the *Moondancer* (or after a few rounds of battle, if you decide to allow the characters and the neogi to clash), read:

>>Suddenly, two galleons glide into view and begin pummeling the nightspider with ballista bolts and mangonel stones, forcing it to break off its attack and make for the cover of the asteroids.
>>

The newly arrived space galleons are the *Stalwart* and the *Incorrigible*, both under the command of a lawful neutral **githyanki buccaneer** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) named Daar'vik. The *Stalwart*'s crew consists of eighteen **bandits** of various races and alignments. The crew of the *Incorrigible* consists of eighteen **hadozee shipmates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) of various alignments. The spelljammer aboard each ship is a lawful neutral, human **mage**.

Commander Daar'vik, aboard the *Incorrigible*, is familiar with both the *Moondancer* and its captain, whom he considers little better than a pirate, though the githyanki grudgingly respects **Elaina Sartell**'s commission. His ship pulls up alongside the *Moondancer* so that Daar'vik can hail Captain Sartell and ask where the *Moondancer* is headed. She tells him that the *Moondancer* is going to the Rock of Bral, and Daar'vik offers to provide an escortÃ¢ÂÂan offer Sartell readily accepts in the wake of the nightspider's ambush.

If the *Moondancer* appears to be under the control of someone other than Captain Sartell (such as Traevus, the astral elves, or the characters), Daar'vik is suspicious and insists on escorting the ship back to the Rock of Bral, where he has it impounded until the question of its ownership can be resolved. Whether or not the characters allow him to do this is up to them.

If Captain Sartell is compelled to refuse Daar'vik's offer of escort (perhaps because someone is holding her ship hostage or using magic to control her behavior), the githyanki commander wishes her safe travels and sets his ships in pursuit of the nightspider.

### Welcome to the Rock

When the characters arrive at the Rock of Bral, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:

>>Sunlight illuminates the rooftops and spires of a city built across the top of a gigantic asteroid. The asteroid's underside has structures as well, including fortresses and giant sails. Wooden docks protrude from one end of the asteroid, and a variety of ships are moored there. Space-dwelling fish scatter in front of you as your ship adjusts its heading until the docks are straight ahead and level with the ship's main deck. Pier workers stand ready to catch ropes and tie off the ship as it glides alongside one of the docks and slows to a stop.
>>
>>"Welcome to the Rock!" says Captain Sartell. "This is where we part ways."
>>

If she hasn't done so already, Captain Sartell urges the characters to seek out **Commodore Krux**, a giff who has clashed with astral elves in the past and who might be able to help the characters plan their next move. Sartell knows that Krux can usually be found at the Happy Beholder, a popular tavern.

The characters are free to explore the city. If the party puts off meeting Krux for too long, move the story forward by having Captain Sartell send them a message that astral elves are searching for them, and they need to get off the Rock fast.

### Commodore Krux

Characters who venture to the Happy Beholder can find **Commodore Krux** there, day or night, nursing a hefty flagon of ale. When the characters enter the tavern, read:

>>A large, spherical creature with eyestalks and a watchful central eye tends bar in this establishment. Filling one side of a table meant for six is a broad-chested, hippo-headed man with a green parrot perched on one shoulder. The haggard figure squints at you over the top of an enormous tankard, then waves invitingly to the seats across from him.
>>

![{@creature Commodore Krux|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/016-10-002.commodore-krux.webp)

Krux is a lawful good **giff shipmate** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), a soldier who believes his glory days are behind him. Krux has spent the last few years working as a mercenary on and around the Rock of Bral, but lately the giff has been spending more time in his cups as new jobs have become fewer and farther between. The parrot perched on Krux's shoulder isn't his; the bird belongs to Large Luigi, the tavern's **beholder** proprietor. Luigi uses the parrot to help cheer up downtrodden patrons.

Krux's demeanor brightens if the characters mention what's happening to their home world or start to describe their encounter with the astral elves in chapter 2. The giff leans forward intently, shoves his tankard to the side, and implores the characters to tell him everything. Krux grows visibly excited as he listens to the party's tale; by the end of it, he is willing to aid the characters in their effort to save their world from what he calls the Xaryxian Empire, based on similar attacks he has heard about occurring on other worlds.

Krux is tight-lipped regarding his own history with the Xaryxian Empire as well as how he plans to help the characters, indicating that it is best not to say too much where others might overhear:

>>"A fleet of astral elf ships visited the Rock of Bral a few days before launching the attack on your world. The elves gave fair warning to various captains on the Rock, urging them to steer clear of your world lest their ships be fired upon. The elves undoubtedly left spies behind to make sure their warnings were heeded. Best we continue this chat aboard my ship."
>>

On the way to Krux's ship, the characters are accosted by four lawful evil **astral elf warriors** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) wearing cloaks and visors to conceal their identities. These elves (named Faarfryn, Helix, Kekarion, and Lannis) seek to avenge the defeat of Captain Azmadian and the *Dark Star* by killing the characters in the streets. Gadaric Main, the proconsul to Prince Andru of Bral, has given these emissaries diplomatic immunity. As a result, there's no one to stand in the elves' way. If he is present, Krux fights alongside the characters but is poisoned for the duration of the fight, due to his drunkenness.

If the characters are in danger of being defeated by the astral elves, a dozen **commoners** begin throwing stones and food at the astral elves. A few brazen locals even start attacking the elves with sticks and clubs. Realizing they're outnumbered, the elves withdraw while threatening to finish off the characters later.

### The Second Wind

Krux hurriedly ushers the party toward the docks in hopes of making a quick getaway aboard his ship. As the characters make their way to the Rock of Bral's docks with Krux at their side, read:

>>Stately galleons, sleek cutters that resemble flying fish, and warships built to look like hammerhead sharks line the docks of Bral. Krux waves his arm toward a craft that seems modest by comparison.
>>
>>The ship's sails are patchworks of mended canvas, while its hull seems barely held together by thick vines that bind it like rope. Its strangest feature is the full-grown tree that sprouts from the aft deck.
>>
>>"The *Second Wind*," Krux declares pridefully. "Isn't she something?"
>>

The *Second Wind* is a living ship equipped with two jolly boats called *Little Boom* and *Big Bluster* (see the "Jolly Boats" sidebar). See chapter 2 of the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* for the living ship's deck plans and weaponry.

![Living Ship Deck Plans](img/adventure/LoX/017-map-2.06-living.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/018-map-2.06-living-player.webp)The living ship's *spelljamming helm*, located belowdecks, looks like an antique chair with golden upholstery and arms sculpted to look like smiling dolphins. The right arm is loose and falls off easily (which has no effect on the item's functionality), and the chair reeks of stale ale. The chair is held aloft and stabilized by green crystals under the seat that project a magical green circle onto the floor.

As Krux and the characters board the vessel, they are accosted by its current captain, **Fel Ardra**, a chaotic neutral, tiefling **cult fanatic** who has been renting use of the ship from Krux. Fel is irate at Krux because she still has forty days left on her lease, and the tiefling is preparing to undertake a big job when the party arrives.

> ##### Jolly Boats
>
>A spelljamming ship can be outfitted with one or more jolly boats, which use the rowboat statistics in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. In space, jolly boats are used to cross the gulf between two ships whose gravity planes and air envelopes intersect (on occasions when bringing the bigger ships alongside each other would be risky), or to travel to or from a pier that is either too small or too crowded to accommodate a larger vessel.
>
>A jolly boat can be lowered into the gravity plane of a larger ship or object, where it bobs like a boat in water. A jolly boat is too small to support a *spelljamming helm*, so the crew must use oars to steer and propel it as it "floats" in the gravity plane. A jolly boat without a gravity plane to float in becomes uncontrollable, though its own air envelope has enough air to sustain one crew member for 8 hours or four crew members for 2 hours each.
>

#### Fel Ardra

**Fel Ardra** is a capable spelljammer who, under different circumstances, could make a comfortable living selling her services to other captains. As it happens, though, the tiefling has turned to smuggling to make enough coin to buy her way out of an infernal contract she entered into many years ago.

![{@creature Fel Ardra|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/019-10-003.fel-ardra.webp)

Although Krux doesn't approve of Fel's line of business, the giff has had a soft spot for her ever since the two met. Fel sees their relationship as purely transactional, but Krux is convinced the tiefling has a heart of gold, and he keeps trying to persuade her to give up smuggling. Now, with the party's arrival, Krux envisions the makings of a grand adventure, one he hopes that he and the characters can convince Fel to join.

For her part, Fel is indifferent to the party's plight and says that if Krux wants his ship back ahead of time, he'll have to refund the rest of her lease payment, which amounts to 400 gp. Krux says he is prepared to pay her back. Fel, however, can sense the giff's desperation, so she insists on also being compensated for the lost revenue of her next venture, which she figures to be 3,000 gp. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check realizes Fel is bluffingÃ¢ÂÂthe tiefling secretly reckons she would be lucky to clear 1,000 gpÃ¢ÂÂbut she has always suspected Krux of having deep pockets and has no qualms about trying to gouge him. In truth, Krux has squandered most of his money and can barely afford to return the balance of Fel's lease payment, let alone pay the extra amount she's demanding.

Negotiation is not Krux's strong suit, and the giff turns to the characters for help in convincing Fel to let them use the ship. A character can do so by impressing upon her the urgency of the party's mission and succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. The check is made with advantage if the characters refund the rest of Fel's lease payment (400 gp). If the check fails, Fel is unmoved, and further attempts by that character to sway her fall on deaf ears.

If the party doesn't have any spellcasters, Krux points out that they will need to hire a spelljammer. If the party tries to retain Fel's services for this purpose, the tiefling insists on a fee of 1,000 gp in addition to whatever agreement they reach regarding her other demands. If it's obvious the party can't pay what she's asking up front, Fel is willing to accompany them in exchange for a 25 percent share of any treasure they find until she is paid in full.

If the party threatens to take the *Second Wind* by force, Fel storms off the ship. Within an hour, she finds four **veterans** who are willing to help her retake the ship. These veterans are armed with pistols (range 30/90 ft.) instead of heavy crossbows. If the *Second Wind* isn't gone by the time she returns, Fel and her hired guns attack.

#### Flinch

The first mate of the *Second Wind* is a neutral good **hadozee explorer** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) whom Krux refers to as Mister Flinch. The hadozee is also a skilled seamster; the repairs to the ship's sails are his work. Upon meeting the characters, the friendly hadozee begins offering unsolicited guidance on how to improve their wardrobes.

Flinch is an old comrade-in-arms of **Commodore Krux** and stands by the giff through thick and thin. The hadozee knows about Krux's history with the astral elves but says nothing of it, replying, if pressed, that "'tis not my tale to tell." Flinch has spent the last several months keeping an eye on the ship for Krux while serving in Fel's crew. He is relieved to have Krux back on board and glad to see his friend in such high spirits, though he privately worries that if their upcoming mission should fail, that might be more than the old soldier could bear.

#### Starbough

The tree rooted to the *Second Wind*'s sterncastle is a **treant** named Starbough, who is largely indifferent to the aims of either Krux or the party. Like many of its kind, the treant considers most Humanoids' problems to be fleeting affairs and takes a much longer view of life.

Within Starbough's reach are ten mangonel stones, which the treant can throw like rocks.

### To the Edge of Wildspace

Once the characters are aboard the *Second Wind* and safely off the Rock of Bral, Krux reveals his plan to them: to travel to another Wildspace system called Doomspace, where enemies of the Xaryxian Empire are assembling a coalition. Krux believes that the characters' only hope of saving their planet lies in joining the coalition. Krux doesn't know much about Doomspace, though, so the ship's immediate destination is a lonely tower on an asteroid, where a wizard-cartographer named **Topolah** lives. **Topolah** is Krux's friend, and he's certain she will be able to provide him with a map of Doomspace. Her tower is at the very edge of the Wildspace system.

Having a new venture to occupy his thoughts lifts Krux's spirits. The giff stops drinking and moves about his ship with purpose and authority, barking out orders like the military commander he once was. Any time the conversation turns to Krux's history with the Xaryxian Empire, however, the giff becomes quiet and brooding. It's obvious there is a painful memory Krux doesn't feel comfortable sharing yet; if pressed, the giff waves dismissively, muttering, "Things are bound to turn out differently this time." (More information about Krux's secret can be found in chapter 7.)

### Ruthless Reigar

Because of their exploits earlier in this adventure, the characters have unknowingly made an enemy of **Hastain**, a chaotic evil **reigar** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) who lives in a small palace on the Rock of Bral. **Hastain** is a longtime ally of the Xaryxian Empire, which holds a grudge against **Commodore Krux** (for reasons described in chapter 7). **Hastain**'s spies have been watching the giff, reporting on his activities and contacts.

When word of the recent altercation between the characters and the astral elves gets back to **Hastain**, the reigar decides to punish the characters for their insolence. **Hastain** pursues them in an **esthetic** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), which trails the *Second Wind* at a safe distance. Once it becomes obvious that the party is heading to meet **Topolah**, a wizard the reigar knows by reputation, **Hastain** decides to put an end to the characters' meddling:

>>Closing in from behind is a gigantic, bioluminescent, jellyfish-like creature with a flamboyantly dressed figure standing inside its glassy dome.
>>

![{@creature Hastain|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/020-10-004.hastain.webp)

The esthetic is 250 feet away at the start of the battle and tries to get close enough to attack the *Second Wind* with its tentacles. The reigar casts *dimension door* on their first turn, using the spell to board the party's ship. When that happens, read:

>>A magical doorway appears on the main deck of your ship. The flamboyantly dressed figure steps through it brandishing a trident, and the doorway closes behind them. Sparkling light surrounds the figure. "Heading to **Topolah**'s tower, are we? I don't think so. My friends in the Xaryxian Empire don't want you meddling in their affairs.
>>
>>"But forgive me, I haven't introduced myself. My name is **Hastain**. When the elves came looking for a suitable world to nourish their dying star, I suggested yours. It isn't every day I get to witness the destruction of a planet. I promise, it will end beautifullyÃ¢ÂÂeven if you're not alive to see it."
>>

**Hastain** uses Summon Duplicate on their second turn in combat. While the reigar and the duplicate attack the characters, the esthetic uses Jammerscream against the *Second Wind*, then moves close enough to the ship to attack with its tentacles if it isn't close enough already.

#### Victory

If **Hastain** dies, the **esthetic** uses Jammerscream against the *Second Wind* if the ship's *spelljamming helm* hasn't already been disabled.

If the characters win the battle but their *spelljamming helm* is disabled, read:

>>You have won a victory, but at what cost? You're stranded on a ship without a functional *spelljamming helm*, adrift in the vast ocean of Wildspace.
>>

#### Defeat

If the characters and their allies are defeated, the reigar returns to the esthetic and commands it to demolish what's left of the *Second Wind*. Enough of the ship's air envelope remains to keep any surviving characters and crew members alive for 8 hours.

If **Hastain** prevails but the esthetic did not survive, the reigar takes control of the *Second Wind* and flies it back to the Rock of Bral, but only after jettisoning the characters and crew and leaving them with enough flotsam and jetsam around them to provide only an hour or two of breathable air.

*Here ends chapter 4.*

## Chapter 5: Living on the Edge

>>*The Xaryxian Empire attacked the characters' world, forcing them to take refuge on the Rock of Bral. There, they met a sympathetic giff named Krux. Aboard his ship, the* Second Wind, *the characters headed to a wizard's tower on the outskirts of Wildspace, where Krux hopes to acquire a map. En route to the tower, the* Second Wind *was attacked by Hastain, an evil ally of the Xaryxian Empire*!
>>

If the *Second Wind* was disabled or destroyed in the last session, the characters get to the wizard's tower with the help of a pod of migrating kindori.

Once they reach their destination, Krux and the characters hope to obtain a map of Doomspace from **Topolah**, a reclusive wizard. After defeating a void scavver named **Big Momma**, the characters seek out a notorious pirate who might be willing to join their fight against the Xaryxian Empire.

### Adrift

If the *Second Wind* is intact and its *spelljamming helm* is functional, skip ahead to "Topolah's Tower."

If the *Second Wind* was destroyed or its *spelljamming helm* was disabled, read the following text to begin the session:

>>Krux takes a drag from his pipe. "Settle in, everyone. We could be here for a while."
>>

The characters have enough time to take a short rest before the kindori arrive.

#### Kindori Pod

An hour after the events of the previous chapter, the characters encounter a pod of six **kindori** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) flying across space along a migration route. The kindori defend themselves if attacked but otherwise pose no threat.

The kindori keep their distance, staying at least 100 feet away from the crew of the *Second Wind*. The kindori are, however, attracted to lights. If the characters don't think of it themselves, **Commodore Krux** encourages someone to flash or wave a light to get the pod's attention. Flashing or waving a light causes one or two kindori to approach within 15 feet of the light's source while the remaining kindori keep their distance.

#### Lassoing and Riding a Kindori

A character who has a rope can use an action to try to lasso a kindori, treating the rope as an improvised ranged weapon. Alternatively, a character within reach of a kindori can to try to climb onto its body as an action, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Lassoing or riding a kindori doesn't cause it to attack.

A kindori lashed to the *Second Wind* with rope pulls the ship across space in whatever direction it is headed. Krux knows the way to **Topolah**'s tower and can indicate which direction the kindori must go to reach it. The tower isn't along the whales' migration path, so a character must coax the kindori into altering course.

As an action, a character mounted on a kindori can try to guide it in a particular direction, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. This check has advantage if the character has some way to communicate with the kindori (telepathy, for example). If the check fails, the kindori refuses to alter course. If the check fails by 5 or more, the kindori also dislodges the character, who is pushed 10 feet away from the kindori before falling into its gravity plane.

With the help of one or more kindori, the characters arrive at **Topolah**'s tower after 72 hours of travel, after which the kindori resume their migration. If the *Second Wind* is intact and its *spelljamming helm* becomes operational before then, Krux orders the characters to release the kindori so the creatures can go on their way.

### Topolah's Tower

**Topolah**'s tower is perched on a flat-topped asteroid with an air envelope that extends 180 feet above and below the asteroid and 100 feet away from its sides. The asteroid's gravity plane intersects it horizontally at the level of the docks and the base of the tower.

![Topalah's Tower](img/adventure/LoX/021-map-10.01-topalahs-tower.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/022-map-10.01-topalahs-tower-player.webp)As the tower comes into view, read:

>>A crooked tower perches atop a small asteroid, surrounded by a cloud of twinkling cosmic dust.
>>
>>Through his spyglass, Krux examines the rock upon which the tower stands and the decrepit wooden pier that juts from one side of it. "Mr. Flinch," he says, "ready the jolly!"
>>

If the *Second Wind* was lost in the previous chapter, characters can ride the kindori to the dock. Otherwise, Krux is concerned about the poor state of **Topolah**'s dock and fears the *Second Wind* might accidentally smash it to flinders or rip it off its moorings. For this reason, he orders Flinch to deploy a jolly boat while the *Second Wind* remains 100 feet away, its gravity plane aligned with the gravity plane of the asteroid. Flinch uses a winch to lower *Big Bluster*, one of the *Second Wind*'s jolly boats, into the overlapping gravity planes of **Topolah**'s Tower and the *Second Wind*. Characters can use the six oars aboard the jolly boat to propel it to the docks while Krux stands proudly in the bow, pointing to the dock as if the destination were not obvious.

#### Approaching the Dock

As Krux and the characters make their way to the dock, read:

>>Scores of pelicans, mollymawks, and smaller birds nesting on the asteroid squawk as you approach the rickety dock. At the end of the dock, two gray, shark-like creatures fight over the remains of a pelican.
>>
>>A woman with frayed robes and bare feet sits in a rocking chair at the base of the tower watching the fracas, her face half hidden by a wide-brimmed hat that has a blue jay perched on it. The woman leaps to her feet, brandishes a staff, and snarls, "Go on, git!" A fiery ray springs from her fingertip, frightening away the shark-like creatures.
>>

The woman is **Topolah**, a chaotic good **mage**. She is elated to receive visitors, especially since one of them is her old friend Krux.

After welcoming Krux and his companions to her tower, **Topolah** insists on showing the characters her abode (see "Tour of the Tower" below). If Krux or the characters mention the purpose of their visit (to acquire a map of Doomspace), **Topolah** tells them she'll talk business only after the tour is over.

#### Tower Features

Aside from its crooked architecture, **Topolah**'s tower has the following features:

- **Autognomes.** When **Topolah** purchased an expensive telescope from Orwyck Cogsworth, a gnome inventor on the Rock of Bral, he threw in eight **autognomes** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) that he built in his likeness, each sporting a dazzling metal mustache. The indifferent autognomes have the three directives common to all their kind plus the following directive: "Defend **Topolah** from hostile creatures."

![{@creature Topolah|LoX} and Her Birds](img/adventure/LoX/023-10-005.topolah-and-her-birds.webp)

- **Birds.** Harmless birds nest in all areas of the tower.
- **Ceilings and Floors.** Openings in the floors and ceilings connect the tower's three levels. A magical rope-and-pulley mechanism serves as an elevator; a creature need only grab hold of the rope and say "up" or "down" to be hoisted or lowered one floor as desired.
- **Illumination.** *Continual flame* spells bathe the interior in bright light. **Topolah** can suppress or reactivate the illumination on a particular floor by clapping three times while she is on that floor.
- **Walls.** From the outside, the tower initially appears to have no windows. **Topolah** can cause an open window (up to 4 feet wide by 10 feet tall) to appear on any wall simply by touching it, or she can make a window disappear with a snap of her fingers. A creature in a window (perhaps sitting on the sill) when the opening disappears is pushed out of the tower a split second before the window vanishes.

#### Tour of the Tower

**Topolah** gives the characters a quick look at each floor of her tower, showing them how to operate the rope-and-pulley device to get from one floor to the next.

The boxed text describing each floor of the tower includes information that **Topolah** gives during her tour.

#### First Floor

>>Four ring-shaped garden terraces line the walls of this cylindrical chamber. The gardens are vertically spaced every ten feet and brimming with luscious fruits, vegetables, and golden wheat. Four mechanical gnomes wearing harnesses tend to the plants. The harnesses are attached to ropes that loop around pulleys affixed to the ceiling, enabling the gnomes to hoist themselves into the air and move from one plot to another.
>>
>>"Most of my sustenance comes from these gardens," says **Topolah**. "I get regular deliveries of fresh soil from dohwar merchants, and they get home-grown food and birds' eggs in return."
>>

The four **autognomes** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) here are named Orwyck 1, Orwyck 3, Orwyck 6, and Orwyck 8. Their rope-and-pulley harnesses enable them to tend to the gardens.

#### Second Floor

>>This floor houses a modest kitchen where two mechanical gnomes are preparing dinner. Furnishings include an unmade bed, a wardrobe topped with bird nests, and a bookshelf packed with astrological texts and more bird nests.
>>
>>"Here are my living quarters," says **Topolah**, "where I read my books and take my meals. My autognomes have no shortage of recipes. Today's repast is a deep-fried night scavver steak with a lunar bÃÂ©chamel."
>>

The two **autognomes** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), Orwyck 2 and Orwyck 4, pay no mind to guests as they prepare **Topolah**'s next meal.

***Treasure.*** **Topolah**'s wardrobe contains an assortment of wizardly garments, including a *robe of useful items*, and her spellbook, the cover of which is splattered with dry bird droppings. The spellbook contains all the spells **Topolah** has prepared plus the following: *air bubble*,* *grease*, *haste*, and *Rary's telepathic bond*. (Spells marked with an asterisk appear in the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*.)

#### Third Floor

>>Two mechanical gnomes are using rags to polish a ten-foot-long copper telescope in the center of this chamber. Dozens of star maps lie atop tables that are also littered with sketches of planets and otherworldly landscapes.
>>
>>"And here is my observatory!" remarks **Topolah** proudly. "I acquired my autognomes from the same fellow who sold me this telescope, which allows me to spy on all the worlds in this system and gaze at stars in other systems as well."
>>
>>**Topolah** walks across the room and touches a wall, whereupon a tall opening appears in front of the telescope. "Would you care to have a look?"
>>

The two **autognomes** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), Orwyck 5 and Orwyck 7, keep a close eye on visitors.

The telescope is pointed at the characters' home world. **Topolah** has been observing the planet for the past several days. Anyone who looks through the telescope can see crystalline vines engulfing the planet.

***Star Maps.*** The observatory contains forty-two maps of various Wildspace systems. None of them depict Doomspace or Xaryxispace (the two other systems featured in this adventure).

***Treasure.*** A *Wildspace orrery* (see the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*) rests on a shelf. **Topolah** acquired this magic item from a mercane trader some time ago but lost interest in the item because it makes her feel obsolete.

#### Obtaining a Map

After finishing her tour, **Topolah** is ready to talk business. She starts the conversation with "What brings you to my tower?"

When she finds out that Krux was expecting her to have a map of Doomspace, **Topolah** reluctantly says she doesn't have one. But to take its place, she is willing to part with the *Wildspace orrery* she keeps in her observatory. In exchange, she asks the characters to agree to dispose of a local threat:

>>"A void scavver has started prowling around my tower. I call her **Big Momma** because she's enormous. I'm surprised you didn't come across her, but then, she can be hard to seeÃ¢ÂÂexcept for her single red eye. I'll give you my *Wildspace orrery* if you slay **Big Momma** for me."
>>

**Topolah** trusts Krux and the characters to make good on their promise to kill **Big Momma**. Before giving them the *Wildspace orrery*, **Topolah** explains how it works:

>>"This gizmo shows you where you are in relation to the planets, moons, and sun in a Wildspace system, but you must be in Wildspace to use it. To get to another system, you must first enter the Astral Sea, which will take you wherever you want to go. Once you reach your destination, use the orrery to get your bearings."
>>

As they leave her tower and head back to their ship, she wishes them luck saving their world from annihilation.

If Krux and the characters no longer have a ship, **Topolah** allows them to stay with her until another ship arrives, in which case you should modify the rest of this chapter as follows:

- Modify the "Oh, Momma!" encounter so that the **void scavver** attacks characters who loiter outside **Topolah**'s tower or on the dock.
- An hour after **Big Momma** is defeated, a cosmic storm engulfs **Topolah**'s tower. While marveling at the storm, **Topolah** conveys the information in the "Old Flame" section.
- During the cosmic storm, **Grimzod Gargenhale** pays **Topolah** a visit. Conclude with "The Last Breath," skipping over "Gargenhale's Fleet."

### Oh, Momma!

Ask the players which character has the *Wildspace orrery*. If none of the characters want to carry it, Krux takes it. With the item in their possession, Krux and the characters can hop aboard their jolly boat and return to the *Second Wind*.

Have Krux and each character make a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check. Those who fail the check are surprised when **Big Momma** attacks:

>>As the jolly boat approaches the *Second Wind*, an enormous jet-black behemoth glides out of the darkness and cosmic dust, its red eye glowing brightly as its jaws open wide. Long, stringy strands of saliva break off into weightless globs as the ravenous monster descends from above.
>>

![{@creature Big Momma|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/024-10-006.big-momma.webp)

**Big Momma**, a **void scavver** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), starts the encounter 40 feet from the characters' jolly boat, which is 50 feet from the end of **Topolah**'s dock and the same distance away from the *Second Wind*. On its first turn, the void scavver swims up to the jolly boat and attacks a random character. Characters who were surprised can't act until the next round.

A character can use an action and a pair of oars to row the jolly boat 10 feet horizontally in any direction along the gravity plane shared by **Topolah**'s asteroid and the *Second Wind*. Unlike the jolly boat, **Big Momma** flies through space like a fish through water and can move in any direction.

#### Belly of the Beast

If slain, **Big Momma** regurgitates a partially digested dwarf skeleton wearing a *fish suit* (see the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*).

### Old Flame

After the incident with **Big Momma**, it dawns on **Topolah** that she might know someone willing to help the characters further. She casts *fly* on herself and lands on the deck of the *Second Wind* shortly after the characters are back on board but before the ship departs.

**Topolah** offers to introduce the characters to a potential ally, **Grimzod Gargenhale**. She provides the following information:

- Grimzod is a pirate who has fought many battles against astral elves. Grimzod and **Topolah** had a tryst that never amounted to much and ended with a peaceful breakup.
- He has a small fleet of ships nearby and might be persuaded to help the characters.
- Gargenhale owes **Topolah** a favor.

**Topolah** doesn't mention that in the years following their breakup, Gargenhale met his mortal end and rose again as a **vampirate**. **Topolah** fears that the crew of the *Second Wind* might be discouraged by learning this fact before they meet Gargenhale in person. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check determines that **Topolah** is withholding information about Gargenhale and, if they call her out on it, can convince her to spill the beans.

If she's asked about it, **Topolah** doesn't divulge why their relationship fell apart, but she's quick to point out that she ended things with Gargenhale, not the other way around.

#### Welcome Aboard?

If the characters accept **Topolah**'s offer to lead them to Gargenhale's fleet, she attunes to the *spelljamming helm* of the *Second Wind* and pilots the ship with precision, grumbling occasionally about the vessel's lack of a battering ram.

If the characters prefer to continue without **Topolah**, she lets out a wistful sigh and hangs her head in disappointment. After giving Krux the directions to Gargenhale's fleet, she tips her hat at the characters and returns to her tower for a much-needed nap.

### Gargenhale's Fleet

Whether the characters head for Gargenhale's fleet or immediately set sail for Doomspace, their course takes them toward the wreckage of a recent battle:

>>Dead ahead, you see a cloud of debris that appears to be the drifting wreckage of several ships. Krux shouts, "To arms!" Peering through his spyglass, he adds, "Looks like three flying fishes, three lampreys, two squid ships, and two star moths."
>>

Krux's count is accurate. If **Topolah** is aboard the *Second Wind*, she recognizes the flying fish ships, lamprey ships, and squid shipsÃ¢ÂÂthey account for roughly half of Gargenhale's fleet. She is quick to add that Gargenhale's flagship, a space galleon called the *Last Breath*, is not among the wreckage.

Enough space exists between the wreckage for the *Second Wind* to pass through the area, which Krux is inclined to do unless the characters advise him to circle around the debris instead.

If the *Second Wind* passes through the wreckage instead of going around it, the following events occur in sequence:

- **Crimson Flag.** A blood-red pirate flag drifting in space becomes snagged on the Second Wind's ballista.
- **Drifting Corpses.** Two human corpses drift close to the Second Wind. As they bump up against the ship's hull, the figures reveal themselves to be two chaotic neutral **vampirates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) named Dorgio Dali and Vitalia Daggermore. These "survivors" of the battle clamber onto the deck and ask to speak to the captain. They say they're looking for a new commission and are eager to serve. Krux won't have them under his command, however, and orders that they be destroyed.
- **Scavenging Scavvers.** Three **gray scavvers** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) pick at the drifting corpse of an astral elf warrior. Wounding a scavver causes it to dart away.

#### Will-o'-Wisp

After the *Second Wind* passes through or circles around the wrecked ships, an invisible, chaotic neutral **will-o'-wisp** slips aboard the *Second Wind* and reveals its presence:

>>A tiny ball of light appears over the bow of the ship, quickly flies around the mast, and settles a few feet above the main deck, changing colors as it hovers in place. In a soft voice it says, "Lost, are we? Maybe I can be of assistance."
>>

The will-o'-wisp was with Gargenhale's fleet when the astral elves attacked. It stayed behind after the battle to feed on the life energy of the dying. It offers to guide the *Second Wind* to the location where Gargenhale's fleet typically regroups. This rendezvous point is a day away.

If questioned, the will-o'-wisp admits that Gargenhale made the mistake of attacking a star moth a while back. Since then, the astral elves have been aggressively attacking Gargenhale's fleet. The will-o'-wisp knows that Gargenhale is always looking for new ships to join his force, which is why it wants the *Second Wind* to travel to Gargenhale's rendezvous point.

### The Last Breath

The will-o'-wisp leads the *Second Wind* to Gargenhale's flagship. If the characters aren't looking for Gargenhale, he finds them instead. In either case, the following scene occurs after a day's travel:

>>You are caught in a cosmic storm. Lightning flashes through dense blue and purple clouds, illuminating the silhouette of a galleon with torn, flapping sails. Ghastly mariners stand on deck and cling to the rigging, staring at you with unblinking eyes.
>>

The *Second Wind* and the *Last Breath* are 250 feet apart at the start of this encounter. The *Last Breath*, which is badly damaged, tries to close the distance as quickly as possible. When the ships are within 50 feet of each other, Gargenhale makes his presence known:

>>The galleon's captain steps into view: a pallid, white-haired man with a barred metal mask covering the lower half of his face. His left hand detaches at the wrist, skitters up his arm to his shoulder, and waves at you with its fingers.
>>
>>Krux sneers at this sight and keeps one hand on his holstered pistol. "Vampirates," he hisses.
>>

*Here ends chapter 5.*

## Chapter 6: Grave Alliance

>>*After acquiring a Wildspace orrery at Topolah's tower, the characters fought a void scavver named Big Momma. After that battle, Topolah mentioned a possible ally in the fight against the Xaryxian Empire: a pirate named Grimzod Gargenhale. Amid a cosmic storm, the characters laid eyes on Gargenhale's flagship and its vampirate crew*!
>>

In this chapter, the characters come to terms with Captain **Grimzod Gargenhale**, who confesses that Xaryxian vessels have all but destroyed his fleet. His badly damaged flagship, the *Last Breath*, is all that remains after multiple engagements with the astral elves. The vampirate captain nevertheless still vows to destroy the Xaryxian Empire, but unbeknownst to him, his crew is on the verge of mutiny after their latest defeat.

### Ship of the Dead

The *Last Breath* is a space galleon that has been reduced to 90 hit points. Unless the characters take defensive measures, the galleon comes close enough for its captain, **Grimzod Gargenhale**, to be heard. Gargenhale is a chaotic neutral **vampirate captain** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*). He strikes a dramatic pose as he addresses Krux and the characters, toward whom he is friendly:

>>The undead captain places his boot on the rail along the deck of his creaky galleon and leans over the bow. His disembodied hand perches on his shoulder, and lightning from the cosmic storm flashes behind him.
>>
>>Gargenhale's tone of voice is inviting, but his dead-black eyes glint with malice. "It's dangerous out here. That menace from Xaryxis, Commander Vael, keeps sending ships to our system, but we do our part to thin the astral elves' ranks. You're obviously not with them. Care to identify yourselves?"
>>

Gargenhale lost his left hand in a sword fight years ago. The hand, which Gargenhale calls "Lefty," was later animated as a **crawling claw**. The disembodied hand can play instruments and communicate using simple gestures.

If **Topolah** is in sight, Captain Gargenhale's posture briefly slumps like that of a wounded animal. He then puffs out his chest, raises an eyebrow in her direction, and adds the following:

>>"Do my lifeless eyes deceive me? **Topolah**, my darling, what a surprise! If you've come to drive a stake through my heart, you'll have to return it first."
>>

After making introductions, the vampirate captain confesses that his flagship and its crew are all that remains of his fleet. The rest fell prey to ships under the command of Vael, whom Gargenhale calls the scourge of pirates, raiders, and anyone else who refuses to bow to the might of Xaryxis. Despite these cautionary words, Gargenhale tells any belligerent or opportunistic characters that his crew has already died onceÃ¢ÂÂand they won't hesitate to do so again in defense of their ship.

In conversation, Gargenhale is placid and convincing, but his words carry the bite of a vampire scorned. He warms quickly to characters who echo his distaste for the Xaryxian Empire.

![{@creature Grimzod Gargenhale|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/025-10-007.grimzod-gargenhale.webp)

#### Parleying with Gargenhale

Gargenhale wants to see the Xaryxian Empire crumble, but he's wary of embarking on a voyage to Doomspace alongside a bunch of nobodies. He requests permission to discuss terms in private, either aboard the characters' ship or, if the *Second Wind* was lost, on **Topolah**'s rickety dock.

Once Gargenhale is off his ship, one or more characters can try to coax the vampirate captain into joining their cause. If one character does all the talking, have that character make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check; otherwise, have all participating characters make a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) group check. If **Topolah** is present, characters have advantage on this check.

On a successful check, Gargenhale pledges to help the characters save their world from destruction, asking for nothing in return. On a failed check, Gargenhale won't agree to an alliance unless Krux and the characters join his fleet, adhere to the Pirate Code (see the "Pirate Code" sidebar), and call him Admiral Gargenhale.

As the captain of the *Second Wind*, Krux refuses to bend his knee to a vampirate, but a character can convince the giff to swallow his pride and yield to Gargenhale's authority by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. If no one succeeds on this check, Krux ends the impasse by offering to step down as captain of the *Second Wind* for the remainder of the mission, yielding command to any character who can tolerate undead allies better than he can.

When the two parties come to an agreement, Gargenhale bows deeply and invites the characters aboard his ship to celebrate their alliance with a bottle of Champagne du le Stomp. But before the characters can take him up on his offer, Gargenhale is betrayed (see "Mutiny" below).

> ##### Pirate Code
>
>**Grimzod Gargenhale** expects those under his command to abide by the following rules:
>
>- **Article 1:** Don't Eat Each Other. No crew member shall partake of another crew member's flesh or drink their blood.
>- **Article 2:** No Hymns. Many crew members' ears are sensitive to holy praise. While aboard the ship, bards and other musicians are allowed to play only secular tunes.
>- **Article 3:** Coward's Consequence. Those who abandon their post or shirk their duty shall be marooned.
>- **Article 4:** No Shipboard Conflicts. All disputes shall be settled on land.

>At your discretion, Captain Gargenhale's code can include additional rules, perhaps of your own design or as suggested by the characters.

#### Crew of the Last Breath

The crew of the *Last Breath* includes eight **vampirates**, a **vampirate mage** named Rutledge Wynn (who is seated in the ship's *spelljamming helm*), a dead-eyed **ogre zombie**, and a tiefling **ghost** named **Agony**; see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for *vampirate stat blocks*.

The following rules apply to **Agony the ghost**:

- As long as the *Last Breath* has at least 1 hit point, the ghost can't be permanently slain. If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points and the ship has at least 1 hit point, the ghost re-forms 24 hours later in the ship's cargo hold with all its hit points.
- If it moves more than 100 feet from the *Last Breath*, the ghost disappears and instantly reappears in the ship's cargo hold.
- While away from the *Last Breath*, the ghost can use a bonus action to magically teleport back to the ship, either to the lower cargo hold (area 13 on the space galleon deck plans) or a location it can see.

### Mutiny

![The Last Breath](img/adventure/LoX/026-10-008.the-last-breath.webp)

After negotiations with Gargenhale conclude, but before he can return to his ship, read:

>>The *Last Breath* turns tail and flees, leaving its captain behind. Gargenhale's dark eyes widen, then narrow. "What's this foul treachery?" he hisses.
>>

Unbeknownst to anyone aboard the *Second Wind*, **Agony the ghost** has taken possession of Flinch. Before the players roll initiative for their characters, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to them:

>>As Gargenhale bellows a curse at the dwindling stern of his ship, Flinch approaches the vampirate captain with glazed eyes and a dreamy smile. In a voice dripping with sarcasm, Flinch says, "Captain Gargenhale! Your command of the *Last Breath* is at an end. We've had enough 'victory' at your hands to last ten lifetimes." The hadozee then shudders as a horned ghost vacates his body, cackles, and disappears. Flinch blinks his eyes back into focus, then says in his normal voice, "Do I smell smoke?"
>>

Flinch remembers nothing of what has transpired. **Agony** the ghost took possession of him long enough to deliver its rebuke, then vanished and took refuge in the *Last Breath*'s cargo hold.

Gargenhale encourages the characters to give chase, saying, "Aboard my ship is a weapon you can use against the Xaryxian Empire! Help me retake the *Last Breath*, and the weapon is yours!" He refuses to elaborate until his mutinous crew is disposed of.

#### Giving Chase

If the *Second Wind* was destroyed earlier in the adventure, continue with "Shipless Pursuit" below. Otherwise, skip ahead to "Aboard the Second Wind."

#### Shipless Pursuit

Without the *Second Wind*, characters must use their own magic to pursue the *Last Breath* before it disappears inside the cosmic storm.

If the characters have no such magic but **Topolah** is present, she casts a *fly* spell on Gargenhale. Once a rope is tied around him, he can pull the characters behind him as he, with a flying speed of 60 feet, catches up to the *Last Breath*, which has a flying speed of 35 feet. Characters pulled behind Gargenhale must hold their breath for the short time they spend in the airless void of Wildspace.

#### Aboard the Second Wind

Characters aboard the *Second Wind* can use this ship to pursue the *Last Breath*, which disappears in the cosmic storm. As soon as he can, Gargenhale gives the *Second Wind* an edge in the hunt:

>>The vampirate captain drops to his knees and traces a pattern on the deck with his right hand. A shimmering wave of magical energy washes over the ship. Gargenhale then cackles in triumph, "We are invisible! They won't see us coming until it's too bloody late!"
>>

Gargenhale has used his Ship Invisibility action to conceal the *Second Wind*, although the effect is not readily apparent to anyone aboard the vessel.

To pursue the fleeing mutineers, the *Second Wind* must search the storm clouds in which the *Last Breath* is attempting to hide. The spelljammer of the *Second Wind* must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check, with advantage if one or more characters are serving as lookouts. The check can be repeated every 10 minutes until it succeeds. On a successful check, the *Second Wind* finds the *Last Breath* when the two vessels are 2d6 ÃÂ 10 feet apart. Since no one aboard the *Last Breath* can see the invisible *Second Wind* or its crew, the characters can close the remaining distance and climb aboard the space galleon, becoming visible only after they leave the *Second Wind*.

Gargenhale insists on joining the boarding party to retake his ship. If the characters allow him to do so, the invisibility effect on the *Second Wind* ends as soon as Gargenhale leaves that ship.

#### Firing on the Last Breath

If the characters seem determined to fire on the *Last Breath* from a distance, Gargenhale discourages this course of action:

>>"My ship is badly damaged and brimming with alchemist's fire. One well-aimed shot could cause her to explode. Better to slip aboard and dispatch the mutineers in close combat."
>>

Gargenhale is not lying about the danger posed by the alchemist's fire, which is described in the next section.

#### Boarding the Last Breath

The following locations are depicted on the space galleon deck plans in the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*. Locations that are not described below are assumed to contain nothing of interest.

![Last Breath Deck Plans](img/adventure/LoX/027-map-2.11-space-galleon.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/028-map-2.11-space-galleon-player.webp)
#### Forecastle

Six **vampirates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) are here, waiting to repel boarders. They fight until destroyed, knowing Gargenhale will show them no mercy if they're captured.

#### Sterncastle

The **ogre zombie** and two **vampirates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) are here, waiting to repel boarders. Like the vampirates on the forecastle, these creatures fight until destroyed.

#### 5: Spelljamming Helm

Rutledge Wynn, the **vampirate mage**, is here. If Rutledge is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he casts *dimension door* and transports himself 500 feet into Wildspace, then casts *fly* on himself and flees.

***Spelljamming Helm.*** The ship's *spelljamming helm* looks like a black, tall-backed, legless wooden chair with shackles bolted to its armrests. Red crystals sprouting from the chair's underside project a red pentagon on the floor that stabilizes the helm while allowing it to swivel.

#### 13: Lower Cargo Hold

This area contains twenty earth-filled coffins, ten wooden kegs painted red that contain gunpowder (see "*Explosives*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*), and ten wooden *kegs of alchemist's fire* (each marked with a stenciled green flame).

A *keg of alchemist's fire* lobbed at a creature or an object deals 21 (6d6) fire damage on a hit. Further, the target is set ablaze and takes the damage again every round (in the case of a creature, at the start of each of its turns) until the fire is put out. A creature within reach of the blaze can take an action to smother the flames using a blanket or carpet, reducing the fire damage by 2d6. Three such actions are needed to fully put out the fire.

**Agony, the tiefling ghost**, hides here. If it hears the characters approach or open the door to the brig (area 14), the ghost tries to possess one of them. It uses its host to smash one of the kegs of alchemist's fire, starting a blaze in the cargo hold. If this fire is allowed to burn for 1 minute, it ignites the other kegs and blows the *Last Breath* to flinders. Anyone and anything within 100 feet of the exploding ship takes 110 (20d10) fire damage.

#### 14: Brig

The door to this compartment is barred from the outside and has a tiny shuttered window built into it. Characters who peer through the window or open the door see the following:

>>An elf lies unconscious on a cot. She is clad in an ornate black dress accented with silver and gold. A high collar rises behind her head.
>>

If he's present, Gargenhale says, "Here's the weapon I promised you. I liberated her from a star moth we destroyed a few days ago."

The unconscious prisoner is an **astral elf aristocrat** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) named Xedalli. She has 0 hit points and is stable. If the unconscious elf receives any amount of magical healing, she regains consciousness but remains groggy and unable to think clearly or take actions until she is aboard the characters' ship or otherwise safe.

### Look, a Princess!

If the prisoner hasn't already been roused to consciousness using magic, she awakens with 1 hit point after 1 hour. Once she is awake and somewhere safe, read:

>>The elf's gold pupils twinkle as she speaks in a superior tone. "I am **Princess Xedalli**, daughter of Emperor Xavan and heir to the throne of Xaryxis."
>>

*Here ends part 2 of the adventure. Each character should gain a level before the next session.*

# Part 3: Chaos in Doomspace

![](img/adventure/LoX/029-11-001.part-three-splash.webp)

## Chapter 7: Trust Issues

>>*To save their world from the Xaryxian Empire, the characters embarked on a dangerous voyage across Wildspace. Along the way, they joined forces with a giff commodore, helped a vampirate captain quell a mutiny, and rescued a princess from the brig of the vampirate's shipÃ¢ÂÂnot just any princess, but the daughter of their enemy*!
>>

**Princess Xedalli** reveals that her evil twin, Xeleth, orchestrated the attack on the characters' world in accordance with the dying wish of their father, Emperor Xavan. If the characters help her become empress, Xedalli vows to save their world.

To have any hope against **Prince Xeleth**'s forces, the characters must travel to Doomspace and find **Warwyck Blastimoff**, Commodore's Krux's former comrade-in-arms. Warwyck has been trying to raise an armada with the help of a mercane arms merchant named **Vocath**.

### Princess Xedalli

Xedalli, a chaotic neutral **astral elf aristocrat** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), wears a *ring of shooting stars* and is initially friendly toward the characters. She shares the following information with the characters if she learns about the attack on their world:

>>"We both want the same thing: revenge. As my father lies on his deathbed, my scheming brother, Xeleth, denies me my birthright. He seized control of my father's navy, banished me from court, and left me in the clutches of his sycophants. He orchestrated the attack on your world, bombarding it with astral seeds harvested from Xaryxis, our dying star. Once the crystal vines have drained all the energy from your world, they will discharge that energy in a beam of light back to Xaryxis, replenishing it.
>>
>>"Xeleth instructed his minions to deposit me on your world so that, as I died, my energy could contribute in a small way to the light of Xaryxis. Fortunately for me, my ship was disabled and boarded by vampirates. Help me become empress, and I will undo the damage Xeleth has already caused your world."
>>

Xedalli is determined to help the characters, though she admits her motive has more to do with vengeance than sympathy. Understandably, Krux is hesitant to trust a princess of the Xaryxian Empire, but the commodore is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, if only to gain insight into the empire's weaknesses.

#### Roleplaying Xedalli

Xedalli presents herself as a rational, compromising alternative to her ruthless evil twin, but she's nonetheless a scornful manipulator who would sooner die than surrender her claim to the imperial throne.

Xedalli knows she must be patient to ascend the throne. Over the course of the adventure, the princess feigns empathy and uses some of her abilities to aid the characters in their efforts while keeping under wraps her most potent magic (such as her ability to summon a solar dragon).

If Xedalli learns that the characters are on their way to Doomspace to join a coalition, she bides her time, hoping the alliance will be strong enough to challenge her brother's claim to the throne.

#### What Xedalli Knows

Given a chance, Xedalli reveals the following additional information, most of which is true:

- Xedalli and Xeleth were meant to share the throne upon the death of their father, Emperor Xavan. (True)
- The death and funeral of the emperor are the final stages in his ascension to godhood. His dying wish was that he become one with the light of Xaryxis, when the star is at its brightest. That wish prompted Xeleth's attack on the characters' world. (True)
- The only way to save the characters' world is to destroy Xaryxis, the star at the heart of Xaryxispace. If the star dies, the crystal vines on the characters' world die as well. (True)
- A member of the imperial family can destroy Xaryxis by performing a ritual at the Astral Font in the Temple of Light, which is located in the imperial fortress. (False)
- The imperial fortress will orbit Xaryxis until Emperor Xavan ascends to godhood, after which the fortress will return to the Astral Sea. (True)

Xedalli conceals one important fact from the characters: one doesn't need to be a member of the imperial family to destroy Xaryxis, if one has a *ring of shooting stars* like the one Xedalli wears.

### Old Wounds

After conversing with Xedalli, the characters find **Commodore Krux** sulking by himself.

![Major {@creature Warwyck Blastimoff|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/030-11-002.major-warwyck-blastimoff.webp)

#### What's Wrong, Big Guy?

If the characters ask Krux why he's sulking, he reveals the source of his shame. Long ago, the commodore tried to destroy the imperial fortress in the Astral Sea, but his fleet was routed by the elven armada. Krux's flagship was one of a handful of vessels to escape, though only after it suffered terrible damage from **Prince Xeleth**'s solar dragon mount. Krux lost many comrades that day, and his hatred of the Xaryxian Empire is equaled only by his disgust at his own cowardice and failure.

#### Raising Krux's Spirits

Characters can persuade the giff to "buck up" with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Those who motivate the commodore with a rousing speech or a healthy dose of tough love have advantage on this check. On a successful check, Krux regains his resolve and stands ready once more to tackle the Xaryxian Empire. On a failed check, the giff sulks in his cabin; when he emerges 1d8 hours later, he is pickled in equal measures of ale and shame.

#### What Krux Knows

If his spirits are raised, Krux shares the following information:

- He plans to locate his former adjutant, an old giff comrade-in-arms named **Warwyck Blastimoff**, who left for Doomspace to join the coalition months ago.
- Krux and Warwyck used to communicate regularly by using *sending stones*, but Krux lost his stone on the Rock of Bral a few days before the characters encountered him.
- When the two giff last spoke, Warwyck was in Doomspace, on the moon of Aruun, entreating sentient plant creatures called aartuks to join the coalition. When he arrives in Doomspace, Krux plans to use the *Wildspace orrery* to locate Aruun.

### Into the Astral Sea

As the characters leave Wildspace and enter the Astral Sea, read:

>>The colors of Wildspace grow more muted, fading into a deepening silver haze. Soon your ship is immersed in the starry silver clouds of the Astral Sea.
>>

The ship's spelljammer need only think about the destinationÃ¢ÂÂDoomspaceÃ¢ÂÂto travel there. The Astral Sea takes care of the rest, with the ship arriving at the edge of Doomspace in 21 days.

#### Bonding with the Crew

As they travel to Doomspace, the characters can engage with other crew members. **Commodore Krux**, **Grimzod Gargenhale**, and **Topolah** are particularly fun to be around.

#### Commodore Krux

If he isn't sulking, Krux practices his aim with his firearms, and he invites the characters to join him. Five wooden targets line the port bow, each bearing the poorly drawn visage of an astral elf. Each target has AC 15 and 7 hit points. If a character destroys a target in one hit, the act sparks a rousing old war story from Krux, and that character gains inspiration.

#### Grimzod Gargenhale

The vampirate captain likes to gamble with other crew members in a game called Dead Hand's Dice. The buy-in is 5 gp per game unless the characters are feeling lucky and want to up the ante. The rules are as follows:

- Each player chooses any number of d6s and shakes them in a cup.
- Everyone rolls and reveals their dice at the same time.
- The player with the highest total wins, but anyone who rolls a 1 automatically loses.

#### Topolah

**Topolah** spends her time making fishing poles and lures, then gives them to characters she likes (see *"Astral Fishing"* in the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*).

#### Random Encounter

The characters have at least one random encounter in the Astral Sea. Determine what they encounter by rolling on the *Astral Sea Encounters table*, which appears in *Boo's Astral Menagerie* or choose an encounter you like.

### Arrival in Doomspace

As the characters leave the Astral Sea and enter Doomspace, read the following boxed text:

>>The silvery haze thins as the ship enters a system that appears to have no sun. The ship glides between colossal fragments of smoky-gray crystalÃ¢ÂÂremnants of an outer shell of fantastic proportions. As silent and lifeless as a graveyard, Doomspace gives new meaning to the phrase "dead of night."
>>
>>After three days of travel through the labyrinth of crystal shards, you catch sight of a yawning black vortex limned in dim light.
>>

If the characters use the *Wildspace orrery* they acquired in chapter 5, read:

>>The *Wildspace orrery* shows the black vortex with two planets slowly spiraling around it. The system also has twelve moonsÃ¢ÂÂone close to the vortex, one orbiting each planet, and nine outer moonlets.
>>
>>"There," says Krux, pointing at the biggest of the outer moons. "Aruun is just seven days away. With luck, that's where we'll find my old comrade, **Warwyck Blastimoff**. His mission here is to create unity out of chaos, and knowing him, he's done a bang-up job."
>>

For a map of Doomspace and more information about this Wildspace system, see the "Doomspace" section immediately following this chapter.

### The Aartuks of Aruun

With the help of the *Wildspace orrery*, the characters arrives at Aruun in ten days. As the ship approaches the moon, read:

>>Flashes of light on the surface of Aruun can be seen from orbit. As the ship descends toward the moon, you see a wasteland dotted with pillars of rock. Arcs of lightning leap from pillar to pillar.
>>
>>The ship heads toward a plateau that is one hundred feet tall, a mile wide, and covered with jungle foliage. Knowing the ship can't land safely, Krux gives the order for the ship to hover just above the treetops, then shouts, "Mister Flinch, drop the ladder!" On that command, the hadozee releases one end of a rope ladder that extends fifty feet to the ground.
>>
>>The jungle below is alive with the sounds of wildlife. "Who shall join me on the Away Team?" asks Krux.
>>

Krux is eager for the characters to meet Warwyck, so he insists they accompany him to the aartuk camp. Once all the team members set foot on the plateau, read:

>>A shot rings out. A few seconds later, a uniformed giff bursts through the foliage with a musket in one hand and a look of panic on his face. "Apologies in advance!" he shouts as he makes his way to the rope ladder.
>>
>>Pellets of radiant light fly through the air, narrowly missing you as several starfish-like plant creatures creep out of the jungle and advance threateningly.
>>

**Warwyck Blastimoff**, a lawful good **giff shipmate**, is out of ammunition and in a hurry. The creatures pursuing him are six **aartuk weedlings** and an **aartuk starhorror** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for their stat blocks). The aartuks are hostile and 30 feet away from the characters at the start of this encounter. The priest tries to snare Warwyck with its tongue while the warriors pepper the characters with radiant pellets or engage them in melee.

Once the aartuks are defeated, Warwyck lets out a long sigh of relief, salutes **Commodore Krux**, and asks, "Permission to come aboard, sir?"

### Bulette Time

Before Krux can formally introduce Warwyck to the characters, two **bulettes** erupt from the ground in the characters' midst:

>>The earth heaves as two massive, armored creatures burst from the ground. Warwyck shouts, "Bulettes!"
>>

*Here ends chapter 7.*

## Wildspace System: Doomspace

Part 3 of the adventure takes place in a Wildspace system called Doomspace, which consists of two worlds and twelve moons spiraling toward a vortex that used to be the system's sun.

### Doomspace in a Nutshell

Thousands of years ago, a war between gods and primordials ended with all gods being banished from Doomspace. After the war, the primordials encased the system in a crystal sphere that kept the gods at bay.

After being kept out for eons, the gods finally found a way to shatter the crystal sphere, but no one knows exactly how. The destruction of the sphere filled the outermost region of Doomspace with crystalline shards as big as asteroids.

What happened next isn't known for fact, but speculation abounds. Some say the gods appeared before the leaders of Fyreen and Malas and demanded to be worshiped. When they were rebuked, the gods vented their fury by collapsing the sun, leaving behind a spiraling vortex called the Eye of Doom. Those who deny the existence of gods refute these claims and turn to ancient myths for explanation. Perhaps the angry sun was slain by a primordial foe taking the form of a comet, or perhaps the sun was the shell of a great dragon's egg that finally hatched, and the so-called Eye of Doom is the hatchling's hungry maw.

The Doomspace table and the accompanying diagram provide an overview of this Wildspace system.

##### Doomspace
| Planet or Moon                      | Type                                                        | Distance to Outer Edge of System      |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Valt                                | Spherical earth body (detached moon)                        | 1,500 million miles (15 days' travel) |
| Fyreen                              | Spherical earth body with one moon (Crios)                  | 1,400 million miles (14 days' travel) |
| Malas                               | Spherical water body orbited by a moon-sized spindle of ice | 1,200 million miles (12 days' travel) |
| Aruun (one of the nine moons of En) | Spherical earth body                                        | 1,000 million miles (10 days' travel) |

#### Locations in Doomspace

The following locations are depicted on the map of Doomspace.

![Doomspace](img/adventure/LoX/031-map-11.02-doomspace-system.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/032-map-11.02-doomspace-system-player.webp)
#### Eye of Doom

The Eye of Doom is the remains of Doomspace's sun. This swirling, lightless vortex is slowly pulling the system's planets, moons, and crystal shards into it. Each orbit around the Eye brings Valt, Fyreen, Malas, and the nine moons of En closer to the vortex.

What happens to a creature or an object that enters the vortex? That's up to you. Although most creatures in Doomspace assume the vortex is a destructive force, it might be a gate to another dimension, an alternate reality, or another Wildspace system.

#### Valt

Valt was one of Fyreen's moons until it was ripped from the planet's orbit by the Eye of Doom. It is days away from disappearing into the vortex.

#### Fyreen

Fyreen is a volcanic world despoiled by dragons. The planet's remaining resources are hotly contested, giving rise to tyrants.

Temperatures on Fyreen plunged dramatically after the sun collapsed, but the planet generates enough heat on its own to keep it from freezing.

When the sun collapsed, **dohwars** and **mercanes** (both described in *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) evacuated thousands of creatures from Fyreen. Many of these creatures were deposited on the nine moons of En (which provide temporary solace at best) or borne safely to other Wildspace systems. Millions more creatures were left to be swallowed up by the Eye of Doom.

Crios, the smaller of Fyreen's two moons, still orbits the planet. But the same thing that is happening to Valt will happen to Crios in about a month.

#### Malas

Malas is a water world now sheathed in ice. Its surface is covered with sheer-sided mountains and deep canyons. A moon-sized spindle of smooth ice believed to be a shard of the planet orbits Malas. The spindle is home to a nation of highly intelligent but xenophobic **yeti**, among other things.

#### Nine Moons of En

En was a spherical air bodyÃ¢ÂÂa titanic gas giant. It is said that the primordials used the gases of En to help produce the crystal sphere that enclosed Doomspace, scattering En's nine moons in the process.

***Aruun.*** This large moon is home to rampaging **tarrasques**. *Aartuks* (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) and other smaller life forms live in the forests that grow atop Aruun's rocky pillars and plateaus, beyond the reach of the tarrasques.

***G'vek.*** This moon is dotted with sheer mountains that have become home to families of aarakocra evacuated from Fyreen. **B'rohgs** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), **death dogs**, **gorgons**, **hydras**, and other monsters stalk the foothills.

***Inivar.*** Inivar is a swirling ball of multicolored gas. An intense, flickering light emanates from the moon's core, creating a sort of celestial beacon.

***Lesk.*** The largest of the nine moons of En is a dark desert. Here, clans of *ssurran* (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) eke out a harsh existence.

***Shalar.*** Shalar is an ice moon with a ring of ice crystals circling its equator. Humans evacuated from Fyreen have built large camps on Shalar's polar ice caps, and dinosaurs roam the frozen landscape, feeding on scant vegetation and each other.

***Thrydd.*** Deep canyons crisscross the surface of this giant ball of ice. The canyons are heated by thermal vents and inhabited by **braxats**,* **gaj**,* **megapedes**,* **remorhazes**, *ssurran*,* and **thri-kreen**. (Creatures marked with an asterisk are described in *Boo's Astral Menagerie*.)

***Vocath.*** This moon, composed entirely of toxic green gas, is featured in chapters 8 and 9.

***Yisheen.*** This small, barren moon is covered with black frost and belongs to Yisheen, a miserly **adult lunar dragon** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) that abides no solicitors.

***Yort.*** This cold, swampy moon is strewn with the petrified skeletons of **kindori** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*). Humanoid evacuees from Fyreen have taken to building shelters among the bones.

#### Shattered Sphere

Smoky gray shards of crystal, each one a mile thick and hundreds of miles long, float in the outermost regions of Doomspace. These shards are all that remain of the immense crystal sphere that once enclosed the entire Wildspace system. At that time the sphere was thought to be indestructible, though clearly that is not the case. Various kinds of creatures have tried to harvest the crystal, only to find that it can't be chipped or broken by any magic or force known to them.

## Chapter 8: Arena of Blood

>>*Eager to join a coalition against the Xaryxian Empire, the characters arrived in Doomspace to find the system on the verge of collapse. Commodore Krux led his crew to Aruun with the goal of finding an old comrade named Warwyck Blastimoff, who was tasked with organizing a coalition in advance of taking the fight to the enemy*!
>>

The two **bulettes** that appeared at the end of the previous session can be fought, or the characters can retreat to the safety of their ship.

After thanking the characters for their timely rescue, **Warwyck Blastimoff** informs them that the coalition to defeat the Xaryxian Empire doesn't existÃ¢ÂÂbut that a mercane arms merchant named **Vocath** might be the key to creating one.

If the characters want to form a coalition, they must first persuade **Vocath** to call in his debts. The leaders of various space-dwelling factions are beholden to **Vocath** and therefore willing to listen to him, and they command enough spelljamming ships to form an armada. To gain **Vocath**'s help, the characters must perform in a gladiatorial arena for his amusement and thereby earn the mercane's respect.

### What Coalition?

Once he is safely off Aruun, Warwyck explains the current situation in Doomspace:

>>"My efforts to create a coalition have been unsuccessful. The factions of Doomspace have little interest in battling the Xaryxian Empire, which seems only a distant threat to them. They would rather fight among themselves. You saw for yourselves how prickly the aartuks were. My peaceful entreaty seems to have offended them.
>>
>>"The only thing these factions seem to have in common is their hunger for ships, spelljamming helms, and weaponsÃ¢ÂÂthings I can't provide. War is everyone's native tongue here, and the ones most fluent in it are the mercanes. The blue giants are making a killing by selling ships, helms, and weapons to the other factions in exchange for raw mineral resources.
>>
>>"But all is not lost. I've learned that the factions are in debt to a mercane named **Vocath**. He might be willing to help us... for a price."
>>

#### Questioning Warwyck

Characters who have questions about **Vocath** can get the following information from Warwyck:

- **Vocath the Mercane.** **Vocath** evacuated hundreds of aarakocra, humans, thri-kreen, and ssurran from the doomed world of Fyreen, then sold ships and *spelljamming helms* to them for next to nothing. All the factions strive to earn his favor.
- **Vocath's Base.** **Vocath** has a base that orbits one of the nine moons of En. He has renamed the moon after himself. (The characters can use their *Wildspace orrery* to ascertain that getting from Aruun to **Vocath** will take 3 days by spelljamming ship, since the two moons are currently 300 million miles apart.)
- **Vocath's Arena.** **Vocath** enjoys blood sports, and his base houses a gladiatorial arena where champions do battle with fearsome creatures that **Vocath** has transported from Fyreen. Factions send their greatest warriors to fight in the arena to get **Vocath**'s attention or to win supplies, weapons, or both.

### Vocath's Base

The three-day trip from Aruun to **Vocath** is uneventful, and **Commodore Krux** spends much of the time catching up with his good friend, Warwyck. Characters who observe the two giff notice that Warwyck's mere presence raises Krux's spirits, filling the commodore with hope and optimism.

![{@creature Vocath|LoX}'s Base](img/adventure/LoX/033-11-004.vocaths-base.webp)

When the characters arrive at **Vocath**'s base, read:

>>Floating above the luminous green clouds of **Vocath** is a structure made of gray and black stone, with large crystal formations jutting from the underside. Docks radiate outward from a building that is capped by a crystal dome. Several ships are moored here, including a galleon and four others that are shaped like a wasp, a scorpion, a lamprey, and a bird, respectively.
>>
>>Attached to the main building is a tower that has its own private dock near the top. At the end of this dock is a ship shaped like a damselfly, its metal hull painted bright blue. Flanking this dock are two identical forty-foot-tall statues, each one depicting a thin, blue, well-dressed giant.
>>

Crews of aarakocra, aartuks, humans, ssurran, and thri-kreen congregate on the docks near their ships, keeping to themselves as they wait for the next round of gladiatorial games to begin. Seven **githyanki warriors** (see "Tattooed Guards" below) keep the crews from fighting one another. The guards and the crews are indifferent toward new arrivals.

The docks are numbered 1 through 8 on the accompanying map of Vocath's base. Docks 1 through 7, which are used by visitors, are situated along the base's gravity plane. Dock 8 is the mercane's private facility.

The following ships, each of which is equipped with a *spelljamming helm*, are docked at **Vocath**'s base when the characters arrive:

![{@creature Vocath|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/034-11-005.vocath.webp)

- **Dock 1.** The Skyrra, a shrike ship, has a crew of eleven **aarakocra** and one **aarakocra spelljammer** (use the **mage** stat block, but give this aarakocra a flying speed of 50 feet).
- **Dock 2.** The Remora, a lamprey ship, has a crew of twelve **aartuk weedlings**, three **aartuk starhorrors**, and one **aartuk elder** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for their stat blocks).
- **Dock 4.** The Tarrasque, a space galleon, has a crew of hadozees (four **hadozee explorers**, fifteen **hadozee warriors**, and one hadozee **druid**).
- **Dock 5.** The Gadabout, a wasp ship with a torn-off leg, has a crew of two **ssurran defilers** and three **ssurran poisoners** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for their stat blocks). Its cargo hold has been turned into a ssurran egg nursery.
- **Dock 6.** The Vrusk, a scorpion ship, has a crew of eight **thri-kreen hunters**, three **thri-kreen gladiators**, and one **thri-kreen mystic**, who serves as the spelljammer (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for their stat blocks).
- **Dock 8.** **Vocath**'s yacht, a damselfly ship called the Devil's Deal, is moored at the end of this dock. For more information about this ship and its crew, see area 6 later in this chapter.

Docks 3 and 7 are clear of ships. If the characters are traveling aboard the *Second Wind* and Krux is in command, he chooses to berth the vessel at dock 3. If the characters are traveling aboard the *Last Breath* and Gargenhale is in command, he chooses to berth the vessel at dock 7.

Krux, Gargenhale, **Topolah**, and Flinch remain aboard the ship while the characters handle the negotiations with **Vocath**. Warwyck offers to join the characters and will fight alongside them in **Vocath**'s arena if they ask him to. **Princess Xedalli** wants to accompany the characters as well, but she won't take part in the arena battle.

#### Tattooed Guards

**Vocath** employs giff and githyanki guards, each of whom has the mercane's personal sigil tattooed on the back of their right hand. Having this mark allows its bearer to bypass certain security features (see "Magical Effects" below). As an action, a bearer of **Vocath**'s sigil can use the tattoo to cast the *message* spell, communicating only with **Vocath**.

#### Magical Effects

Several magical effects are present on **Vocath**'s base:

- **Extended Telepathy.** **Vocath** can establish telepathic contact with any creature on the base that **Vocath** can see or that is tattooed with **Vocath**'s personal sigil.
- **Lighting.** **Vocath**'s base is brightly lit with *continual flame* spells in braziers, lamps, and sconces.
- **Walls of Force.** Transparent, soundproof walls of force separate areas 1, 2, and 3. **Vocath** can pass through these magical barriers, as can creatures that are tattooed with his personal sigil. **Vocath** can suppress or reactivate one of these walls (no action required), even if he can't see it. Otherwise, nothing can physically pass through these walls. A *disintegrate* spell destroys a wall of force; a wall is otherwise indestructible and can't be dispelled.

#### Where's Vocath?

When the characters first arrive at **Vocath**'s base, the **mercane** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) is in his audience chamber (area 4), being attended by his personal bodyguards: Y'thraka, a jovial, lawful neutral **githyanki knight** with an eye patch, and Sergeant Burt Fluke, a foul-mouthed, chaotic neutral **giff shock trooper** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*). These two accompany **Vocath** wherever he goes.

When **Vocath** decides to stage a gladiatorial contest, he notifies the base's other guards so they can herd spectators onto the arena balcony (area 1). **Vocath** and his bodyguards then relocate to the mercane's private viewing box overlooking the arena, from where **Vocath** presides over the spectacle.

If **Vocath** is in danger, his bodyguards escort him to the damselfly ship berthed at area 6, which the mercane uses to escape from the threat.

#### Vocath's Base Locations

The following locations are depicted on the map of **Vocath**'s base.

![Vocath's Base](img/adventure/LoX/035-map-11.001-vocaths-base.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/036-map-11.01-vocaths-base-player.webp)
#### 1: Arena

The arena is a 60-foot-high octagonal chamber with a crystal dome overhead. The floor is blanketed in sand, with a few broken, unusable weapons and chunks of stone here and there.

***Balcony.*** A stone balcony circles the room 30 feet above the floor. This balcony is where spectators congregate to watch arena battles.

***Private Box.*** Twenty feet higher than the main balcony, 50 feet above the arena floor, is a private box where **Vocath** watches the contests, flanked by his two bodyguards. An ornate throne sized for the mercane is situated here, with two smaller chairs on each side of it for honored guests. Behind the throne, a shimmering wall of force (see "Magical Effects" above) fills an archway that leads to area 2.

***Treasure.*** Mounted to the underside of **Vocath**'s private box, visible to creatures on the arena floor, is a *mirror of life trapping* whose command words are known only to **Vocath**. The mercane has trapped the following creatures inside the mirror and releases some of them during the "Arena Battles" event later in this chapter: one **braxat**,* two **b'rohgs**,* two **hook horrors**, one **megapede**,* one **brown scavver**,* one **gray scavver**,* three **space clowns**,* and one **space guppy**.* (Creatures marked with an asterisk are described in *Boo's Astral Menagerie*.) Creatures released in this manner materialize in unoccupied spaces on the arena floor as close to the mirror as possible. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures trapped inside it are released at once.

#### 2: Armory

Two walls of force (see "Magical Effects" above) seal off this chamber, where three **giff shipmates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) and three **githyanki warriors** stand guard. Racks and shelves holding armor and weaponry are mounted to the walls behind them (see "Treasure" below).

***Treasure.*** The weapon racks and shelves hold ten *longswords*, ten suits of *half plate*, four *muskets*, four *pistols*, two hundred bullets, twenty *bombs*, and five *kegs of gunpowder* (see "*Explosives*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information on firearms, bombs, and gunpowder).

#### 3: Vestibule

Stone ramps from the docks ascend to this vestibule, where walls of force (see "Magical Effects" above) block access to areas 2 and 4. Two **giff shipmates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) and two **githyanki warriors** guard the vestibule.

Visitors seeking an audience with **Vocath** are expected to wait here until the mercane allows them into his audience chamber (area 4).

#### 4: Audience Chamber

>>This circular chamber has an ornate throne opposite the entrance, and the walls are lined with art objects, tapestries, paintings, and weapons on display.
>>

A wall of force fills the archway leading to area 3 (see "Magical Effects" above).

***Teleporter.*** While he is in this room, **Vocath** can take an action to teleport any number of creatures of his choice that he can see in the room to the arena floor (area 1) or to his tower sanctum (area 5).

***Treasure.*** On display are thirty painted statuettes of famous figures from across the multiverse (25 gp each), six blue quartz busts of **Vocath** displaying various poses and expressions (250 gp each), and eight model ships (750 gp each), as well as four elaborate tapestries (750 gp each) and four paintings of space-dwelling fauna (750 gp each). Racks hold ornate weapons and armor, including a suit of *+1 chain mail* and a *+1 greatsword*. **Vocath** is willing to sell these magic items for 2,500 gp apiece or trade either one for a different rare magic item.

If a creature other than **Vocath** touches any of the items on display, a mental alarm alerts **Vocath**, letting him know which object was touched.

#### 5: Vocath's Sanctum

>>The perimeter of this fifty-foot-high room is lined with silk-draped windows that afford panoramic views of the luminous clouds below and the distant, dark void that was once Doomspace's sun. Soft music plays throughout the room. Low tables are sprinkled around the floor, topped with refreshments. In the middle of each table rests a stout pedestal surmounted by a cerulean bust of **Vocath**.
>>

An unlocked stone door leads out to **Vocath**'s private dock (area 6). The music permeating the room is created by magic. **Vocath** can change the music and control its volume at will (no action required).

***Teleporter.*** While in this room, **Vocath** can use an action to teleport any number of creatures of his choice that he can see in the room to area 4. A creature can negate the effect on itself by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw.

#### 6: Private Dock

A private dock juts out from **Vocath**'s tower 80 feet above the public docks. The base of the pier is a wide platform anchored to the tower. An unlocked stone door leading to area 5 is guarded by two **giff shipmates** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), who stand between two 40-foot-tall stone statues of **Vocath**.

***Devil's Deal.*** **Vocath**'s damselfly ship, the Devil's Deal, is berthed at the end of the dock. The ship's crew consists of **Vocath**'s two personal guards (see "Where's Vocath?" above), five **githyanki buccaneers**, and a **githyanki xenomancer** who pilots the ship when **Vocath** doesn't want to (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for the githyanki stat blocks). **Vocath** has turned the ship's cargo hold into his personal bedchamber.

***Treasure.*** The *spelljamming helm* aboard the Devil's Deal is a legless chair carved from petrified wood. Black crystals on the underside of its concave seat project a circle of purple light on the floor that stabilizes the helm while allowing it to swivel.

Characters who search **Vocath**'s bedchamber find a folded-up *portable hole*, inside which the mercane has hidden 500 pp and thirteen gemstones (corundums worth 100 gp each).

### Meeting Vocath

To speak with **Vocath**, the characters must first interact with one or more of his guards, who use their sigil tattoos to contact the mercane and inform him of the characters' arrival. Interested to hear what the characters have to say, **Vocath** instructs the guards to bring them to the audience chamber (area 4), where **Vocath** greets them:

>>**Vocath**, a slender blue giant wearing elegant robes, sits on a large throne flanked by two bodyguards: a battle-scarred giff and a githyanki with an eye patch. Both are clad in plate armor.
>>
>>"I can't say you look particularly important," drawls the mercane. "So speak. Don't waste my time."
>>

**Vocath** is cold, smug, and oozing with pride. He knows that all the factions in Doomspace compete to please him. He is as dismissive of emotional pleas for the alliance of the Doomspace factions as he is of anything that doesn't turn him a profit.

If the characters mention the conflict with the Xaryxian Empire, **Vocath**'s demeanor turns cold, since that is not an event he sees as ending favorably for him. If Xedalli is present, **Vocath** assumes she's either the characters' prisoner or a traitor to the Xaryxian Empire; for her part, Xedalli follows the characters' lead, keeping her identity hidden or disclosing her royal title as appropriate.

If the characters plead for **Vocath**'s help, read:

>>"Enough with the 'me, me, me,'" **Vocath** says. With a mean glint in his eye, he adds, "I'll arrange a private meeting for you with the faction leaders if you can survive three battles in my arena, with no rest between them. Representatives of the factions will be watching, so fight well. An excellent performance might win their favor."
>>

If the characters agree to his terms, **Vocath** makes a dismissive gesture, teleports the characters to the arena floor (area 1), and heads to his private box to watch them perform. If **Princess Xedalli** is present, **Vocath** invites her to join him in his private box and watch the spectacle by his sideÃ¢ÂÂan offer she accepts politely.

### Arena Battles

After teleporting the characters to the arena floor, the mercane instructs his guards to usher spectators out onto the surrounding balcony, where they begin cheering in anticipation of the spectacle to come. **Vocath** acknowledges the throng from his private balcony. The characters have 1 minute to prepare before the first challenge begins.

The characters roll initiative at the start of each match, and they have no time to rest between matches. Victory in a match goes to the side that reduces all combatants on the other side to 0 hit points.

![](img/adventure/LoX/037-11-006.arena-battle-splash.webp)

#### Match 1: Thrasher and Gnasher

Two **b'rohgs** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) appear on the arena floor. They stand fifteen feet tall, have burnt-orange skin, and look somewhat befuddled as the crowd screams excitedly.

The b'rohgs have disadvantage on their initiative rolls as they adjust to the sudden uproar and their new surroundings. The rocks scattered around the arena floor are big enough for the b'rohgs to use as ranged weapons.

#### Match 2: Brutus the Braxat

Brutus, a **braxat**, is joined by a **brown scavver** and a **gray scavver** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for their stat blocks). They fight as allies.

#### Match 3: Queen Gorma

>>**Vocath** shouts, "Well done. Now prepare yourselves for the Terror of Doomspace!"
>>
>>Out of nowhere, a three-foot-long, wide-eyed space guppy appears before you, wagging its tail in a friendly manner.
>>

The characters have a moment to assess their foeÃ¢ÂÂa **space guppy** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*)Ã¢ÂÂbefore **Vocath** realizes, to his dismay, that he has released the wrong creature. Realizing his mistake, **Vocath** throws his arms into the air and says, "Forgive me. Let's try this again."

Queen Gorma, a one-hundred-foot-long **megapede** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) appears, snaps up the guppy, and swallows it whole. Meanwhile, the crowd shouts, "Gorma! Gorma! Gorma!" The megapede isn't a picky eater and targets foes indiscriminately.

### Xeleth's Big Entrance

When the last arena match ends, but before the characters have time to rest or take any further actions, read:

>>A portion of the dome above the arena shatters, startling the spectators and causing shards of crystal to fall like rain. A serpentine dragon with scintillating scales and nebulous wings sweeps down through the hole. Mounted on its back is an armored figure whose face is hidden behind a visor.
>>
>>The figure calls out, "I am **Prince Xeleth** of the Xaryxian Empire. I've come for my sister, Xedalli. Surrender her to me, you rats, or be annihilated."
>>

*Here ends chapter 8.*

## Chapter 9: Discord and Diplomacy

>>*To build a coalition against the Xaryxian Empire, the characters came to terms with a mercane named Vocath and fought monsters for his amusement. At the end of the final battle, Prince Xeleth of the Xaryxian Empire appeared on a dragon, determined to take Princess Xedalli into his clutches*!
>>

The session opens with **Princess Xedalli** trying to keep her hopes alive while protecting everyone around her from the wrath of her brother, **Prince Xeleth**, who has **Vocath**'s base surrounded. Xeleth has come for his sister. If Xedalli is either dead or presumed dead, obtaining her *ring of shooting stars* (the symbol of her right to the Xaryxian throne) is enough to satisfy Xeleth, because he can use it as proof of Xedalli's demise.

If Xeleth gains custody of Xedalli or claims the ring as proof of her death, his fleet withdraws from Doomspace, allowing the characters to renew their efforts to unite Doomspace factions against the Xaryxian Empire. Xeleth's attack on **Vocath**'s base is proof of the threat posed by the astral elves, giving the factions a common enemy.

### The Xaryxian Threat

**Prince Xeleth** is a chaotic evil **astral elf aristocrat** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) who wears a *ring of shooting stars*. After learning of his sister's escape from custody, Xeleth used the power of the Astral Font (see chapter 11) to cast *divination*. This spell enabled him to determine the whereabouts of his sister's *ring of shooting stars*.

![{@creature Prince Xeleth|LoX}](img/adventure/LoX/038-11-007.prince-xeteth.webp)

The **young solar dragon** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) that appeared at the end of the previous session was summoned by Xeleth using Summon Solar Dragon. The figure riding the dragon, however, is not Xeleth himself but an illusion of him, created by Xeleth's *mislead* spell. As long as he maintains concentration on the spell, Xeleth can interact with anyone present through this illusion. If the characters attack the illusory Xeleth or the dragon, the dragon retaliates.

#### Star Moth Fleet

The real Xeleth is safely aboard the *Xaryxia*, one of twelve star moths surrounding **Vocath**'s base. The star moths form a ring around the base while staying 250 feet away from it. Their weapons open fire on any ship that tries to leave the base. (See chapter 2 of the *Astral Adventurer's Guide* for information about star moths and their weaponry.)

If the characters decide to attack Xeleth's fleet, use nonplayer characters such as **Commodore Krux**, **Warwyck Blastimoff**, **Princess Xedalli**, and **Vocath** to make it clear that doing so would be tantamount to suicide. Each star moth is crewed by an **astral elf honor guard**, who serves as the captain; an **astral elf star priest**, who serves as the ship's spelljammer; and eleven **astral elf warriors**. The fleet is under the command of an **astral elf commander** named Vael, who also serves as Xeleth's bodyguard aboard the *Xaryxia*. (See *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for the *astral elves' stat blocks*.)

#### Vocath's Reaction

Annoyed that the characters have brought **Prince Xeleth**'s fleet to his doorstep, **Vocath** does all he can to prevent the characters from dragging him deeper into their conflict with the Xaryxian EmpireÃ¢ÂÂfirst by insisting that the characters comply with Xeleth's demands, and then by discouraging the Doomspace factions from doing anything that might escalate the current conflict at his base. If Xedalli is by his side, the mercane quietly and politely suggests that she surrender to her brother without a fight.

#### Roleplaying Xeleth and Xedalli

If the characters ask Xeleth why he wants his sister, he replies:

>>"Our father is dead. When I become emperor, I want my sister present at my coronation."
>>

News of Emperor Xavan's death comes as no surprise to **Princess Xedalli**. But she knows her brother well enough to assume he's not being entirely truthful about the rest of it. Xedalli clarifies Xeleth's motivation, addressing **Vocath** and the characters with this reply:

>>"Not everyone in the Xaryxian Empire supports Xeleth's claim to the throne. He needs me to legitimize it and prevent any unrest that might otherwise occur. No matter. I see that I have no choice but to return home with my brother."
>>

Xeleth doesn't deny his sister's accusation, nor do her words change the present situation. Xedalli sees no better option than to accompany her brother back to Xaryxispace. As the encounter unfolds, however, she uses the same trick as Xeleth: she casts *mislead*, turning invisible while creating an illusory duplicate of herself. While invisible, Xedalli addresses the characters through her illusion and praises them for their heroic attitude while discouraging them from getting involved in Xaryxian politics. While her illusion chatters on, Xedalli surreptitiously removes her *ring of shooting stars*, drops it on the sandy arena floor, and uses a *sending* spell to communicate the following information to a character she can trust to act on it:

>>"You'll need my ring to save your world. I've dropped the ring in the sand. Keep it safe. I'll be waiting for you in Xaryxispace."
>>

After giving up her ring, Xedalli moves back into the space occupied by her illusory image and ends her *mislead* spell, making it seem like she was there the whole time.

After parting with her ring, Xedalli surrenders to her brother. If Xeleth's solar dragon is still around, it bears her safely to the *Xaryxia*, where she is taken into custody. If the characters defeated Xeleth's dragon, Xedalli travels to her brother's ship on the back of another solar dragon she summons for herself. After his sister is aboard the *Xaryxia*, Xeleth orders his fleet back to Xaryxispace. As long as Xedalli is his prisoner, Xeleth doesn't care about what happens to her ring.

If he thinks Xedalli is dead, Xeleth assumes the characters have her ring and demands that it be tossed into his dragon's mouth (so that the dragon can safely transport it back to Xeleth's ship). If his dragon is defeated before it can deliver the ring, Xeleth orders Commander Vael to teleport to **Vocath**'s base with eight **astral elf warriors**, obtain the ring at any cost, and teleport back to the Xaryxia. **Vocath**, if he's alive, helps the astral elves retrieve the ring. He hopes they'll leave in peace afterward, which they do.

#### Xeleth Denied

If Xeleth is unable to obtain Xedalli or her ring, his fleet opens fire on the ships docked at **Vocath**'s base. (These ships are detailed in chapter 8). After 5 rounds of bombardment, the following ships are destroyed before their crews can mount a defense: the Skyrra, the Remora, the Vrusk, the Tarrasque, and the Gadabout.

Neither the characters' ship nor the *Devil's Deal* (**Vocath**'s damselfly ship) is damaged in the initial bombardment. But if either ship tries to leave **Vocath**'s base, the astral elves unleash their next flurry of ballista bolts and mangonel stones against the fleeing ship.

After the astral elves' initial bombardment, **Vocath** casts *dimension door* and boards Xeleth's flagship to negotiate an end to the conflict. If Xedalli is nearby, the mercane takes her along, and together they work out a deal in which Xedalli surrenders to Xeleth and the astral elves leave without further incident.

If **Vocath** isn't around to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict, Xeleth's fleet docks at the base and deploys troops once it's safe to do so. Enemy leaders are rounded up and executed, and any hope of forming a coalition among the Doomspace factions is lost. (Skip over the "Alliance in Doomspace" and "Assemble the Fleet!" sections.) When the characters are ready to leave Doomspace, continue with the "Red Dragon Rider" section at the end of the chapter.

### Alliance in Doomspace

After Xeleth is placated and his fleet withdraws from Doomspace, **Vocath** arranges a gathering in his private sanctum (area 5 of **Vocath**'s base, as described in chapter 8). This meeting is attended by the characters and representatives of the five Doomspace factions. **Vocath** and his bodyguards are also here, observing the proceedings in silence.

To forge a coalition, the characters must redirect the factions' animosity toward the Xaryxian Empire. The representatives with whom they must speak are summarized in the Faction Representatives table.

##### Faction Representatives
| Representative                                   |   Faction  |
|--------------------------------------------------|:----------:|
| Dakaer (neutral, hadozee **hadozee explorer***)  |   Hadozee  |
| Rika (neutral good **aarakocra**)                |  Aarakocra |
| T'kitka (chaotic neutral **thri-kreen mystic***) | Thri-kreen |
| Vortshu (chaotic neutral **aartuk elder***)      |   Aartuk   |
| Zoth'ess (neutral **ssurran defiler***)          |   Ssurran  |
*See *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for statistics.

#### Forming a Coalition

A faction's attitude toward the party depends on what the characters have accomplished:

- Two of the factions (determined by you) are friendly toward the characters by virtue of their victory in the arena battles. The remaining three factions are indifferent toward the characters.
- If the characters did anything to antagonize a faction, that faction is hostile toward them, regardless of their performance in the arena battles.
- The characters can improve a faction's attitude toward them by influencing that faction's representative (see the "Faction Representatives" section below). The best the characters can hope for is to align the factions against their common enemy, the Xaryxian Empire.

To convince a faction to join the coalition, a character must make a case to the faction's representative and succeed on a Charisma check using Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion, as befits the approach. Another character can use the Help action to grant advantage on the check, but only if that character makes a meaningful contribution to the conversation. The difficulty of the check depends on the faction's attitude toward the characters: DC 20 if hostile, DC 15 if indifferent, or DC 10 if friendly.

On a successful check, the faction joins the coalition. On a failed check, the representative declines to join the coalition, and the characters can't change that representative's mind until they convince another faction to join the coalition (discounting any factions that have already joined). The "Vortshu and T'kitka at **Vocath**" sidebar shows these rules in play.

> ##### Vortshu and T'kitka at Vocath
>
>The following is an example of the "Forming a Coalition" rules in play.
>
>A character approaches Vortshu, the **aartuk elder** (who is indifferent toward them), and tries to convince Vortshu that war against the Xaryxian Empire would give the aartuks new worlds to conquer. It's a sound approach, given aartuks' devotion to gods of war. But the character gets a failure on their DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, so Vortshu refuses to join the coalition, perhaps making the argument that the thri-kreen are a greater threat to the aartuks than the Xaryxian Empire. Further attempts to sway Vortshu fail automatically until the characters convince another faction representative to join their coalition. Having previously won over the aarakocra, the characters now set their sights on T'kitka, the thri-kreen representative.
>
>Like Vortshu, T'kitka is indifferent toward the characters. To improve T'kitka's attitude, the characters give her the *spelljamming helm* they took from the *Dark Star* in chapter 2. This fabulous gift is enough to improve T'kitka's attitude to friendly. A character then succeeds on the DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convincing T'kitka to join their coalition. With the thri-kreen now on board, the characters can make another attempt to convince Vortshu to join the coalition.
>

#### Faction Representatives

Each faction leader is described below.

>> ##### Dakaer
>>
>>*Hadozee Representative*
>>
>>Dakaer commands the *Tarrasque*, a space galleon. He often sounds terse, even when he is speaking unemotionally. He and his crew dress plainly and wield weapons made from bone.
>>
>>War is not something Dakaer longs for, but he seeks to acquire better weaponry nonetheless. His crew also clamors for healing kits, tools, and musical instruments.
>>
>>***Attitude Adjustment.*** The characters can improve the attitude of the hadozee faction by one step if they offer Dakaer a worthy gift, such as one of the following items:

>>- A set of artisan's tools or *navigator's tools*
>>- A *healing kit* or *potion of healing*
>>- A musical instrument
>>- A magic weapon

>> ##### Rika
>>
>>*Aarakocra Representative*
>>
>>Rika is the oldest crew member of the shrike ship *Skyrra* and chief advisor to its captain, Kree'esh.
>>
>>Rika's faction is concerned about personal freedom. Rika looks forward to guiding his people to a new Wildspace system where they can thrive.
>>
>>***Attitude Adjustment.*** Characters can improve the attitude of the aarakocra faction to friendly if they offer Rika a worthy gift, such as one of the following items:

>>- The *Wildspace orrery* acquired from **Topolah**
>>- A navigational chart for another Wildspace system

>> ##### T'kitka
>>
>>*Thri-kreen Representative*
>>
>>T'kitka serves as the spelljammer aboard the scorpion ship *Vrusk* and is keen to acquire more *spelljamming helms* and food supplies for her faction. She admits that the thri-kreen have taken to eating aartuks because of the scarcity of food in Doomspace (which hasn't endeared the thri-kreen to the aartuk faction).
>>
>>***Attitude Adjustment.*** Characters can improve the attitude of the thri-kreen faction to friendly if they offer T'kitka a worthy gift, examples of which are as follows:

>>- A *spelljamming helm*
>>- At least 30 days' worth of food

>> ##### Vortshu
>>
>>*Aartuk Representative*
>>
>>Vortshu, the captain of the lamprey ship *Remora*, is a warmonger who instigated a conflict with the thri-kreen. The thri-kreen have since acquired a taste for aartuk flesh. Characters can appeal to Vortshu's adversarial nature to win his support.
>>
>>***Attitude Adjustment.*** A character can improve the attitude of the aartuk faction to friendly in one of the following ways:

>>- By challenging the thri-kreen representative to a duel (which T'kitka declines, but the challenge alone is enough to win over Vortshu)
>>- By defeating Vortshu in a wrestling match, which requires the character to succeed on three DC 14 Strength (Athletics) checks before failing three of those checks

>> ##### Zoth'ess
>>
>>*Ssurran Representative*
>>
>>The ssurran of Fyreen are acclimating to life in Wildspace. Their leader, Zoth'ess, commands the wasp ship *Gadabout*.
>>
>>Zoth'ess needs money to repair her ship's broken leg and pay off debts to **Vocath**. She demands treasure in exchange for her support.
>>
>>***Attitude Adjustment.*** Characters can improve the attitude of the ssurran faction by one step if they offer Zoth'ess a worthy gift, examples of which are as follows:

>>- At least 500 gp in coins, gems, or art objects
>>- A magic item of uncommon rarity or better

### Assemble the Fleet!

Each faction that joins the coalition brings a certain number of ships to it, as summarized in the Coalition Fleet table.

If the characters convince at least four factions to join the coalition, **Vocath** decides their cause is worth supporting and telepathically reaches out to some of his mercane allies, who send additional ships. These ships come with their own *spelljamming helms* and crews. The mercane ships have crews pulled from different factions. The mercanes themselves stay out of the fight.

It takes ten days for the coalition fleet to assemble, during which time the characters can rest and make any final preparations before heading to Xaryxispace.

##### Coalition Fleet
| Faction    | Ships                                                                                                                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aarakocra  | 5 shrike ships, including the Skyrra                                                                                                     |
| Aartuks    | 5 lamprey ships, including the Remora                                                                                                    |
| Hadozees   | 3 space galleons, including the Tarrasque                                                                                                |
| Mercanes   | 2 hammerhead ships (one crewed by humans, the other by thri-kreen) and 5 squid ships (each one crewed by members of a different faction) |
| Ssurran    | 6 wasp ships, including the Gadabout                                                                                                     |
| Thri-kreen | 4 scorpion ships, including the Vrusk                                                                                                    |

### Red Dragon Rider

From now on, the adventure makes no assumption about which ship the characters are traveling on, but it is important for the characters to be together.

A few hours after they return to the Astral Sea, the characters have the following encounter:

>>The silvery fog catches the light of distant stars and coalesces into clouds that vaguely resemble faces as inscrutable as they are enormous. Perhaps these are the visages of gods watching over you, or perhaps they are merely figments of the Astral PlaneÃ¢ÂÂstray thoughts given form.
>>
>>None of that matters, however, as a distant roar draws your attention to one of the cloudy visages, from whose mouth emerges a large red dragon. Riding the dragon is a knight clad in golden armor, their face hidden behind a fearsome visor shaped like a dragon's scowling visage!
>>

*Here ends part 3 of the adventure. Each character should gain a level before the next session.*

# Part 4: Saviors of the Multiverse

![](img/adventure/LoX/039-12-001.part-four-splash.webp)

## Chapter 10: Space Invaders

>>*After the Xaryxian Empire attacked their world, the characters journeyed to Doomspace and formed a coalition. With a fleet of ships accompanying them, they set out for Xaryxispace, encountering a red dragon and its rider along the way*!
>>

Dagaz, a **githyanki knight**, is hunting **mind flayers** in the Astral Sea. Dagaz and her dragon mount fight only in self-defense and are, at best, a fleeting distraction. The real trouble begins when the characters enter Xaryxispace and make their way to the imperial citadel of the Xaryxian Empire, which is protected by a fleet of star moths.

### Knight of Tu'narath

A lawful evil **githyanki knight** named Dagaz rides a male **young red dragon**. These creatures begin the encounter 500 feet from the characters' ship.

Dagaz and the dragon are initially indifferent toward the characters. If the dragon is not attacked right away, it circles the characters' ship once as it identifies a safe place to land, then lands gently on the deck. Dagaz casts *tongues* on herself and addresses the characters moments later:

>>The armored knight lifts the visor of her helm, revealing the stern visage of a githyanki. "I am Dagaz, a knight of Tu'narath," she says in a haughty tone. "By order of Vlaakith the Undying, Queen of the Astral Sea, I declare that you are guilty of the crime of trespassing. As your punishment, it is my solemn duty to decapitate your captain. So, which one of you dung-eaters commands this barge?"
>>

After a beat, Dagaz smiles and adds:

>>"A bad joke on my part. I wish you swift passage through Her Majesty's realm. My dragon and I are hunting mind flayers. Have you seen any?"
>>

If the characters attack the knight or the dragon, the dragon retaliates by burning their ship with its Breath Weapon. If she takes any damage, Dagaz uses *misty step* to board the vessel and goes after whoever is responsible.

If the characters refrain from combat and inform Dagaz that they've encountered no mind flayers, she takes them at their word and bids them a safe journey to wherever they're going. If the characters inform Dagaz of their destination, she tosses one of them a vial containing *oil of sharpness* and says, "Give the Xaryxian Empire my regards." She and the dragon then fly away.

### Arrival in Xaryxispace

When the characters enter Xaryxispace, read:

>>You emerge from the silver haze of the Astral Sea and enter a Wildspace system illuminated by a white star.
>>

Using the *Wildspace orrery*, the characters can plot a course to the imperial citadel of the Xaryxian Empire, which is connected to Xaryxis by a beam of light 300 million miles long. The characters are 100 million miles (1 day's travel by spelljamming ship) from the imperial citadel when their fleet enters Xaryxispace. If the characters no longer have the *Wildspace orrery*, they can fly toward the star until they see the beam of light and follow it to the imperial citadel.

For a map of Xaryxispace and more information about this Wildspace system, see the "Xaryxispace" section immediately following this chapter.

### Attacking the Citadel

When the characters come within 1 mile of the imperial citadel, read:

>>Ahead, you see an elegant, crystal-spired city built on the back of an asteroid shaped like a moth, with shipyards sprouting from its wings. Atop the moth's head stands a magnificent temple. A beam of light stretches from a crystal atop the temple toward the bright white star, Xaryxis.
>>
>>An armada of crystal-winged ships patrols the region between your fleet and the citadel. The closest enemy ship is about a thousand feet away.
>>

The Xaryxian armada is not expecting an attack. Allow the characters to decide whether they want to open the engagement at range or close to boarding distance. In either case, the Xaryxian ships are surprised at the beginning of combat.

#### The Xaryxian Armada

The enemy armada consists of thirty star moths, each one crewed by an **astral elf honor guard**, who serves as the captain; an **astral elf star priest**, who serves as the ship's spelljammer; and eleven **astral elf warriors**. The armada's flagship, the *Xaryxia*, also carries an **astral elf commander** named Vael, who commands the entire fleet. See *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for the *astral elves' stat blocks*.

When the two fleets meet in battle, the *Xaryxia* singles out the characters' ship while the rest of the armada engages the other ships in the characters' fleet. The *Xaryxia* and the characters' ship are 1,000 feet apart at the start of the encounter.

Given the number of ships and combatants on both sides, it is impractical to track everyone's movements and actions. Instead, narrow the focus of the conflict to the characters' ship and the *Xaryxia*. In between actions, you can narrate glimpses of what's going on in the larger battleÃ¢ÂÂfor example, stray ballista bolts whizzing past the characters' ship or an aartuk lamprey ship clamping onto a passing star moth.

Although the Xaryxian ships are united in their determination to defend the imperial citadel, the crews have different political loyalties, as discussed in the "Loyalty to Xedalli or Xeleth?" sidebar.

> ##### Loyalty to Xedalli or Xeleth?
>
>The crew of the *Xaryxia* is loyal to **Prince Xeleth**, but not all ships in the Xaryxian armada share that loyalty. To determine the political leanings of another star moth's crew, roll a d6. On a roll of 1Ã¢ÂÂ3, the crew is loyal to Xeleth. On a roll of 4Ã¢ÂÂ6, the crew is loyal to Xedalli. Regardless of a crew's loyalty, no ship in the Xaryxian armada can be used to attack another Xaryxian vessel unless it has been commandeered by an enemy.
>
>A character who shows Xedalli's *ring of shooting stars* to one or more crew members of a ship loyal to Xedalli can, with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, improve the attitude of that crew, changing it from hostile to indifferent, by claiming to be acting on Xedalli's behalf. Xedalli's ring looks no different from her brother's, but a successful check is enough to convince the crew that the ring was entrusted to the characters by the princess. An indifferent crew breaks off its attack on the characters' ship but won't aid the characters in any other way.
>

#### Battle Losses

Each round on initiative count 0, the Doomspace coalition and the Xaryxian armada each lose one ship and its crew, in addition to any ships and crews defeated by the characters. Keep track of how many ships are left in the battle at the start of each round.

#### Here There Be Dragons

Seven **young solar dragons** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), born in the fiery heart of Xaryxis, fly around the beam of light that extends between the imperial citadel to the star. After noticing the battle, they join the fray, arriving just as the characters finish dealing with Commander Vael's flagship:

>>Seven dragons with multicolored scales and gaseous wings slither through Wildspace with their mouths agape like hungry serpents. Two of them break off from the others and head toward your ship.
>>

Two of the seven solar dragons fly toward the party's vessel while the remaining dragons harry other ships in the coalition fleet or scour the wrecks for treasure.

The two dragons are 1,000 feet from the characters' ship when they are spotted. Both dragons close the distance. One targets characters while the other targets the ship and its weapons. If either dragon is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, it flees. The dragons also break off their assault if a character stands on the deck of their ship and brandishes Xedalli's *ring of shooting stars*; the dragons have been trained since birth not to harm anyone bearing such a ring.

### Final Approach

Even if the characters survive the *Xaryxia* and the two solar dragons, it becomes obvious that the rest of their fleet is doomed. In response, they can fight on, surrender, or make a break for the citadel.

If the characters surrender to the astral elves or are defeated, read:

>>You watch as your allies lay down their arms and surrender. Now prisoners of the Xaryxian Empire, you are taken to the imperial citadel to face justice. Maybe this was your plan for getting into the citadel all along. Maybe not. Either way, all is not lost.
>>

If the characters avoid capture and make a break for the citadel, read the following text instead:

>>The imperial citadel looms large, its crystal spires reflecting the light of Xaryxis. It is here, in the heart of the Xaryxian Empire, that you will decide the fate of your world.
>>

*Here ends chapter 10.*

## Wildspace System: Xaryxispace

Part 4 of the adventure takes place in a Wildspace system under the control of the Xaryxian Empire.

### Xaryxispace in a Nutshell

Xaryxis is a white-hot star that is both the literal and figurative heart of the astral elves' empire. The astral elves discovered how to harness the star's power, using it to fuel their magic. When, after thousands of years of exploitation, Xaryxis's light began to dim, the astral elves began harvesting astral seeds from the star to tap the energy of other celestial bodies and use it to replenish the strength of their star.

Xaryxispace is a small Wildspace system, consisting only of its central star and three natural satellites, plus a floating citadel constructed by the astral elves of the Xaryxian Empire, who are the system's primary inhabitants. The Xaryxispace table and the accompanying diagram provide an overview of this system.

##### Xaryxispace
| Planet or Structure | Type                                       | Distance to Outer Edge of System   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Vaerduran           | Irregular earth body                       | 300 million miles (3 days' travel) |
| Rivus               | Spherical earth body                       | 200 million miles (2 days' travel) |
| Xaryndar            | Spherical earth body with one moon (Eysix) | 100 million miles (1 days' travel) |
| Imperial Citadel    | City in space                              | 100 million miles (1 days' travel) |

#### Locations in Xaryxispace

The following locations are depicted on the map of Xaryxispace.

![Xaryxispace](img/adventure/LoX/040-map-12.01-xaryxis-space.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/041-map-12.01-xaryxis-space-player.webp)
#### Vaerduran

This rocky, misshapen world once supported life, but its ecosystem was wiped out when it became the astral elves' first testing ground for their newly harvested astral seeds. Cracked and barren, this planet is now little more than a cinder.

#### Rivus

Another rocky world, Rivus escaped Vaerduran's fate because of its rich platinum deposits, which the astral elves mine. Although it appears desolate on the surface, Rivus bustles with activity belowground, where **umber hulks**, **purple worms**, and other burrowing creatures make their lairs.

#### Xaryndar

Xaryndar is a lush, green planet that teems with life. The flora of the world grow to extraordinary size thanks to the light of Xaryxis, and many of the planet's most formidable creatures are various kinds of intelligent plants. Most of Xaryndar's elf population left long ago to be closer to their gods on the Astral Plane, but the planet still has a few settlements that cultivate and harvest the crystal-leaf trees used in the construction of star moths.

#### Imperial Citadel

The imperial citadel is the administrative heart of the Xaryxian Empire and is described more fully in the "Citadel Overview" section.

### Citadel Overview

The imperial citadel is the seat of the imperial family, which includes Emperor Xavan and his heirs, **Princess Xedalli** and **Prince Xeleth**. The citadel is a mile-wide, floating platform of hewn stone shaped in the form of a moth. See the accompanying map for the citadel's layout.

The citadel, which has its own air envelope and gravity plane, is home to approximately 10,000 people, most of them astral elves. The few non-elves are diplomatic envoys to the court, traders, and skilled crafters whose work is esteemed by the emperor.

The imperial guard, which provides security within the palace and throughout the citadel, is composed of 150 **astral elf warriors** and 30 **astral elf honor guards** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) of various alignments, with half that number on duty at any given time.

No structures are built on the underside of the citadel, which is dotted with natural rocky protrusions. On the topside, stone walls 20 feet thick and 40 feet high control access to the gardens, the imperial palace, the Great Orrery, and the docks. Sixty-foot-tall stone towers built into the walls are topped with ballistae and mangonels.

![Imperial Citadel](img/adventure/LoX/042-map-12.02-imperial-citadel.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/043-map-12.02-imperial-citadel-player.webp)
#### Regions

The citadel is made up of the following regions.

#### Common Docks

These docks are used by ships belonging to tradespeople, visitors, private citizens, and mercenaries. Much of the traffic at the common docks consists of cargo vessels delivering food and other supplies.

#### Gardens

The citadel's gardens are trimmed and cultivated to represent an idyllic vision of Xaryndar's forests. The greenery replenishes the citadel's air envelope and serves as a bucolic refuge. Discreet conversation away from the prying eyes of the court often takes place here.

#### Great Orrery

The Great Orrery is the center of scholarship in the citadel. Enclosed by high walls, the facility is built around a gigantic orrery of Xaryxispace. This magical and mechanical contraption features levitating models of the system's planets and moons, all orbiting a brightly glowing crystal orb that represents Xaryxis.

A lawful evil, astral elf **archmage** named Magister Theraxana is here day and night, studying Wildspace systems that have been surveyed by astral elf explorers and looking for new worlds that can be exploited to keep Xaryxis burning bright.

A chamber beneath the Great Orrery contains a ring of twelve *spelljamming helms* joined together by crystal filaments. Theraxana and her fellow mages use these *spelljamming helms* to move the citadel across Wildspace and the Astral Sea, in accordance with the wishes of the emperor. All twelve helms are required to propel the citadel, which has a flying speed of 50 feet (5ÃÂ½ mph).

#### High Quarter

This region is where the palace's courtiers and trusted servants maintain their residences. A handful of shops and other establishments that cater to members of the court are also located here.

#### Imperial Docks

Only ships belonging to the imperial familyÃ¢ÂÂwhich includes the imperial navy as well as an assortment of pleasure craftÃ¢ÂÂare allowed to dock here. Guards patrol the imperial docks constantly.

#### Imperial Palace

From the upper floors of this stone and crystal palace, the ruling family has a commanding view of the vista that stretches out below. Including courtiers, guards, and servants, over a thousand people are in the palace at any time.

#### Low Quarter

The citadel's laborers and servants have dwellings in the low quarter. Here, too, are relatively cheap lodgings for visitors.

#### Military Quarter

Members of the imperial navy and the imperial guard maintain residences in the military quarter. Most members of the guard can be found here when they are not on duty.

#### Temple of Light

The Temple of Light is where the light of Xaryxis is harnessed for the astral elves' use. Atop the temple is a giant crystal that receives and focuses the star's light and channels that energy into a pool in the center of the temple called the Astral Font, which powers the empire's most potent magic. Andavier, a lawful neutral **astral elf star priest** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), oversees the temple.

More information about the temple is presented in chapter 11.

#### Trade Quarter

Most of the citadel's merchants and crafters live and work in the trade quarter. Much of the citadel's commerce takes place here, making it the liveliest area of the city. Well-appointed lodgings are also available for visitors with coin to spare.

## Chapter 11: Crowning Moment

>>*Determined to save their world, the characters traveled to Xaryxispace with a fleet of ships at their command. But nothing could have prepared them for the armada of enemy ships and the host of solar dragons guarding the magnificent citadel of the Xaryxian Empire. Though the battle was lost, hope remains*!
>>

The characters' arrival at the imperial citadel coincides with the funeral of Emperor Xavan. When Xedalli challenges her brother's claim to the throne and names the characters as her champions, the heroes must do battle with a **zodar** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) to decide who will rule as the next emperor.

### Arrival at the Citadel

When the characters approach the imperial citadel, either as prisoners or in their own ship, read:

>>As your ship draws closer to the citadel, you can make out thousands of people in the streets. The crowds surround the temple at the citadel's peak. By comparison, the two docking platforms at the tail end of the citadel seem quiet.
>>

Characters who have been taken prisoner by the astral elves are stripped of all visible weapons, but they are allowed to keep their armor and other gear. (The same is true for any nonplayer characters who are with them.) A character can conceal a light weapon on their person by succeeding on a DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

Prisoners are delivered to the imperial docks, where they are met by six lawful neutral **astral elf warriors** and a lawful neutral **astral elf honor guard** named Corelleth (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for their stat blocks), all of whom are loyal to **Princess Xedalli**:

>>Stepping onto a landing, you are met by seven armored figures, their faces hidden behind filigreed visors. Their leader takes a step forward and says, "I am Commander Corelleth. My orders are to deliver you to the Temple of Light to face the emperor's justice." The commander then orders your captors to return your weapons to you. "**Princess Xedalli** sends her regards."
>>

Weapons confiscated from the characters and their allies are promptly returned to them, after which Corelleth's squad leads the group through the streets of the citadel to the Temple of Light. If the characters flee from their escort, Corelleth's squad doesn't pursue, per Xedalli's instructions.

On the way to the temple, Corelleth gives honest answers to any questions the characters might have. The commander imparts the following information:

- Following the death of Emperor Xavan, **Prince Xeleth** has declared that his coronation will take place after the emperor's funeral.
- **Princess Xedalli** is being forced to attend her brother's coronation, even though it is the wish of many to see Xedalli and Xeleth coronated jointly, in accordance with their father's wishes.
- If he becomes emperor, Xeleth will have the characters executed without a trial.

#### Infiltrating the Citadel

If the characters arrive at the citadel in their own ship, they can tell from a distance that the imperial docks are guarded, but the common docks are not.

#### Landing at the Common Docks

If they land at the common docks, the characters can disembark and enter the city without being seen by guards.

#### Landing at the Imperial Docks

If the characters land at the imperial docks or try to enter the citadel by any other method (such as rappelling down on ropes over the middle of the city), they are immediately confronted by Commander Corelleth's squad (see above), which tries to capture them and escort them to the Temple of Light.

#### Exploring the City

Characters who avoid or escape the attention of their escorts can move about the citadel as they see fit. Most of the city's inhabitants are too preoccupied with the emperor's funeral and **Prince Xeleth**'s imminent coronation to take notice of the party. Any locals the characters talk to quickly turn the conversation to this topic, encouraging the party to get to the temple quickly before all the best vantage points are taken. The funeral for Emperor Xavan is a lengthy ceremony, which provides the characters with an opportunity to take a short rest before the final showdown in the Temple of Light.

### Temple of Light

The interior of the Temple of Light is large enough to accommodate dozens of people, while hundreds more gather outside.

![Temple of Light](img/adventure/LoX/044-map-12.03-cathedral-of-light.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/LoX/045-map-12.03-cathedral-of-light-player.webp)
#### Entering the Temple

As the characters enter the temple, read:

>>Pushing your way into the temple through the crowd of onlookers, you see an elf priest presiding over the figure of the late emperor, whose body floats in an azure pool with a brilliant beam of light penetrating it from above. Flanking the priest are **Prince Xeleth** and **Princess Xedalli**. The prince is arrayed in regal splendor, his expression one of exultation, while Xedalli stands stiffly, regarding her brother with a look of utter loathing.
>>
>>Silence fills the temple as the priest raises his arms and the emperor's body, shrouded in light, rises into the beam and disappears.
>>
>>"The emperor has ascended!" the priest announces. "His spirit is one with the light of Xaryxis. As his firstborn heirs, **Prince Xeleth** and **Princess Xedalli** are both in line to rule, but **Princess Xedalli** stands accused of treason. Are there any who would defend her claim?"
>>

**Prince Xeleth** is a chaotic evil **astral elf aristocrat** with a *ring of shooting stars*. **Princess Xedalli** is a chaotic neutral **astral elf aristocrat**. If Xedalli died previously, the figure standing here is a clone (created using a *clone* spell). Also present is Andavier, a lawful neutral **astral elf star priest**, who is overseeing Emperor Xavan's ascension. Watching from the perimeter of the room are twelve **astral elf honor guards** of various alignments. See *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for the *astral elves' stat blocks*.

If the characters don't speak up, Xedalli tries to mount her own defense, accusing her brother of trying to get rid of her and then fabricating the story of her sedition. It is obvious her words do not move the crowd, however. When Xeleth then tells of finding her engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow him, the crowd boos Xedalli and calls for Xeleth to be crowned emperor. Xedalli, in desperation, demands a chance to prove her innocence in a trial by combatÃ¢ÂÂa request that Xeleth mocks:

>>"Only someone who bears one of the starlight rings can challenge for the right to rule," says the prince. "Where is your ring, dear sister?"
>>

If she has entrusted her *ring of shooting stars* to the characters, Xedalli points in their direction, causing all eyes in the temple to fall upon them.

If the characters don't have the ring or refuse to present it, Xedalli loses her claim to the throne. Xeleth laughs, after which Andavier declares, "Xeleth is the rightful heir!" Skip ahead to the "All Hail Emperor Xeleth!" section.

#### Defending Xedalli

If the characters show that they have Xedalli's ring, they are entitled to defend the princess's claim to the throne. **Prince Xeleth** is irritated and tries to refute their arguments. You can run this scenario as a tense series of verbal thrusts and parries, with Xedalli prompting the characters as needed to recount the various episodes of their mission and their grievances against the Xaryxian Empire, while Xeleth attempts to twist every point against them. Resolve this debate by having one of the charactersÃ¢ÂÂwhichever one is leading the argument in favor of Xedalli's claim to the throneÃ¢ÂÂmake a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If another skill seems more appropriate, use that skill instead. If the character's argument is genuinely persuasive or if other characters contribute to the argument, the check is made with advantage. If the check succeeds, the crowd is swayed in Xedalli's favor. If the check fails, the crowd is not swayed, which pleases Xeleth.

If the characters fail to convince the crowd of Xedalli's innocence, Xedalli resorts to challenging her brother to a trial by combat. If the characters turn the crowd's opinion against the prince, it is instead Xeleth who, seeing his status in danger, challenges Xedalli to combat. In either case, proceed to the "Trial by Combat" section.

If the characters attack Xeleth or otherwise try to rescue Xedalli by force, they find themselves up against overwhelming odds. Xeleth uses Starlight Step and *fly* to evade their attacks, while the imperial guards do their best to subdue and apprehend the characters. If the characters are captured, Xeleth promises to have them executed as soon as the coronation is over. In the unlikely event that the party defeats Xeleth or drives him off, skip ahead to the "All Hail Emperor Xedalli!" section.

#### Astral Font

The Astral Font is a 40-foot-diameter, 2-foot-deep pool of glowing, pale liquid fed by a 10-foot-diameter beam of harmless blue light, which streams down from an aperture in the ceiling 175 feet above. The Astral Font has the following magical properties:

- **Star Beam.** A creature that ends its turn in the beam of light is magically teleported to the radiant core of Xaryxis, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. (The **zodar** is immune to this effect.) A creature that enters the star or starts its turn there takes 132 (24d10) radiant damage.
- **Starlight Spellcasting.** Water removed from the Astral Font glows faintly for 24 hours, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. A spellcaster who quaffs an ounce or more of the glowing water must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 24 (7d6) psychic damage. On a successful save, the creature gains the ability to cast one spell of their choice from the cleric spell list or the wizard spell list. The chosen spell, which must be of 7th level or lower, uses the caster's spellcasting ability and requires no material components. Once the spell is cast, it fades from memory. A creature can gain only one such spell at a time and can't benefit from drinking the pool's water more than once every 24 hours.

### Trial by Combat

Xedalli asks the characters to serve as her champions. If the characters accept, read:

>>Xeleth sneers. "Very well, sister, since you won't face me yourself, I, too, name a champion. Bring forth the zodar!"
>>
>>The crowd gives out a collective gasp as the guards part ranks to make way for a creature clad head to toe in a suit of obsidian armor. As it floats toward you, you realize the armor *is* the creature.
>>
>>The priest turns to face you. "The zodar has served the imperial family since the dawn of the empire. Its knowledge is vast, and its will is absolute. To the death!"
>>

The characters must fight the **zodar** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) on their own. See "Running the Zodar" below for more information about this creature.

The characters win the trial by combat if they reduce the zodar to 0 hit points. The zodar wins the battle if all the characters are at 0 hit points at the start of the zodar's turn or if the characters who are still standing concede defeat. The characters forfeit the match if any of them leaves the temple.

Xeleth, Xedalli, and Andavier move to the sidelines for their own safety, protected by royal guards. The audience also moves as far back as they can while preserving their front-row views of the battle.

#### Xedalli's Favor

If the characters swayed the crowd in favor of **Princess Xedalli**, the princess leads the crowd in a chant before the battle begins. This uplifting tribute grants 20 *temporary hit points* to each of her champions.

#### Running the Zodar

The zodar tries to knock characters unconscious instead of killing them. A character reduced to 0 hit points by the zodar is stable at 0 hit points. (The zodar saves its *wish* spell for the next chapter.)

If the zodar is reduced to 0 hit points, it slumps in place, apparently inert.

#### Aftermath

This chapter's cliffhanger ending depends on who wins the trial by combat.

#### All Hail Emperor Xeleth!

If the characters are defeated by the zodar (as described earlier in the chapter) or fail to come to Xedalli's defense, read:

>>The crowd chants, "All hail Emperor Xeleth!"
>>
>>Xeleth glowers at you. "Pathetic fools. Hurling yourselves into the void without the slightest inkling of who or what is out here. If you knew anything about the true nature of Wildspace, anything at all, you would have hidden from it in terror. Pity I can't destroy your world more than once."
>>

*Here ends chapter 11.*

#### All Hail Emperor Xedalli!

If the characters are triumphant, read:

>>The priest's voice rings throughout the temple. "The zodar is defeated! All hail Emperor Xedalli!"
>>
>>Xeleth lets out a strangled cry as his sister steps toward you, a wide smile on her face. "My ring, if you please."
>>

If the characters return Xedalli's *ring of shooting stars*, she slides it onto her finger, clenches her fist, and gazes at the ring lovingly. If the characters refuse to return her ring or claim not to have it, she frowns and says, "No matter."

Whether or not Xedalli gets her ring back, she knows the characters' mission poses a threat to Xaryxispace (as explained in the next chapter) and concludes that the characters have outlived their usefulness. Read:

>>"As emperor, I must reward my champions for this triumph." Abruptly, Xedalli's smile turns into a sneer. "Guards, seize them!"
>>

*Here ends chapter 11.*

## Chapter 12: Light of Xaryxis

>>*The Xaryxian Empire bombarded the characters' world with astral seeds, which sprouted into crystal vines that began harvesting the planet's energy. Determined to save their world, the characters fought their way to the imperial citadel orbiting Xaryxis, where the next emperor of the Xaryxian Empire was declared*!
>>

Regardless of which siblingÃ¢ÂÂXeleth or XedalliÃ¢ÂÂascends to the Xaryxian throne, the new emperor orders the execution of the characters. Before that can happen, the **zodar** intervenes on the party's behalf, using its *wish* spell to restore the characters to full health.

### Dying Wish

If the zodar was reduced to 0 hit points in the previous chapter's trial by combat, it regains 1 hit point now. At the same time, any unconscious characters regain 1 hit point and wake up. If the characters did not engage in the trial by combat, the zodar floats into view immediately after either Xeleth or Xedalli is hailed as the new emperor.

Unknown to Xeleth or Xedalli, the zodar was tasked by a previous emperor to help bring about the empire's destruction if ever someone of corrupt heart ascended to the throne. The zodar believes that time has finally come. Read the following:

>>A resounding, supernal voice issues from the zodar, astonishing everyone. "TAKE THE RING OF STARS INTO THE HEART OF THE STAR WHERE IT WAS FORGED, AND YOUR WORLD WILL BE SAVED." At this pronouncement, golden light spills from the zodar's eyes and washes over you. The zodar then crumbles into dust.
>>

As a result of the zodar's *wish*, the characters regain all their hit points. Each character also receives the benefit of a *greater restoration* spell. Seeing the characters invigorated in this way causes all the astral elves in the Temple of Light, including Xeleth and Xedalli, to wonder if the gods have forsaken them. Why else, as they see it, would the zodar, which has defended the royal family for eons, bestow such a gift on the empire's enemies?

The zodar's pronouncement tells the characters what they must do to save their world: hurl Xeleth's or Xedalli's *ring of shooting stars* into the heart of Xaryxis. Doing so not only destroys the star but also kills off the crystal vines threatening the characters' world.

Depending on how the previous chapter played out, the characters might have Xedalli's ring in their possession. If not, they will need to acquire that ring or obtain its twin, which is worn by Xeleth.

#### Obtaining a Ring

Andavier knows what will happen if the characters do as the zodar commands and makes these consequences known to everyone within earshot:

>>"Hurling a royal ring into the heart of Xaryxis will destroy the star and everything within one hundred million miles of it! That which survives will be plunged into darkness!"
>>

Andavier orders the audience to evacuate the Temple of Light. The priest leads the exodus, leaving the characters and their allies alone with Xeleth, Xedalli, and the siblings' royal guards.

Xeleth and Xedalli are **astral elf aristocrats**, and at least Xeleth has his *ring of shooting stars*. Twelve **astral elf honor guards** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie* for their stat blocks) stand ready to defend whichever sibling was named emperor in the previous chapter.

Whichever sibling was declared emperor in the previous chapter orders the guards to attack the characters, using the distraction to try to summon a solar dragon before joining the fray. Meanwhile, the other sibling casts *fly* and tries to flee the temple.

### Life or Death

When the characters have at least one *ring of shooting stars* in their custody, they must decide whether to destroy Xaryxis (to save their world and others like it) or to spare it (thus sealing their world's doom). If the characters seek the counsel of allies, use the following information to guide those conversations:

- **Commodore Krux.** The giff is adamant that Xaryxis be destroyed. He reminds the characters of the many worlds the Xaryxian Empire has wiped out of existence.
- **Flinch.** The hadozee recommends mercy for the astral elves. Flinch explains that his concern is not for the people of Xaryxispace but for the characters, because he has seen how the desire for revenge can bring great souls lowÃ¢ÂÂa remark that shames Krux into silence.
- **Grimzod Gargenhale.** Grimzod heartily endorses the destruction of Xaryxis, insisting that the astral elves have that and worse coming to them.
- **Starbough.** The destruction of Xaryxis would end the lives of all the creatures in XaryxispaceÃ¢ÂÂan incalculable loss, in Starbough's estimation.
- **Topolah.** If blowing up the star is what it takes to save the characters' world, then **Topolah** is all for it. She also observes that the opportunity to witness the death of a star is a once-in-a-lifetime event.
- **Warwyck Blastimoff.** Warwyck reminds the characters that good soldiers have fought and died to give the characters this chance at saving their world. He hopes they'll follow through.

#### No Coming Back

![Xaryxis explodes!](img/adventure/LoX/046-12-003.xaryxis-explodes.webp)

To destroy Xaryxis, someone bearing Xeleth's or Xedalli's *ring of shooting stars* must travel into the heart of the star, either by ship (a three-day voyage) or via the Astral Font's light beam (see chapter 11). It is, everyone realizes, a journey from which there is no coming back.

If no characters volunteer for this mission, **Grimzod Gargenhale** does so. If the characters allow Grimzod to sacrifice himself, he says, "I hope you all appreciate the irony of a vampirate flying into the sun." He then entrusts his **crawling claw** to **Topolah**, saying, "Let it never be said that **Grimzod Gargenhale** failed to give a lovely lady a hand."

**Commodore Krux** is reluctant to entrust the *ring of shooting stars* to the vampirate. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Krux to let Gargenhale have the ring and make this doomsday trip. Once he has the ring, Gargenhale enters the Astral Font's light beam. Moments later, he disappears and is gone forever.

If a character enters the heart of Xaryxis, describe their final moments as follows:

>>Unfettered radiance tears through your flesh as you are pulled into the star's blinding core.
>>

#### Death of a Star

When Xaryxis is destroyed, read:

>>The star flares, becoming a thousand times brighter. Shock waves of multicolored energy expand outward from the collapsed star, threatening all in their path.
>>

The exploding star destroys everything within 100 million miles of it, including the planet Vaerduran. Rivus and Xaryndar survive but are plunged into darkness. The surviving astral elves have no choice but to evacuate all life from Xaryxispace over the coming weeks and months before retreating to the Astral Sea. Amid the chaos, the characters and their NPC allies have enough time to board a ship and use its spelljamming helm to flee the system.

## Conclusion

The characters' return voyage can be as eventful or uneventful as you like. As for the characters' world, its fate is inexorably bound with the fate of Xaryxis.

### Xaryxis Is Spared

If Xaryxis was not destroyed, the characters return home to find their world on the brink of annihilation. As the planet begins to fracture, the characters might decide to help evacuate and resettle survivors on the other worlds of their system.

### Xaryxis Is Destroyed

![The destruction of Xaryxis causes the crystal vines to crumble. The heroes have saved their world!](img/adventure/LoX/047-12-004.crystal-vines-crumble.webp)

If Xaryxis was destroyed, the characters return home to find that the crystal vines that were choking their world have shattered and collapsed. Among the world's inhabitants, shock at the sudden reprieve has given way to relief and jubilation.

The destruction of Xaryxis forces what's left of the Xaryxian Empire to take refuge in the Astral Sea, where the astral elves still have numerous ships and strongholds. Xeleth and Xedalli had one clone apiece, making it likely that at least one sibling will survive the adventure with a hunger for revenge.

## Further Adventures

This section provides a couple suggestions for how you can continue this campaign:

- **Beyond the Eye of Doom.** Is the Eye of Doom in Doomspace a gateway to a new Wildspace system? One or more NPCs encourage the characters to mount an expedition to discover what lies on the other side of the vortex.
- **Back to Bral.** If the characters return to the Rock of Bral, tales of their heroism travel quickly to the palace of Starhaven, where the characters are invited to meet Prince Andru. Perhaps the Bralian monarch has a quest for them!

*The end*...?
