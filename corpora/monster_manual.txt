INTRODUCTION
This is the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Roleplaying Game, the game
that defines the genre and has set the standard for fantasy roleplaying for more than 30 years.
Specifically, this is the Monster Manual. This book contains
entries for hundreds of creatures, both hostile and benign, for use
in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventures. This book, the Player’s Handbook, and the Dungeon Master’s Guide comprise the core rules for
the D&D® game.
This introduction explains how to read each creature’s write-up.
It often refers to the Glossary, located in Chapter 7 at the back of
this book (starting on page 305), for more details on attack forms
and the special qualities associated with monsters.
A list of monsters organized by Challenge Rating appears on
pages 318 and 319 to make it easy for the Dungeon Master to tailor
encounters to the party level of the player characters.
READING THE ENTRIES
Each monster description is organized in the same general format,
as outlined below. For complete information about the characteristics of monsters, consult Chapter 7: Glossary (starting on page
305), the Player’s Handbook, or the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
STATISTICS BLOCK
This portion of a monster description contains basic game information on the creature.
Name
This is the name by which the creature is generally known. The
descriptive text may provide other names.
Size and Type
This line describes the creature’s size (Huge, for example). Size categories are defined in the Glossary. A size modifier applies to the
creature’s Armor Class (AC) and attack bonus, as well as to certain
skills. A creature’s size also determines how far it can reach to
make a melee attack and how much space it occupies in a fight
(see Space/Reach, below).
The size and type line continues with the creature’s type (giant,
for example). Type determines how magic affects a creature; for
example, the hold animal spell affects only creatures of the animal
type. Type determines certain features, such as Hit Dice size, base
attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, and skill points. For
quick reference, the Glossary gives a full description of the features and traits of each type and subtype.
Hit Dice
This line gives the creature’s number and type of Hit Dice, and
lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives the average
hit points for a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice.
A creature’s Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing,
and its maximum ranks in a skill.
Initiative
This line gives the creature’s modifier on initiative checks.
Speed
This line gives the creature’s tactical speed on land (the amount of
distance it can cover in one move action). If the creature wears
armor that reduces its speed, the creature’s base land speed follows.
If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given
after (or in place of ) the land speed. Unless noted otherwise,
modes of movement are natural (not magical). See the Glossary for
information on movement modes.
Armor Class
The Armor Class line gives the creature’s AC for normal combat
and includes a parenthetical mention of the modifiers contributing to it (usually size, Dexterity, and natural armor). The creature’s
touch and flat-footed ACs follow the combat-ready AC.
A creature’s armor proficiencies (if it has any) depend on its
type, but in general a creature is automatically proficient with any
kind of armor it is described as wearing (light, medium, or heavy),
and with all lighter kinds of armor.
Base Attack/Grapple
The number before the slash on this line is the creature’s base
attack bonus (before any modifiers are applied). The DM usually
won’t need this number, but it can be handy sometimes, especially
if the creature has the Power Attack or Combat Expertise feats.
The number after the slash is the creature’s grapple bonus, which

is used when the creature makes a grapple attack or when someone
tries to grapple the creature. The grapple bonus includes all modifiers that apply to the creature’s grapple checks (base attack bonus,
Strength modifier, special size modifier, and any other applicable
modifier, such as a racial bonus on grapple checks).
Attack
This line shows the single attack the creature makes with an attack
action. In most cases, this is also the attack the creature uses when
making an attack of opportunity as well. The attack line provides
the weapon used (natural or manufactured), attack bonus, and
form of attack (melee or ranged). The attack bonus given includes
modifications for size and Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with the Weapon Finesse feat
can use its Dexterity modifier on melee attacks.
If the creature uses natural attacks, the natural weapon given
here is the creature’s primary natural weapon (see the Glossary).
If the creature has several different weapons at its disposal, the
alternatives are shown, with each different attack separated by the
word “or.”
A creature can use one of its secondary natural weapons (see the
Glossary) when making an attack action, but if it does it takes an
attack penalty, as noted in the Full Attack section below.
The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically.
Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.
Full Attack
This line shows all the physical attacks the creature makes when it
uses a full-round action to make a full attack. It gives the number of
attacks along with the weapon, attack bonus, and form of attack (melee
or ranged). The first entry is for the creature’s primary weapon, with an
attack bonus including modifications for size and Strength (for melee
attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with the Weapon
Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on melee attacks.
The remaining weapons are secondary, and attacks with them
are made with a –5 penalty to the attack roll, no matter how many
there are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat (see page 304) take
only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.
The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically.
Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.
A creature’s primary attack damage includes its full Strength
modifier (1-1/2 times its Strength bonus if the attack is with the
creature’s sole natural weapon) and is given first. Secondary
attacks add only 1/2 the creature’s Strength bonus and are given
second in the parentheses.
If any attacks also have some special effect other than damage
(poison, disease, energy drain, and so forth), that information is
given here.
Unless noted otherwise, creatures using natural weapons deal
double damage on critical hits.
Manufactured Weapons: Creatures that use swords, bows,
spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters do. The
bonus for attacks with two-handed weapons is 1-1/2 times the
creature’s Strength modifier (if it is a bonus), and is given first. Offhand weapons add only 1/2 the Strength bonus and are given
second in the parentheses.
Space/Reach
This line describes how much space the creature takes up on the
battle grid and thereby needs to fight effectively, as well as how
close it has to be to threaten an opponent. The number before the
slash is the creature’s space, or how many feet one side of the creature occupies (refer to the Dungeon Master’s Guide for additional
details). For example, a creature with a space of 15 feet occupies a
3-square-by-3-square space on the battle grid. The number after
the slash is the creature’s natural reach. If the creature has exceptional reach due to a weapon, tentacle, or the like, the extended
reach and its source are noted in parentheses at the end of the line.
Special Attacks and Special Qualities
Many creatures have unusual abilities, which can include special
attack forms, resistance or vulnerability to certain types of
damage, and enhanced senses, among others. A monster entry
breaks these abilities into special attacks and special qualities. The
latter category includes defenses, vulnerabilities, and other special
abilities that are not modes of attack. A special ability is either
extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su). See the
Glossary for definitions of special abilities. Additional information (when needed) is provided in the creature’s descriptive text.
When a special ability allows a saving throw, the kind of save
and the save DC is noted in the descriptive text. Most saving
throws against special abilities have DCs calculated as follows: 10
+ 1/2 the attacker’s racial Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier.
The save DC is given in the creature’s description along with the
ability on which the DC is based.
Saves
This line gives the creature’s Fortitude, Reflex, and Will save modifiers.
Abilities
This line lists the creature’s ability scores, in the customary order:
Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Except where noted otherwise, each
INTRODUCTION
WHY A REVISION?
The new DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game debuted in 2000. In the three years
since the d20 game system energized the RPG industry, we’ve gathered
tons of data on how the game is being played. We consider D&D to be
a living game that constantly evolves as it is played. Using the gathered
feedback, we’ve retooled the game from the ground up and incorporated everyone’s suggestions to improve the game and this product.
If this is your first experience with D&D, we welcome you to a
wonderful world of adventure and imagination. If you played the
prior version of this book, rest assured that this revision is a testament to our dedication to continuous product improvement and
innovation. We’ve updated errata, clarified rules, polished the presentation, and made the game better than it was. This is an upgrade
of the d20 System, not a new edition of the game. This revision is
compatible with existing products, and these products can be used
with the revision with only minor adjustments.
What’s new in the revised Monster Manual? The entire book has been
polished and refined, all in response to your feedback and to reflect the
way the game is actually being played. We’ve reorganized the group
monster entries into easier-to-use, single-entry formats. New monsters
have been added to this larger book. Advanced versions of some
monsters have been included to challenge higher-level characters. New
monster feats have been added, and all monster abilities are detailed in
the glossary for easy reference. Monsters that can be used as player
characters have level adjustments and other information to expedite
such play, and we’ve reworked all monsters so that they gain feats and
skills the same way that player characters do. We’ve added extensive
information on how to advance, customize, and design monsters. And
there are other improvements throughout, such as first-glance descriptions of monsters, typical spell lists for spellcasting monsters, additional statistics to speed up play (including grapple bonus and full
attack routines), and ready-to-play entries for all monster types.
Take a look, play the game. We think you’ll like how everything

creature is assumed to have the standard array of ability scores
before racial adjustments (all 11s and 10s). To determine any creature’s racial ability adjustments, subtract 10 from any even-numbered ability score and subtract 11 from any odd-numbered score.
(Exceptions are noted in the Combat section of a creature’s descriptive text.) Humanoid warriors are generally built using the nonelite
array: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. Advanced creatures (such as the hound
archon hero) are built using the elite array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Most abilities work as described in Chapter 1 of the Player’s
Handbook, with exceptions given below.
Strength: As noted on page 162 of the Player’s Handbook, quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipeds can. Any creature with
four or more motive limbs can carry a load as a quadruped, even if
it does not necessarily use all the limbs at once. For example, dragons carry loads as quadrupeds.
Intelligence: A creature can speak all the languages mentioned
in its description, plus one additional language per point of Intelligence bonus. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or
higher understands at least one language (Common, unless noted
otherwise).
Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores. These
creatures do not have an ability score of 0—they lack the ability
altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects of
nonabilities are detailed in the Glossary.
Skills
This line gives the creature’s skills, along with each skill’s modifier
(including adjustments for ability scores, armor check penalties,
and any bonuses from feats or racial traits). All listed skills are
class skills, unless the creature has a character class (noted in the
entry). A creature’s type and Intelligence score determine the
number of skill points it has.
The Skills section of the creature’s description recaps racial
bonuses and other adjustments to skill modifiers for the sake of
clarity; these bonuses should not be added to the listed skill modifiers. An asterisk (*) beside the relevant score and in the Skills section of the descriptive text indicates a conditional adjustment, one
that applies only in certain situations (for instance, a gargoyle gets
an additional +8 bonus on Hide checks when it is concealed
against a background of worked stone).
Natural Tendencies: Some creatures simply aren’t made for
certain types of physical activity. Elephants, despite their great
Strength scores, are terrible at jumping. Giant crocodiles, despite
their high Strength scores, don’t climb well. Horses can’t walk
tightropes. If it seems clear to you that a particular creature simply
is not made for a particular physical activity, you can say that the
creature takes a –8 penalty on skill checks that defy its natural tendencies. In extreme circumstances (a porpoise attempting a Climb
check, for instance) you can rule that the creature fails the check
automatically.
Feats
The line gives the creature’s feats. A monster gains feats just as a
character does—one for its first Hit Die, a second feat if it has at
least 3 HD, and an additional feat for every additional 3 HD. (For
example, a 9 HD creature is entitled to four feats.)
Sometimes a creature has one or more bonus feats, marked with
a superscript B (B). Creatures often do not have the prerequisites
for a bonus feat. If this is so, the creature can still use the feat. If
you wish to customize the creature with new feats, you can reassign its other feats, but not its bonus feats. A creature cannot have
a feat that is not a bonus feat unless it has the feat’s prerequisites.
Environment
This line gives a type of climate and terrain where the creature is
typically found. This describes a tendency, but is not exclusionary.
A great wyrm gold dragon, for instance, has an environment entry
of warm plains, but could also be encountered underground, in
cold hills, or even on another plane of existence. See Chapter 3 of
the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more on terrain types and climate.
Organization
This line describes the kinds of groups the creature might form. A
range of numbers in parentheses indicates how many combatready adults are in each type of group. Many groups also have a
number of noncombatants, expressed as a percentage of the fighting population. Noncombatants can include young, the infirm,
slaves, or other individuals who are not inclined to fight. A creature’s Society section may include more details on noncombatants.
If the organization line contains the term “domesticated,” the
creature is generally found only in the company of other creatures, whom it serves in some capacity.
Challenge Rating
This shows the average level of a party of adventurers for which
one creature would make an encounter of moderate difficulty.
Assume a party of four fresh characters (full hit points, full spells,
and equipment appropriate to their levels). Given reasonable luck,
the party should be able to win the encounter with some damage
but no casualties. For more information about Challenge Ratings,
see pages 36 and 48 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Treasure
This line reflects how much wealth the creature owns and refers
to Table 3–5: Treasure on page 52 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. In
most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has
no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own
useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry and
use these, leaving bulky items at home. See the glossary for more
details on using the Treasure line of each monster entry.
Alignment
This line gives the alignment that the creature is most likely to
have. Every entry includes a qualifier that indicates how broadly
that alignment applies to the species as a whole. See the Glossary
for details.
Advancement
This book usually describes only the most commonly encountered version of a creature (though some entries for advanced
monsters can be found). The advancement line shows how tough
a creature can get, in terms of extra Hit Dice. (This is not an
absolute limit, but exceptions are extremely rare.) Often, intelligent creatures advance by gaining a level in a character class
instead of just gaining a new Hit Die.
Level Adjustment
This line is included in the entries of creatures suitable for use as
player characters or as cohorts (usually creatures with Intelligence
scores of at least 3 and possessing opposable thumbs). Add this
number to the creature’s total Hit Dice, including class levels, to
get the creature’s effective character level (ECL). A character’s ECL
affects the experience the character earns, the amount of experience the character must have before gaining a new level, and the
character’s starting equipment. See pages 172, 199, and 209 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide for more information.
DESCRIPTIVE TEXT
The body of each entry opens with a sentence or two that
describes what the player characters might see on first encountering a monster, followed by a short description of the creature:
what it does, what it looks like, and what is most noteworthy
about it. Special sections describe how the creature fights and give
details on special attacks, special qualities, skills, and feats.

CHAPTER 1:
MONSTERS A TO Z
This book contains hundreds of creatures for use in any DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS game. Refer to the Glossary, starting on page 305, for
definitions of common features and abilities of individual monsters. In most cases, a monster entry describes a typical individual
of the kind in question, which is the most common version encountered by characters on adventures. The DM can modify these
entries, create advanced or weaker versions, or alter any statistics
to play a monster against type and surprise the player characters.
And now, let’s meet the monsters. . . .
ABOLETH
The cool, refreshing water suddenly erupts in a storm of reaching, grasping tentacles. The tentacles connect to a primeval fish, 20 feet in length
from its bulbous head to its crescent-shaped tail. Three slit-shaped eyes,
protected by bony ridges, are set one atop the other in the front of its head,
which remains just beneath the surface as it attacks.
The aboleth is a revolting fishlike amphibian found primarily in
subterranean lakes and rivers. It despises all nonaquatic creatures
and attempts to destroy them on sight.
An aboleth has a pink belly. Four pulsating blueblack orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease.
It uses its tail for propulsion in the water
and drags itself along with its tentacles on land. An aboleth weighs
about 6,500 pounds.
Aboleths are cruel and
highly intelligent, making them dangerous predators. They know many ancient and terrible
secrets, for they inherit their parents’ knowledge at birth and assimilate the memories of
all they consume.
Aboleths are smart enough to refrain
from immediately attacking land dwellers
who draw near. Instead they hang back,
hoping their prey will enter the water, which
they often make appear cool, clear, and refreshing with their
powers of illusion. Aboleths also use their psionic abilities to
enslave individuals for use against their own companions.
Aboleths have both male and female reproductive organs. They
breed in solitude, laying 1d3 eggs every five years. These eggs grow
for another five years before hatching into full-grown aboleths.
Although the young are physically mature, they remain with their
parent for some ten years, obeying the older creature utterly.
Aboleths speak their own language, as well as Undercommon
and Aquan.
COMBAT
An aboleth attacks by flailing with its long, slimy tentacles,
though it prefers to fight from a distance using its illusion powers.
Enslave (Su): Three times per day, an aboleth can attempt to
enslave any one living creature within 30 feet. The target must
succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 16th). An enslaved creature obeys the
aboleth’s telepathic commands until freed by remove curse, and can
attempt a new Will save every 24 hours to break free. The control
is also broken if the aboleth dies or travels more than 1 mile from
its slave. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Psionics (Sp): At will—hypnotic pattern (DC 15), illusory wall (DC
17), mirage arcana (DC 18), persistent image (DC 18), programmed
image (DC 19), project image (DC 20), veil (DC 19). Effective caster
level 16th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Slime (Ex): A blow from an aboleth’s tentacle can cause a terrible affliction. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 19
Fortitude save or begin to transform over the next 1d4+1 minutes,
the skin gradually becoming a clear, slimy membrane. An afflicted
creature must remain moistened with cool, fresh water or take
1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. The slime reduces the
creature’s natural armor bonus by 1 (but never to less than 0). The
save DC is Constitution-based.
A remove disease spell cast before the transformation is complete
will restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward, however,
only a heal or mass heal spell can reverse the affliction.
Mucus Cloud (Ex): An aboleth underwater surrounds itself
with a viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature
coming into contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or lose the ability to breathe air for
the next 3 hours. An affected creature suffocates in 2d6 minutes if
removed from the water. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud
and failing another Fortitude save continues the effect for
another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Skills: An aboleth has a +8 racial bonus on any
Swim check to perform some special action or
avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take
10 on a Swim check, even if distracted
or endangered. It can use the
run action while swimming, provided it swims
in a straight line.
ABOLETH MAGE
Among the watery tombs and dungeons they inhabit, the lords of
the aboleths focus their efforts to achieve dominion through their
study of wizardry. Their great power marks them as among the
lords of all subterranean creatures. Still, these creatures, devoted
to their arcane scholarship, spend most of their long lives alone.
Combat
The save DC for the aboleth mage’s transformation tentacle
attack (DC 21) and its mucus cloud (DC 21) are adjusted for its
higher Constitution score. The save DC for its enslave ability
(DC 16) is adjusted for its lower Charisma score, as are the save
DCs for its psionic abilities: Hypnotic pattern (DC 14), illusory wall
(DC 16), mirage arcana (DC 17), persistent image (DC 17), programmed image (DC 18), project image (DC 19), veil (DC 18). Effective caster level 16th.
The aboleth mage uses a number of spells, such as displacement,
greater invisibility, and wall of force, to protect itself while seizing
control of its foes with spells and innate abilities.
Typical Wizard Spells Prepared (4/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 15 + spell
level): 0—daze, detect magic (2), resistance; 1st—alarm, charm person,
color spray, mage armor, magic missile (2); 2nd—blur, bull’s strength,
darkness, fox’s cunning, see invisibilty; 3rd—dispel magic, displacement,

Achaierai 9
A large creature stands on four stiltlike legs. It has
a birdlike body, round and plump, about the size
of a small pony, balanced atop its legs. Feathers
that range in color from brown to red cover its
body, and its terrible claws and beak glint like
burnished metal.
Achaierais are massive, 15-foot-tall flightless birds that inhabit the plane of
Acheron and are only occasionally
encountered elsewhere. They are
evil, clever, and predatory, with a distinct taste for torture.
Achaierais speak Infernal. They weigh
about 750 pounds.
COMBAT
In close combat, an achaierai lashes
out with two of its four legs and snaps
with its powerful beak. It makes frequent use of its Spring Attack feat
to strike quickly and then retreat
out of range before an enemy can
counterattack.
An achaierai’s natural weapons,
as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawfulaligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Black Cloud (Ex): Up to three times per day
an achaierai can release a choking, toxic black cloud.
Those other than achaierai within 10 feet instantly take 2d6
points of damage. They must also succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
save or be affected for 3 hours as though by an insanity spell
(caster level 16th). The save DC is Constitution-based.

The creature that floats before you is like a thing out of nightmare. It has a
vaguely humanoid shape, but it’s a shape without features that has been
distorted and bristles with madness. From the waist down, it trails away into
vaporous nothingness, leaving a faint trace of fog behind it as it moves.
An allip is the spectral remains of
someone driven to suicide by a madness that afflicted it in life. It craves
only revenge and unrelentingly
pursues those who tormented it in
life and pushed it over the brink.
An allip cannot speak intelligibly.
COMBAT
An allip is unable to cause physical
harm, although it doesn’t appear to
know that. It keeps flailing away at
enemies, yet it inflicts no wounds.
Babble (Su): An allip constantly
mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must
succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be
affected as though by a hypnotism
spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic
mind-affecting compulsion effect.
Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip’s
babble for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Madness (Su): Anyone targeting
an allip with a thought detection,
mind control, or telepathic ability makes
direct contact with its tortured mind and
takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
Wisdom Drain (Su): An allip causes
1d4 points of Wisdom drain each time it
hits with its incorporeal touch attack. On
each such successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit
points.
ANGEL
Angels are a race of celestials, beings who live on the good-aligned
Outer Planes. Celestials positively drip with goodness—every fiber
of their bodies and souls is suffused with it. They are the natural enemies of demons and devils (creatures of the infernal realms).
Angels can be of any good alignment. Lawful good angels hail
from the plane of Celestia, neutral good angels from the plane of
Elysium or the Beastlands, and chaotic good angels from plane of
Arborea. Regardless of their alignment, angels never lie, cheat, or
steal. They are impeccably honorable in all their dealings and often
prove the most trustworthy and diplomatic of all the celestials.
All angels are blessed with comely looks, though their actual
appearances vary widely.
Angels speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, though they can
speak with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.
COMBAT
Though they are honorable and good, angels don’t hesitate to back
up their arguments with their weapons and other powers when
necessary. Though they do not relish combat, they do not hesitate
to take the battle to the enemy. In combat, most angels make full
use of their mobility and their ability to attack at a distance.
Angel Traits: An angel possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.
—Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.
— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.
—Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by
evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a
ALLIP
Allip
Illus. by B. Snoddy
10
+4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the
angel. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a
lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level
equals angel’s HD). This aura can be dispelled, but the angel can
create it again as a free action on its next turn. (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel’s statistics block.)
—Tongues (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a
language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to
angel’s Hit Dice). This ability is always active.

A beautiful, extremely tall, humanlike creature with long, feathery wings
and a very supple and lithe body glows with an inner power that makes
it hard to look directly at the creature.
Astral devas watch over lesser beings of good alignment and help
when they can. In particular, they are patrons of planar travelers
and powerful creatures undertaking good causes.
An astral deva is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.
Combat
An astral deva is not afraid to enter melee combat. It takes a
fierce joy in bashing evil foes with its powerful +3 heavy mace
of disruption.
An astral deva’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—aid, continual flame, detect evil,
discern lies (DC 19), dispel evil (DC 20), dispel magic, holy aura (DC
23), holy smite (DC 19), holy word (DC 22), invisibility (self only),

Stun (Su): If an astral deva strikes an opponent twice in one
round with its mace, that creature must succeed on a DC 22
Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
Strength-based.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex): An astral deva retains its Dexterity
bonus to AC when flat-footed, and it cannot be flanked except by
a rogue of at least 16th level. It can flank characters with the
uncanny dodge ability as if it were a 12th-level rogue.

The creature resembles a massively muscular and tall human with smooth
emerald skin, white-feathered wings, and a bald head.
Planetars serve as mighty generals of celestial armies. They also
help powerful mortals on missions of good, particularly those that
involve battles with fiends. A planetar is nearly 9 feet tall and
weighs about 500 pounds.
Combat
Despite their vast array of magical powers, planetars are likely to
wade into melee with their +3 greatswords. They particularly enjoy
fighting fiends.
A planetar’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

The creature resembles a
towering, powerfully built
human with brilliant topaz
eyes, silvery (or golden) skin,
and gleaming white wings.
Solars are the greatest of the
angels, usually close
attendants to a deity or
champions of some
cosmically beneficent task (such
as eliminating a
particular type of
wrongdoing).
A solar has a deep
and commanding voice, and
stands about 9 feet tall. It
weighs about 500 pounds.
Combat
Solars are puissant champions
of good. Only the most powerful fiends approach their power.
Even more fearsome than their
+5 dancing greatswords are their +2
composite longbows that create any
sort of slaying arrow when drawn.
A solar’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned and
epic for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Regeneration (Ex): A solar takes normal
damage from epic evil-aligned weapons,

ANIMATED OBJECT
Animated objects come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They
owe their existence as creatures to spells such as animate objects
or similar supernatural abilities.
COMBAT
Animated objects fight only as directed by the animator.
They follow orders without question and to the best of their
abilities. Since they do not need to breathe and never tire,
they can be extremely capable minions.
An animated object can have one or more of the following
special abilities, depending on its form.
Blind (Ex): A sheetlike animated object such as a
carpet or tapestry can grapple an opponent up to three
sizes larger than itself. The object makes a
normal grapple check. If it wins, it
wraps itself around the opponent’s
head, causing that creature to be
blinded until removed.
Constrict (Ex): A flexible animated object such as a rope,
vine, or rug deals damage equal to its slam damage value plus 1-
1/2 times its Strength bonus with a successful grapple
check against a creature up to one size larger
than itself.
An object of at least Large size can
make constriction attacks against multiple creatures at once, if they all are at
least two sizes smaller than the object
and can fit under it.
Hardness (Ex): An animated object
has the same hardness it had before it was
animated (see Table 9–9 and Table 9–11,
page 166 of the Player’s Handbook, for the
hardness of some common substances and
objects).
Improved Speed (Ex): The base land speed
given in the statistics block assume that an animated object lurches, rocks, or slithers along.
Objects with two legs (statues, ladders) or a similar
shape that allows faster movement have a +10
foot bonus to speed. Objects with multiple legs (tables, chairs) have a +20 foot
bonus to speed. Wheeled objects have
a +40 foot bonus to speed.
Objects might have additional modes
of movement. A wooden object can float
and has a swim speed equal to half its land
speed. A rope or similar sinuous object has a climb
speed equal to half its land speed. A sheetlike
object can fly (clumsy maneuverability) at
half its normal speed.
Trample (Ex): An animated object
of at least Large size and with a hardness of at least 10 can trample creatures two or more sizes smaller than
itself, dealing damage equal to the
object’s slam damage + 1-1/2 times its
Strength bonus. Opponents who do not

An ankheg burrows with legs and mandibles. A burrowing
ankheg usually does not make a usable tunnel, but can construct
a tunnel; it burrows at half speed when it does so. It often digs a
winding tunnel up to 40 feet below the surface in the rich soil of
forests or farmlands. The tunnel is 5 feet tall and wide, and from 60
to 150 feet long ([1d10 + 5] × 10). The hollowed ends of the tunnel
serve as temporary lairs for sleeping, eating, or hibernating.
An ankheg can eat decayed organic matter but prefers fresh
meat. Though a hungry ankheg might kill a farmer, the creature is
quite beneficial to farmland. Its tunnel system laces the soil with
passages for air and water, while its wastes add rich nutrients.
COMBAT
An ankheg usually lies 5 to 10 feet below the
surface until its antennae detect
the approach of prey. It
then burrows up to
attack. (Treat this as a
charge, even though
the ankheg does not
need to move 10 feet
before attacking.)
Clusters of ankhegs share the
same territory but
do not cooperate. If
several attack, each
tries to grab a different foe. If
there aren’t enough targets,
two might grab the
same creature in a
tug-of-war.
Improved
Grab (Ex): To
use this ability, an
ankheg must hit with
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the ankheg is damaged after grabbing its prey, it retreats backward down its tunnel at
its land speed (not its burrow speed), dragging the victim with it.
Spit Acid (Ex): 30-ft. line, once every 6 hours; damage 4d4
acid, Reflex DC 14 half. One such attack depletes the ankheg’s
acid supply for 6 hours. It cannot spit acid or deal acid damage
during this time. The save DC is Constitution-based.
An ankheg does not use this ability unless it is desperate or
frustrated. It most often spits acid when reduced to fewer than
half its full normal hit points or when it has not successfully
grabbed an opponent.

The creature appears to be a monstrous spider, but it has two small
humanlike arms below its mandibles.
An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous
powers. In its natural form, an aranea resembles a big spider, with
a humpbacked body a little bigger than a human torso. It has
fanged mandibles like a normal spider. Two small arms, each about
2 feet long, lie below the mandibles. Each arm has a hand with
four many-jointed fingers and a
double-jointed thumb.
An aranea weighs about 150
pounds. The hump on its back
houses its brain.
Araneas speak Common and
Sylvan.
COMBAT
An aranea avoids physical combat and uses its webs and
spells when it can. In
a battle, it tries to
immobilize or distract
the most aggressive
opponents first.
Araneas often
subdue opponents
for ransom.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Spells: An aranea casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer. It prefers
illusions and enchantments and avoids fire spells.
Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/6; save DC 12 + spell level): 0—
daze, detect magic, ghost sound, light, resistance; 1st—mage armor, silent
image, sleep.
Web (Ex): In spider or hybrid form (see below), an aranea
can throw a web up to six times per day. This is similar to an
attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a
range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of
up to Large size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing
no movement.
An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist
check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check
DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes
a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes
double damage from fire.
Change Shape (Su): An aranea’s natural form is that of a
Medium monstrous spider. It can assume two other forms. The
first is a unique Small or Medium humanoid; an aranea in its
humanoid form always assumes the same appearance and traits,
much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, an aranea
cannot use its bite attack, webs, or poison.
The second form is a Medium spider–humanoid hybrid. In
hybrid form, an aranea looks like a Medium humanoid at first
glance, but a DC 18 Spot check reveals the creature’s fangs and
spinnerets. The aranea retains its bite attack, webs, and poison
in this form, and can also wield weapons or wear armor. When in
hybrid form, an aranea’s speed is 30 feet (6 squares).
ARANEA
Ankheg
15
An aranea remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new
one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does an aranea
revert to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell, however,
reveals its natural form if it is in humanoid or hybrid form.
Skills: Araneas have a +2 racial bonus on Jump, Listen, and
Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and
can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks even if rushed or
threatened.
ARCHON
Archons are celestials from the plane of Celestia. They have
charged themselves with the protection of the plane, and also consider themselves guardians of all who are innocent or free of evil.
They are the natural enemies of fiends (creatures of the lower
planes), particularly demons.
Archons speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak
with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.
COMBAT
Archons never attack without provocation (though their overwhelming lawful goodness often makes them easily provoked).
They avoid harming other good creatures if they can, using nondamaging spells or weapon attacks that deal nonlethal damage if
possible. An angry archon can be vengeance itself, however, no
matter what the foe’s alignment is.
Archons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent
to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds
(usually by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and
engaging a foe with magic before moving into melee).
Archon Traits: An archon possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that
fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of
an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save
DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and
includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on
attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit
the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or
broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s
aura for 24 hours.
—Immunity to electricity and petrification.
— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.
—Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil
effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the
archon’s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are
not included in an archon’s statistics block.)
—Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the
spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only
itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.
—Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has
a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level 14th). This
ability is always active.

A ball of glowing light floats toward you.
Lantern archons appear as floating balls of light that glow about as
brightly as a torch. Only their destruction can extinguish the
glow, though they can try to hide it.
Lantern archons are very friendly and usually eager to give what
assistance they can. However, their bodies are just gaseous globes,
and they are much too weak to render any material aid. Lantern
archons speak in soft, musical voices.
Combat
A lantern archon has little reason to get within melee range. It
usually hovers just close enough to bring the enemy within its
aura of menace, then blasts away with its light rays. Lantern
archons prefer to concentrate on a single opponent, seeking to
reduce enemy numbers quickly.
Aura of Menace (Su): Will DC 12 negates.
Light Ray (Ex): A lantern archon’s light rays have a range of 30
feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—aid, detect evil, continual flame.
Caster level 3rd.
HOUND ARCHON
A powerfully built humanoid with the head of a dog appears both serene
and ready for action, with a greatsword strapped across its broad back and
an expression that indicates intelligence and protectiveness.
Hound archons look like well-muscled humans with canine
heads. They seek to defend the innocent and the helpless
against evil.
Their broad shoulders and meaty fists mark hound archons as
able combatants. Likewise, their strong legs indicate that fleeing
enemies won’t get very far.
ARCHON
16
Combat
Hound archons always fight with a will. They prefer to attack with
their natural weapons but occasionally use greatswords.
A hound archon’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as good-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—aid, continual flame, detect evil,
message. Caster level 6th.
Aura of Menace (Su): Will DC 16 negates.
Change Shape (Su): A hound archon can assume any canine
form of Small to Large size. While in canine form, the hound
archon loses its bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the
bite attack of the form it chooses. For the purposes of this ability,
canines include any doglike or wolflike animal of the animal type.
Skills: *While in canine form, a hound archon gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Hide and Survival checks.
HOUND ARCHON HERO
The hound archon hero is a mighty champion of justice, devoted
to the pursuit and destruction of evil in all its forms.
Combat
Hound archon heroes have over time developed a love for their
weapons. They prefer to use their holy greatswords over their bite
and slam attacks.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—aid, continual flame, detect evil,
message. Caster level 6th.
Aura of Menace (Su): The save DC for the hound archon hero’s
aura of menace (DC 18) is adjusted for its higher Charisma score.
Smite Evil (Su): Three times per day a hound archon hero can
make a normal melee attack with a +3 bonus that deals an extra 11
points of damage against an evil foe.
Change Shape (Su): A hound archon hero can assume any
canine form of Small to Large size. While in canine form, the hound
archon loses its bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite
attack of the form it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines
include any doglike or wolflike animal of the animal type.
Skills: *While in canine form, a hound archon hero gains a +4
circumstance bonus on Hide and Survival checks.
Paladin Abilities: Aura of courage, aura of good, detect evil,
divine grace, divine health, lay on hands (33 points/day), remove
disease 2/week, special mount (juvenile bronze dragon).
Typical Paladin Spells Prepared (2/2; save DC 12 + spell level): 1st—
divine favor, protection from evil; 2nd—bull’s strength, eagle’s splendor.
Possessions: +3 full plate armor, +2 cold iron greatsword.
Hound Archon Hero Mounts
In the course of their adventures, many hound archon heroes
befriend bronze dragons, which may come to serve as their
mounts. The relationship between these mounts and their celestial riders goes beyond even the special bond between paladin
and mount. The dragon and the archon are naturally allies and
friends, as can be expected of two powerful servants of cosmic
justice. The juvenile bronze dragon mount gains 2 additional HD,
4 points of Strength, an additional 4 points of natural armor,
improved evasion, and +10 feet to speed in all its movement
forms. The dragon cannot, however, command other creatures of
its type as other kinds of paladin mounts can.

Appearing as a green, winged elf of supernatural goodness and beauty, the
creature raises a massive silver trumpet and sounds a blast of piercing,
soul-wrenching music.
Trumpet archons serve as celestial messengers and heralds,
though their martial skills are considerable. Each carries a gleaming silver trumpet about 6 feet long.
Combat
A trumpet archon usually disdains physical combat, preferring
to obliterate foes with spells quickly and return to its duties. If
forced into an extended battle, it sounds its trumpet and attacks
with a vengeance.
A trumpet archon’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as good-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—detect evil, continual flame, message. Caster level 12th.
Aura of Menace (Su): Will DC 21 negates.

Spells: Trumpet archons can cast divine spells as 14th-level
clerics. A trumpet archon has access to two of the following
domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others
from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.
Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; DC 13 + spell
level): 0—detect magic, light, purify food and drink, read magic, resistance (2); 1st—bless (2), divine favor (2), protection from chaos*, sanctuary, shield of faith; 2nd—aid*, bull’s strength (2), consecrate, lesser
restoration, owl’s wisdom (2); 3rd—daylight, invisibility purge, magic
circle against chaos*, magic vestment, protection from energy (2); 4th—
dismissal, divine power, holy smite*, neutralize poison, spell immunity;
5th—dispel evil*, mass cure light wounds, plane shift, raise dead; 6th—
blade barrier*, banishment, heal, undeath to death; 7th—dictum*, holy
word, mass cure serious wounds.
*Domain spell. Domains: Good and Law.
Trumpet (Su): An archon’s trumpet produces music of utter
clarity, piercing beauty, and, if the trumpet archon wills it, paralyzing awe. All creatures except archons within 100 feet of the
blast must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for
1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. The archon can also
command its trumpet to become a +4 greatsword as a free action.
If a trumpet is ever stolen, it becomes a chunk of useless
metal until the owner can recover it. Woe betide any thief caught
with one.
ARROWHAWK
The creature has a sinuous, snakelike body with a long neck and tail. Two pairs
of feathered wings extend from the body, one on the top and another on the
bottom. Most of the body is covered with iridescent blue scales, with tufts of
yellow feathers at the base of the neck and the tail. The head has a black,
toothed beak and four eyes, one pair above the beak and the other below.
An arrowhawk is a predator and scavenger from the Elemental
Plane of Air. It is a consummate flier that spends its entire life on
the wing.
An arrowhawk is always in motion while it lives. It can fly from
the moment it hatches, and it eats, sleeps, and mates without ever
touching ground. By twisting its body and varying the cadence of
its wingbeats, an arrowhawk can fly at top speed in any direction.
Arrowhawk eggs have an innate levitation ability. Females lay
clutches of 2d4 eggs in midair and leave them to float until they
hatch. The female guards the eggs and collects them if the wind
scatters them, but otherwise leaves them alone.
A juvenile arrowhawk (1 to 10 years old) is about 5 feet long
from beak to tail, with the body accounting for about one-third
of that length. Its wingspan is about 7 feet, and it weighs about
20 pounds.
An adult (11 to 40 years old) is about 10 feet long from beak
to tail, with a wingspan of about 15 feet and a weight of about
100 pounds.

An elder arrowhawk (41
to 75 years old) is about 20
feet long with a wingspan
of 30 feet and a weight
of about 800 pounds.
Arrowhawks speak
Auran, but they are
not usually talkative
creatures.
COMBAT
Arrowhawks are extremely
territorial and always hungry.
They attack almost any other creature they meet, seeking a meal or
trying to drive away a rival. The primary mode of attack is an electricity
ray, fired from the tail. The creature
also bites, but it prefers to stay out
of reach.
Electricity Ray (Su): An
arrowhawk can fire this
ray once per round,
with a range of
50 feet.

This vine has a fibrous stem covered with
brown, stringy bark and as thick as a human’s
forearm. Its leaves are shaped like human hands.
The assassin vine is a semimobile plant that collects its own
grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing
the carcasses near its roots.
A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long.
Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine
about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of
leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of
small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The
fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter
flavor. Assassin vine berries make a
heady wine.
An assassin vine can move about, albeit
very slowly, but usually stays put unless it
needs to seek prey in a new vicinity.
A subterranean version of the
assassin vine grows near hot springs,
volcanic vents, and other sources
of thermal energy. These
plants have
thin, wiry stems
and gray leaves shot
through with silver, brown, and
white veins so that they resemble
mineral deposits. An assassin vine
growing underground usually
generates enough offal to
support a thriving colony of
mushrooms and other fungi,
which spring up around the plant
and help conceal it.
COMBAT
An assassin vine uses simple tactics: It lies still until prey comes within reach, then attacks. It uses
its entangle ability both to catch prey and to deter counterattacks.
Constrict (Ex): An assassin vine deals 1d6+7 points of damage
with a successful grapple check.
Entangle (Su): An assassin vine
can animate plants within 30 feet of
itself as a free action (Ref DC 13 partial). The effect lasts until the vine
dies or decides to end it (also a
free action). The save DC is
Wisdom-based. The ability is
otherwise similar to entangle
(caster level 4th).
Improved Grab (Ex): To
use this ability, an assassin
vine must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start
a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold
and can constrict.
Blindsight (Ex): Assassin
vines have no visual organs
but can ascertain all foes within
30 feet using sound, scent, and
vibration.
Camouflage (Ex): Since an assassin vine looks like a normal plant
when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Spot
check to notice it before it attacks.
Anyone with ranks in Survival or
Knowledge (nature) can use one of
those skills instead of Spot to notice
the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to
notice the subterranean version.

The creature looks like a portly giant
dressed in shabby rags and furs. It has
a third arm growing from its chest. Its
wide, slobbering mouth has curving
tusks that jut from its lower jaw.
It has tiny eyes, a small nose,
and lopsided ears—one huge
and one tiny.
The athach is a hulking, misshapen biped. Immensely strong, an
athach can hammer most opponents
to gory paste.
An athach rarely bathes,
and smells particularly
foul. An adult stands
some 18 feet tall and
weighs about 4,500
pounds.
Athachs are fond of gems
and crystals of all types. They often jam bracelets on their chubby
fingers, necklaces around their fat wrists, and wear other jewelry
where they can. They have been known to sit for hours, polishing
and admiring their jewels. The only other things athachs tend to
be passionate about are food and violence. They despise hill giants
and, unless outnumbered, attack them on sight. They fear other
giants and most other Huge creatures.
Athachs speak a crude dialect of Giant.
COMBAT
Athachs charge into melee combat unless their opponents are
out of reach, in which case they throw rocks. They sometimes try
to overrun armored opponents to reach unarmored opponents in
back ranks. With its first few melee attacks, an athach tends to
flail about indiscriminately. After a few rounds, it concentrates
on foes that have been hitting it most often and uses its bite on
whoever has dealt it the most damage.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The creature resembles a dwarf with hair of
fire and a beard of flames. It has
brass-colored skin and appears
to have been forged from
fire and metal.
Azers are dwarflike
beings native to the Elemental
Plane of Fire. They wear kilts of brass, bronze, or copper, and speak
Ignan and Common.
COMBAT
Azers use broad-headed spears or well-crafted hammers in
combat. When unarmed, they attempt to grapple foes.
Although unfriendly and taciturn, azers rarely provoke a
fight except to relieve a foe of gems, which they love. If threatened, they fight to the death, but they see the value of taking
prisoners themselves.
Heat (Ex): An azer’s body is intensely hot, so its unarmed
attacks deal extra fire damage. Its metallic weapons also conduct
this heat.

AZER SOCIETY
Azers maintain a tightly regimented society in which every
member has a specific place. The state always takes precedence
over the individual. Azer nobles are prodigiously
strong and wield absolute power. Azers dwell within
bronze fortresses on their home plane, only rarely
visiting other planes to gather gems. They hate
efreet, with whom they wage an eternal war for
territory and slaves.
AZERS AS CHARACTERS
Rare among their well-ordered kind, a few
azers leave behind the absolute rule of their

BARGHEST
A horrifying wolflike monster with blue-tinged fur, long sharp claws,
and a fiendish glint of intelligence in its hateful, glowing eyes darts out
of the shadows.
A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a
goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblin–wolf hybrid
with terrible jaws and sharp claws. Barghests come into
the world to feed on blood and souls and thus
grow stronger.
As whelps, barghests are nearly
indistinguishable from wolves,
except for their size and
claws. As they grow larger
and stronger,
their skin darkens to bluishred and eventually
becomes blue altogether. A fullgrown barghest,
such as the one described here, is about 6 feet long and weighs
180 pounds. A barghest’s eyes glow orange when the creature
becomes excited.
Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.
COMBAT
Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their
form, and usually disdain weapons. Though
they love killing, they have little stomach for
direct combat and attack from ambush
whenever possible. Barghests start a
combat by using crushing despair and
charm monster to keep opponents off balance. They try to stay away from the
enemy’s main strength.
A barghest’s natural weapons, as well
as any weapons it wields, are treated as
evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—blink,
levitate, misdirection (DC 14), rage (DC
15); 1/day—charm monster (DC 16),
crushing despair (DC 16), dimension door.
Caster level equals the barghest’s HD.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Feed (Su): When a barghest slays a
humanoid opponent, it can feed on the
corpse, devouring both flesh and life
force, as a full-round action. Feeding
destroys the victim’s body and prevents
any form of raising or resurrection
that requires part of the corpse.
There is a 50% chance that a wish,
miracle, or true resurrection spell can
restore a devoured victim to life. Check
once for each destroyed creature. If the check
fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by
mortal magic.
A barghest advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this
fashion. For every three suitable corpses a barghest devours, it
gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural
armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as
normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points,
feats, and ability score improvements normally.
The barghest only
advances by consuming the corpses of
creatures whose Hit
Dice or levels are
equal to or greater
than its own current
total. A barghest that
reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a
greater barghest upon completion
of the act.
Change Shape (Su): A barghest
can assume the shape of a goblin or
a wolf as a standard action. In
goblin form, a barghest
cannot use its natural weapons but can
wield weapons and
BARGHEST

wear armor. In wolf form, a barghest loses its claw attacks but
retains its bite attack.
Pass Without Trace (Ex): A barghest in wolf form can use pass
without trace (as the spell) as a free action.
Skills: *A barghest in wolf form gains a +4 circumstance bonus
on Hide checks.
GREATER BARGHEST
A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding becomes a
greater barghest. These creatures can change shape into a goblinlike creature of Large size (about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds)
or a dire wolf. In goblin form, a greater barghest cannot use its
natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In dire
wolf form, a greater barghest loses its claw attacks but retains
its bite attack.
A greater barghest can reach a maximum of 18 Hit Dice
through feeding.
Spell-Like Abilities: In addition to the spelllike abilities all barghests possess, a greater
barghest gains the following abilities. At
will—invisibility sphere; 1/day—mass bull’s
strength, mass enlarge. Caster level
equals the greater barghest’s HD.
Combat
Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a
magic two-handed weapon in combat
instead of its claws, giving it multiple attacks (attack bonus +13/+8). It
can also make one bite attack (attack bonus
+8) each round. The save DC against a greater
barghest’s spell-like abilities is 14 + spell level.
BASILISK
The creature looks like a thick-bodied reptile with eight legs. Rows of
bony spines jut from its back, and its eyes glow with an eerie, pale green
incandescence.
A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with
a mere gaze. Surviving a fight with a basilisk requires either careful preparation or considerable good fortune.
Basilisks are found in nearly every climate, and often in
underground areas as well. They tend to lair in shallow burrows,
caves, or other sheltered areas. The entrance to a basilisk lair is
sometimes distinguished by lifelike stone statues or carvings,
which are actually creatures that ran afoul of the creature’s gaze. Basilisks are omnivorous and able to
consume their petrified victims. They
make effective guardians, if one
has the magical or monetary

resources to capture and contain them.
A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a
short, curved horn
atop the nose. An adult
basilisk’s body grows to
about 6 feet long, not
including its tail, which
can reach an additional
length of 5 to 7 feet.
The creature weighs
about 300 pounds.
COMBAT
A basilisk relies on its
gaze attack, biting only
when opponents come
within reach. Though
it has eight legs, its
slow metabolism renders it relatively sluggish, so it does not
expend energy unnecessarily. Intruders who
flee a basilisk rather
than fight can expect,
at best, a halfhearted
pursuit.
These creatures tend
to spend most of their time
lying in wait for prey,
which includes small
mammals, birds, reptiles,
and similar creatures.
When not hunting, basilisks are usually sleeping off their latest
meal in their lairs. Basilisks sometimes gather in small colonies for
mating or for mutual defense in unusually hostile terrain, and a
colony will attack intruders in concert.
Petrifying Gaze (Su): Turn to stone permanently, range 30 feet;
Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Skills: *The basilisk’s dull coloration and its ability to remain
motionless for long periods
of time grant it a +4 racial
bonus on Hide checks in
natural settings.
ABYSSAL
GREATER
BASILISK
Adventurers are likely to
encounter these fiends of
the underworld either in
their native environment,
barren wastelands of the
Abyss, or summoned to the
employ of some dark sorcerer. Servants of the demon lords make good use
of the greater basilisk as
guards and escorts.
Combat
The save DC for the
abyssal greater basilisk’s
petrifying gaze (DC 21)
is adjusted for its greater
Hit Dice and higher
Charisma score.
An abyssal greater basilisk’s natural weapons are
treated as magic weapons
for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Smite Good (Su): Once per day an abyssal greater basilisk can
make a normal melee attack to deal an extra 18 points of damage
against a good foe.

At first the creature appears as a huge armored snake, slithering across the
ground at great speed. Then, without slowing, it unfolds a dozen legs from
its serpentine body and runs forward to strike.
The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or
use its dozen legs to move with considerable speed.
A behir is about 40 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It
can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in
snake fashion if it desires. The coloration of behirs ranges from
ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is
pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look
dangerous but are actually used for preening the creature’s scales,
not for fighting.
Behirs are never friendly with dragonkind and won’t coexist
with any type of dragon. If a dragon enters a behir’s territory, the
behir does everything it can to drive the dragon out. If the behir
fails, it moves off to find a new home. A behir never knowingly
enters the territory of a dragon.
Behirs speak Common.
COMBAT
A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows
or constricts the opponent. It can employ its claws only against
foes caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, it uses its
breath weapon.
Breath Weapon (Su): 20-foot line, once every 10 rounds,
damage 7d6 electricity, Reflex DC 19 half. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Constrict (Ex): A behir deals 2d8+8 points of damage with
a successful grapple check. It can make six rake attacks against
a grappled foe as well.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a behir must hit a creature of any size with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it it establishes a hold and can
attempt to constrict the opponent or swallow the opponent in the
following round.
Rake (Ex): Six claws, attack bonus +15 melee, damage 1d4+4.
Swallow Whole (Ex): A behir can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check.
A behir that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat to bite
and grab another opponent.
A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning
damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the behir’s
gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a
light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to
the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action
closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own
way out.
A behir’s gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128
Diminutive or smaller opponents.
Skills: Behirs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or
threatened.
BEHOLDER
It floats before you, a bulbous body with a central, unblinking eye, and a
large maw filled with daggerlike teeth. Smaller eyes, attached to wriggling
stalks, sprout from the top of the orblike body.
Beholders are the stuff of nightmares. These creatures, also called
the “spheres of many eyes” or “eye tyrants,” are deadly adversaries.
Beholders speak their own language and Common.
COMBAT
The primary weapon of both the gauth and the beholder is a series
of deadly eye rays.
Eye Rays (Su): Each of a beholder’s small eyes can produce
a magical ray once per round as a free action. During a single
round, a creature can aim only two eye rays (gauth) or three eye
rays (beholder) at targets in any one 90-degree arc (up, forward,
backward, left, right, or down). The remaining eyes must aim at
targets in other arcs, or not at all. A beholder can tilt and pan its
body each round to change which rays it can bring to bear in any
given arc.
Each eye’s effect resembles a spell (caster level 8th level for a
gauth, or 14th for a beholder), but follows the rules for a ray (see
Aiming a Spell, page 175 of the Player’s Handbook).
All-Around Vision (Ex): Beholders are exceptionally alert and
circumspect. Their many eyes give them a +4 racial bonus on Spot
and Search checks, and they can’t be flanked.
Flight (Ex): A beholder’s body is naturally buoyant. This
buoyancy allows it to fly at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy also
grants it a permanent feather fall effect (as the spell) with personal range.

The gauth, sometimes known as the lesser beholder, is a 4-foot
wide orb dominated by a central eye. Six smaller eyes on stalks
sprout from the top of its body. It is a rapacious and tyrannical
creature that seeks to exact tribute from anything weaker than
itself, and often attacks adventurers simply to acquire their wealth.
Eye Rays (Su): Each of a gauth’s six eye rays resembles a spell
cast by an 8th-level caster. Each eye ray has a range of 100 feet
and a save DC of 14. The save DCs are Charisma-based. The six
eye rays include:
Sleep: This works like the spell, except that it
affects one creature
with any number
of Hit Dice (Will
negates). Gauths
like to use this ray
against warriors and
other physically powerful creatures.
Inflict Moderate Wounds:
This works
like the spell,
causing 2d8+8
points of damage
(Will half ).
Dispel Magic: This works
like the targeted dispel function of the spell. The
gauth’s dispel check is
1d20+8.
Scorching Ray: This works like
the spell, dealing 4d6 points of
fire damage (no save). A gauth creates only one fiery ray per use of
this ability.
Paralysis: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d10 minutes.
Exhaustion: This works like the spell ray of
exhaustion (no save).
Stunning Gaze (Su): Stun for 1 round, 30 feet,
Will DC 14 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Any creature meeting the gaze of the gauth’s central eye
is subject to its stunning gaze attack. Since the gauth can use its
eye-rays as a free action, the creature can use a standard action to
focus its stunning gaze on an opponent and attack with all eye rays
that bear on its foes at the same time.

A beholder is
an 8-foot-wide orb
dominated by a central eye and a large, toothy
maw. Ten smaller eyes on
stalks sprout from the top of
the orb.
Combat
Beholders often attack without provocation. Though
not powerful physically, they
often plow right into groups
of opponents to use as many
of their eyes as they
can. When closing with
an enemy, a beholder
tries to cause as much
disruption and confusion
as possible.
Eye Rays (Su): Each
of a beholder’s ten eye
rays resembles a spell cast by a 13thlevel caster. Each eye ray has a
range of 150 feet and a save DC of
17. The save DCs are Charismabased. The ten eye rays include:
Charm Monster: The target must succeed on a
Will save or be affected as though by the spell.
Beholders use this ray to confuse the opposition,
usually employing it early in a fight. The beholder generally instructs a charmed target to either restrain a comrade or stand aside.
BEHOLDER
Beholder
26
Charm Person: The target must succeed on a Will save or be
affected as though by the spell. Beholders use this ray in the same
manner as the charm monster ray.
Disintegrate: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or be
affected as though by the spell. The beholder likes to use this ray
on any foe it considers a real threat.
Fear: This works like the spell, except that it targets one creature.
The target must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by
the spell. Beholders like to use this ray against warriors and other
powerful creatures early in a fight, to break up the opposition.
Finger of Death: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or be
slain as though by the spell. The target takes 3d6+13 points of damage if its saving throw succeeds. Beholders use this ray to eliminate dangerous foes quickly.
Flesh to Stone: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or be
affected as though by the spell. Beholders like to aim this ray at
enemy spellcasters. They also use it on any creature whose appearance they find interesting. (After the fight, the beholder takes the
statue to its lair as a decoration.)
Inflict Moderate Wounds: This works like the spell, causing
2d8+10 points of damage (Will half ).
Sleep: This works like the spell, except that it affects one creature
with any number of Hit Dice (Will negates). Beholders like to use
this ray against warriors and other physically powerful creatures.
They know their foes can quickly awaken the sleepers, but they
also know that doing so takes time and can delay an effective
counterattack.
Slow: This works like the spell, except that it affects one creature. The target can make a Will save to negate the effect. Beholders often use this ray against the same creature targeted by their
disintegrate, flesh to stone, or finger of death ray. If one
of the former rays fails to eliminate the foe, this
ray might at least hamper it.
Telekinesis: A beholder can move objects
or creatures that weigh up to 325 pounds,
as though with a telekinesis spell. Creatures can resist the effect with a successful Will save.
Antimagic Cone (Su): A beholder’s
central eye continually produces a 150-
foot cone of antimagic. This functions
just like antimagic field (caster level
13th). All magical and supernatural
powers and effects within the cone are
suppressed—even the beholder’s own
eye rays. Once each round, during its
turn, the beholder decides whether the
antimagic cone is active or not (the
beholder deactivates the cone by shutting its
central eye).
Beholder Society
Beholders are hateful, aggressive, and avaricious, attacking or dominating others whenever they can get away with it. They exhibit
a xenophobic intolerance, hating all creatures
not like themselves. The basic body type comprises a great variety
of beholder subspecies. Some are covered with overlapping chitinous plates; some have smooth hides or snakelike eye tentacles;
some have crustacean joints. But even a difference as small as hide
color or size of the central eye can make two groups of beholders
sworn enemies. Every beholder declares its own unique form to
be the “true ideal of beholderhood,” the others being nothing but
ugly replicas fit only to be eliminated.
Beholders usually carve out underground lairs for themselves
using their disintegrate rays. Beholder architecture emphasizes the
vertical, and a lair usually has a number of parallel tubes, with
chambers stacked on top of each other. Beholders prefer inaccessible locations that earthbound foes can reach only with difficulty.

A mass of dark smoke moves against the breeze, shifting shape as
it comes closer. Cloudlike, roiling, it suddenly explodes into a
demonic creature of smoke and wind, with large bat wings,
clawed tendrils, and a biting maw.
Belkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They
are composed primarily of smoke. Although
undeniably evil, they are very reclusive and
usually have no interest in the affairs of others.
A belker’s winged shape makes it look distinctly demonic. Because of its semigaseous
nature, however, it shifts and changes shape
with every puff of wind. It is about 7 feet long
and weighs about 8 pounds.
Belkers speak Auran.
COMBAT
In most cases, a belker fights with its nasty claws
and painful bite.
Smoke Claws (Ex): A belker in smoke form (see
below) can engulf opponents by moving on top of them. It fills
the air around one Medium or smaller opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. The target must
succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or inhale part of
the creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Smoke inside the victim solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at
the surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round.
An affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous menace.
Smoke Form (Su): Most of the time a belker is more or less
solid, but at will it can assume smoke form. It can switch forms
once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per
day in smoke form. A belker in smoke form can fly at a speed of 50
feet (perfect). The ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell
(caster level 7th).
Skills: Belkers have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

A big canine with yellow-brown fur and large ears appears completely ordinary. And then it disappears in the blink of an eye and instantly reappears
in a different location.
The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited teleportation ability.
Blink dogs are social animals, often traveling in packs. They
eat equal amounts of meat and plant matter. They avoid human
lands but drive off evil humanoids that enter their territory.
Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps,
whines, and growls that can transmit complex information.
When not hunting, they are playful with each other but very
protective of their pups, which outsiders sometimes steal to
train as guard animals. Blink dogs and displacer beasts are natural enemies.
COMBAT
Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random fashion until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to take
advantage of flanking.
Blink (Su): A blink dog can use blink as the spell (caster level
8th), and can evoke or end the effect as a free action.
Dimension Door (Su): A blink dog can teleport, as dimension
door (caster level 8th), once per round as a free action. The ability
affects only the blink dog, which never appears within a solid
object and can act immediately after teleporting.

This muscular, savage humanoid stands 7 feet tall. Coarse hair covers
most of its body. Its mouth is full of long, sharp fangs, and its nose is much
like that of a bear.
The biggest and strongest of the goblinoids, bugbears are more aggressive than their smaller relatives. They live by hunting any
creature weaker than themselves.
The bugbear’s nose is the cause of its name, though the creature
is not related to bears. Its hide and sharp claws also resemble
those of bears. A bugbear’s hands are far more dexterous than a
bear’s paws, however, and its claws are too small to make effective weapons.
Bugbears speak Goblin and Common.
COMBAT
Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents whenever possible. When
hunting, they normally send scouts ahead of the main group that,
if they spy prey, return to report and bring up reinforcements.
Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if
not brilliant.
Skills: Bugbears have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently
checks.
BUGBEAR SOCIETY
Bugbears prefer to dwell in temperate, mountainous regions with
many caves, living in small tribal units. A single bugbear, usually
the biggest and meanest, leads each tribe. A tribe has as many
young as it has adults. Children do not join the adults in the hunt,
but they will fight to protect themselves or their lairs.
Bugbears have only two genuine goals in life: food and treasure. Prey and intruders are considered a valuable source of
both. These extremely greedy creatures prize anything shiny,
including arms and armor. They never miss an opportunity to
increase their hoards through theft, plunder, and ambush. On
rare occasions they parley with other beings if they believe
something can be gained, but they are not skilled negotiators,
losing their patience quickly if such encounters run overlong.
They are sometimes found commanding goblins and hobgoblins,
whom they bully mercilessly.
Bugbears survive primarily by hunting, and they eat whatever
they can bring down. Any creature is a legitimate source of food,
including monsters and even their own smaller kin. When game
is scarce, bugbears turn to raiding and ambush to fill their stewpots.
Most bugbears revere a deity named Hruggek, who delights in
ambushes followed by furious combat.
BUGBEARS AS CHARACTERS

The ground shakes and rolls and then bursts open to reveal a terrible,
armor-plated, bullet-shaped creature with a huge snapping maw and
short, powerful legs.
Also known as the landshark, the bulette is a terrifying predator
that lives only to eat. It is universally shunned, even by other
monsters. Fortunately for the rest of the world, the bulette is a solitary animal, although mated pairs (very rare) might share the same
territory. Since its appetite is so voracious, each bulette has a large
territory that can range up to 30 square miles. Other predators
rarely share territory with one, for fear of being eaten. A bulette
has no lair, preferring to wander above and below ground; it burrows beneath the soil to rest.
A bulette totally consumes its victims—clothing, weapons, and
all. Its powerful stomach acid quickly destroys armor, weapons,
and even magic items. It is not above nibbling on chests or sacks
of coins either. When it has eaten everything in its territory, a
bulette moves on. The sole criterion for a suitable territory is availability of food, so bulettes occasionally locate themselves near
human settlements and terrorize the residents.
COMBAT
A bulette attacks anything it regards as edible, choosing the easiest
or closest prey first. The only creatures it refuses to eat are elves
(and it dislikes the taste of dwarves). When burrowing underground, a landshark relies on its tremorsense ability to detect prey.
When it senses something edible (that is, senses movement), it
breaks to the surface, crest first, and begins its attack.
The bulette has a foul temperament—stupid, mean, and
fearless. The size, strength, and number of its opponents mean
nothing.
Leap (Ex): A bulette can jump into the air during combat. This
allows it to make four claw attacks instead of two, each with a +15
attack bonus, but it cannot bite.

The stink of rotten meat surrounds this multilegged creature with a
segmented, 10-foot-long body. Eight writhing tentacles protrude from
its head, growing directly from below its clacking mandibles and toothfilled maw.
Carrion crawlers are aggressive subterranean scavengers, greatly
feared for their paralyzing attacks. They scour their underground
territory for dead and decaying flesh but won’t hesitate to attack
and kill living creatures.
Each of a carrion crawler’s tentacles is about 2 feet long and
secretes a sticky, paralyzing substance. Like so many hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of arcane experimentation. A carrion crawler weighs about 500 pounds.
COMBAT
Carrion crawlers use their senses of sight and smell to detect carcasses and potential prey. When attacking, a crawler lashes out

with its tentacles and tries to paralyze its victim. The tentacles
deal no other damage. The creature then kills the paralyzed
victim with its bite and devours the flesh. Multiple crawlers do
not fight in concert, but each paralyzes as many opponents as possible. The unintelligent creature continues to attack as long as it
faces any moving opponents.
Paralysis (Ex): Those hit by a
carrion crawler’s tentacle attack
must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4
rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

CELESTIAL CREATURE
Celestial creatures dwell on the upper planes, the realms of good,
although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They
are more regal and more beautiful than their earthly counterparts.
Celestial creatures often come in metallic colors (usually silver,
gold, or platinum). They can be mistaken for half-celestials, more
powerful creatures that are created when a celestial mates with a
noncelestial creature.

CREATING A CELESTIAL CREATURE
“Celestial” is an inherited template that can be added to any
corporeal animal, aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, plant, or vermin of
good or neutral alignment (referred to hereafter as the base
creature).
A celestial creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and
abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature’s
Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type
changes.
Size and Type: Animals or vermin with this template become
magical beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size
is unchanged. Celestial creatures encountered on the Material
Plane have the extraplanar subtype.
Special Attacks: A celestial creature retains all the special
attacks of the base creature and also gains the following attack.
Smite Evil (Su): Once per day a celestial creature can make a
normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against an evil foe.
Special Qualities: A celestial creature retains all the special
qualities of the base creature and also gains the following qualities.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Damage reduction (see the table below).
—Resistance to acid, cold, and electricity (see the table below).
—Spell resistance equal to HD + 5 (maximum 25).

The creature gallops out of the
trees, its thundering hooves echoing
throughout the forest. It has the upper
torso, arms, and head of a humanoid, and the lower body of a large
horse. It carries a longbow, drawn
and nocked, ready to loose an arrow
at the first hint of danger.
Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of strangers.
They are deadly archers and even more fearsome in melee.
A centaur is as big as a heavy horse, but much taller and
slightly heavier. A centaur is about 7 feet tall and weighs about
2,100 pounds.
Centaurs speak Sylvan and Elven.
COMBAT
Although generally mild-tempered, centaurs are always armed.
Their favorite melee weapon is the longsword. When scouting or
hunting, they carry composite longbows. A centaur employing a
lance deals double damage when it charges, just as a rider on a
mount does.
Centaurs usually don’t provoke a fight. Their normal response
to aggression is swift retreat, perhaps after launching a few
arrows to discourage pursuit. Against creatures powerful enough
to pose danger to the tribe, they appear to use this same tactic,
except that about half of the “retreating” centaurs will circle
around to lie in ambush or attack the foe from the rear.
CENTAUR SOCIETY
Among their own kind, centaurs are sociable creatures, but they
have been known to become rowdy, boorish, and aggressive when
under the influence of alcohol.
Solitary centaurs are usually out hunting or scouting. Companies and troops are usually hunting or scouting in force. Most of
the members of a centaur tribe remain near their lair. Most of the
centaurs in the tribal lair are female; while the males are out hunting and scouting, the females lead and administer the tribe. A
third of a tribe’s population is young.
The typical centaur lair is located deep within a forest. It consists of a large hidden glade and pastures, with a good supply of
running water. Depending on the climate, the lair may contain
huts or lean-tos to shelter individual families. Hearths for cooking and warmth
are in an open area, away from the
trees.
Centaurs are skilled in horticulture and may cultivate useful plants
near their lair. In dangerous, monster-infested areas they plant thick
barriers of thorn bushes around
their lair, dig pits, and set snares.
Centaurs survive through a mixture of hunting, foraging, fishing,
agriculture, and trade. Though they
shun dealings with humans, centaurs do trade with elves, especially for food and wine. The elves
are paid from the tribe’s treasury,
which consists of the booty of
slain monsters.
The size of a centaur tribe’s territory varies with its population and
the nature of the area it inhabits.
Centaurs do not object to sharing
territory with elves. The attitude of a
centaur toward a stranger in its territory depends on the visitor. Humans
and dwarves are politely asked to
leave, halflings or gnomes are tolerated, and elves are welcomed.
Centaurs deal with monsters
according to how much of a threat
they are to the welfare and survival of the tribe: If a giant or
dragon were to enter a tribe’s territory, the centaurs would relocate, but they would attempt to kill
trolls, orcs, and the like.
Most centaurs revere a deity named Skerrit, who is a god of
nature and community.
CENTAURS AS CHARACTERS
Centaurs sometimes become bards, rangers, or druids. Centaur
rangers often choose magical beasts or some variety of humanoid
as their favored enemy. A centaur druid is usually a tribe’s designated leader and speaker. Centaur clerics (who are rare) worship
Skerrit and can choose any two of the following domains: Animal,
Good, or Plant.
Centaur characters possess the following racial traits.
— +8 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, –2 Intelligence,
+2 Wisdom.
—Large size. –1 penalty to Armor Class, –1 penalty on attack

Foul and terrible, the creature
before you has no set form. It constantly melts and reforms, apparently drawing each shape from
every nightmare that has ever
plagued humankind. It chaotically shifts through a dozen
monstrous forms before shaping itself into a bulbous thing
with ten eyes swimming in a
viscous sac at the top of a body
that’s surrounded by a ring
of smacking mouths.
The horrific creatures known as
chaos beasts have mutable, ever-changing forms. Their deadly touch can
make opponents melt into formless
goo.
There’s no telling what a chaos beast will look like. One
moment it might be a towering horror of hooks and fangs, all
pulpy flesh and exposed veins, and the next a slithering mass of
ropy, vermilion-tipped tentacles. Then it become a mighty creature, all muscle and fury A chaos beast’s dimensions vary, but it
always weighs about 200 pounds.
Chaos beasts do not speak.
COMBAT
How many different attacks can a creature capable of any form
have? In this case, only two.
For all its fearsome appearances, whether it has claws, fangs,
pincers, tentacles, or spines, a chaos beast does little physical
harm. Regardless of form, the creature seems unable to manage
more than two attacks per round. Its continual transmutations
prevent the coordination needed to do more.
A chaos beast’s claw attacks, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Corporeal Instability (Su): A blow from a chaos beast against
a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature
must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become a spongy,
amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect
(see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing,
armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or
carried—armor, backpacks, even shirts—hamper more than help,
reducing the victim’s Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet
and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever
is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the
victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use
magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend
from foe (–4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).
Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1
point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim’s
Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast.
A victim can regain its own shape by taking
a standard action to attempt a DC 15
Charisma check (this check DC
does not vary for a chaos beast
with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature’s normal
form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still
repeat this check each
round until successful.
Corporeal instability is
not a disease or a curse
and so is hard to remove.
A shapechange or stoneskin
spell does not cure an
afflicted creature but fixes
its form for the duration
of the spell. A restoration, heal, or greater
restoration spell removes the affliction (a separate restoration is necessary to
restore any drained points of
Wisdom).
Immunity to Transformation (Ex): No mortal
magic can permanently
affect or fix a chaos beast’s
form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into a new shape, but at
the start of its next turn it immediately returns to its mutable form
as a free action.

This creature has the hindquarters of a big goat and the forequarters of a
great lion. It has dragon wings and three heads: a horned goat, a maneless lion, and a fierce dragon.
The chimera is a bizarre predator that hunts on the ground and
on the wing. It can defeat even the hardiest opponent with a
flurry of claws and fangs.
A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet
long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera’s dragon head
might be black, blue, green, red, or white.
Chimeras can speak Draconic but seldom bother to do so,
except when toadying to more powerful creatures.
COMBAT
A deadly foe, the chimera prefers to surprise prey. It often
swoops down from the sky or lies concealed until it charges. The
dragon head can loose a breath weapon instead of biting. Several
chimeras attack in concert.
Breath Weapon (Su): A chimera’s breath weapon depends
on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the
table below.
Regardless of its type, a chimera’s breath weapon is usable once
every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 17
Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
To determine a chimera’s head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.
1d10 Head Color Breath Weapon
1–2 Black 40-foot line of acid
3–4 Blue 40-foot line of lightning
5–6 Green 20-foot cone of gas (acid)

Skills: A chimera’s three heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Spot

*In areas of scrubland or brush, a chimera gains a +4 racial

A creature perches in the shadows, near the ceiling, in a corner of the
chamber. Its body resembles that of a naked halfling with mottled flesh,
but its limbs are incredibly spindly and long. It hisses, showing sharp, large
teeth an instant before one of its limbs snaps out like a whip.
These vicious little predators lurk underground, grabbing whatever prey happens by.
A choker’s skull, spine, and rib cage are bony, but its limbs are
really tentacles with multiple knobby joints of cartilage. Thus, it
appears bowlegged, and its movements seem peculiar and fluid.
Its hands and feet have spiny pads that help the choker grip
almost any surface. The creature weighs about 35 pounds.
Chokers speak Undercommon.
COMBAT
A choker likes to perch near the ceiling, often at
intersections, archways, wells, or staircases, and reach
down to attack its prey.
A choker attacks creatures of almost any size, but
prefers lone prey of its size or larger. If one is very
hungry, it may attack a group, but it waits to grab
the last creature in line.

Chokers are greedy. Quick-thinking characters who spot
one before it attacks might be able to bribe a choker
with food and question it about the
area around its lair.
Constrict (Ex): A choker deals
1d3+3 points of damage with a successful grapple check against a
Large or smaller creature. Because
it seizes its victim by the neck, a
creature in the choker’s grasp
cannot speak or cast spells with
verbal components.
Improved Grab (Ex): To
use this ability, a choker must
hit a Large or smaller opponent
with a tentacle attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. If it wins
the grapple check, it establishes
a hold and can constrict. Chokers receive a +4 racial bonus on
grapple checks, which is already
included in the statistics block.
Quickness (Su): Although not
particularly dexterous, a choker is
supernaturally quick. It can take an
extra standard action or move action
during its turn each round.
Skills: A chokers has a +8 racial bonus on

Like some large insect or monstrous
crustacean, the creature rises from
the still pool, its pincerlike claws
snapping angrily as torchlight
reflects off its mottled, armored carapace. Its small dark eyes fix you with
a hungry stare, and the tentacles
dripping from its mouth squirm excitedly as it emerges from the water.
A horrible mix of crustacean,
insect, and serpent, the chuul is an
abomination that lurks submerged
or partially submerged, awaiting
intelligent prey to devour.
Although amphibious, chuuls
are not good swimmers and actually prefer to be on land or in very
shallow water when they attack.
They love to prey on lizardfolk.
Chuuls are known to collect trophies from their kills. Although
unable to use weapons, armor, or
most other belongings, chuuls keep
these items in their lairs. If a victim
has no interesting possessions, the
chuul takes its skull.
Most chuuls live in swamps and jungles,
but some have adapted to subterranean
life, hunting in and near underground
streams and lakes. These underground varieties often prey on
troglodytes and unwary drow.
They are sometimes found as
thralls of beholders or mind flayers.
A chuul is about 8 feet long and weighs 650 pounds.
Chuuls speak Common (or Undercommon, for the underground variety).
COMBAT
A chuul prefers to wait by the shore, submerged in murky water,
until it hears nearby prey (in or out of the water) that it can attack
with surprise.
A chuul grabs with its claws and constricts its foe, then passes
the opponent to its paralytic tentacles. It tries to
always have one claw free, so if it faces a large
number of opponents, it drops a paralyzed or
dead victim and continues attempting to
grab, constrict, and paralyze the rest.
Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple
check, a chuul deals 3d6+5 points of
damage.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this
ability, a chuul must hit with a
claw attack. It can then attempt
to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can constrict or
on its next turn transfer a
grabbed opponent to its
tentacles.
Paralytic Tentacles (Ex):
A chuul can transfer grabbed
victims from a claw to its tenCHUUL
Choker

tacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with the same
strength as the claw but deal no damage. However, they exude a
paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a
DC 19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul’s turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held
in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes
1d8+2 points of damage each round from the creature’s mandibles.
Amphibious (Ex): Although chuuls are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.
Skills: A chuul has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A long black cloak hangs from the cave wall. Suddenly, the cloak slips
from the wall and catches a breeze moving through the cavern. Then
it unfolds, the cloak becoming dark wings and a bony, whiplike tail unfurling to stretch out behind it. It flies forward, revealing a toothy maw and
piercing red eyes deep in the shadows of its raylike body.
Cloakers are bizarre creatures that lurk in dark places far beneath
the surface. They kill intruders without remorse or pause, except
to plan cruel amusement.
When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to distinguish from common black cloaks (the cloaker’s ivory
claws look very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does
the horrific nature of the creature become apparent.
Cloakers pursue their own mysterious goals. While they are certainly intelligent, their minds work in a way so alien that few
humans have ever been able to make meaningful contact with one.
A cloaker has a wingspan of about 8 feet. It weighs about 100
pounds.
Cloakers speak Undercommon.
COMBAT
Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey. If
facing a single opponent, a cloaker uses its engulf attack.
Against multiple foes, it lashes with its tail in concert with its
moan and shadow shift abilities to reduce the opposition’s numbers, then engulfs a survivor. Multiple cloakers usually split up,
leaving one or two behind to use special abilities while the rest
make melee attacks.
Moan (Ex): A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan as a
standard action. By changing the frequency, the cloaker can cause
one of four effects. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mindaffecting attacks. Unless otherwise specified, a creature that successfully saves against one of these effects cannot be affected by
the same moan effect from the same cloaker for 24 hours. All save
DCs for moan effects are Charisma-based.
Unnerve: Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes
a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear the
moan for more than 6 consecutive rounds must succeed on a
DC 15 Will save or enter a trance, unable to attack or defend
themselves until the moaning stops.
Fear: Anyone within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15
Will save or become panicked for 2 rounds.
Nausea: Anyone in a 30-foot
cone must succeed on a DC 15
Fortitude save or be overcome by nausea and weakness. Affected characters
fall prone and become
nauseated for 1d4+1
rounds.
Stupor: A single creature within 30 feet of the
cloaker must succeed on
a DC 15 Fortitude save
or be affected as though
by a hold monster spell
for 5 rounds. Even after a
successful save, the creature must repeat the save if
the cloaker uses this effect
again.
Engulf (Ex): A cloaker can
try to wrap a Medium or smaller
creature in its body as a standard
action. The cloaker attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and bites the
engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its
attack roll. It can still use its whiplike
tail to strike at other targets.
Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker
deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped
victim.
Shadow Shift (Su): A cloaker can manipulate shadows. This
ability is effective only in shadowy areas and has three possible
effects.
Obscure Vision: The cloaker gains concealment (20% miss
chance) for 1d4 rounds.
Dancing Images: This effect duplicates a mirror image spell (caster
level 6th).
Silent Image: This effect duplicates a silent image spell (DC 15,
caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

This avian creature is about the size of a large goose or turkey. It has the
head and body of a cockerel, bat wings, and the long tail of a lizard. Its
eyes glow with a dangerous-looking crimson sheen.
The cockatrice is an eerie, repulsive hybrid. It is infamous for its
ability to turn flesh to stone.
A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster.
Females, much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no
wattles or comb. A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds.
COMBAT
A cockatrice fiercely attacks anything that it deems a threat to
itself or its lair. Flocks of cockatrices do their utmost to overwhelm and confuse their foes, and sometimes fly directly into
their opponents’ faces.
Petrification (Su): Creatures hit by a cockatrice’s bite attack
must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or instantly turn to
stone. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Cockatrices have
immunity to the petrification ability of other
cockatrices, but other
petrification attacks
affect them normally
(a medusa’s gaze, gorgon’s
breath, a flesh to stone spell, or
the like).

This great serpent with rainbow-feathered wings appears confident, powerful, and totally aware of everything around it.
The couatl is legendary for its sheer beauty, vast magical powers,
and unwavering virtue. Its intelligence and goodness have made it
an object of reverence in the regions it inhabits.
A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of about 15 feet.
It weighs about 1,800 pounds.
Couatls speak Celestial, Common, and Draconic, and
also have the power of telepathy (see below).
COMBAT
A couatl seldom attacks without provocation,
though it always attacks evildoers caught redhanded. It uses its detect thoughts ability on any creature that arouses its suspicions. Since it is highly intelligent, a couatl usually casts spells from a distance before
closing. If more than one couatl is involved, they discuss
their strategy before a battle.
Constrict (Ex): A couatl deals 2d8+6 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a couatl must
hit a creature of up to two size categories larger with its
bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold
and can constrict.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 16,
initial damage 2d4 Str, secondary damage 4d4 Str.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Psionics (Sp): At will—detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect
law, detect thoughts (DC 15), invisibility, plane shift (DC 20), polymorph (self only). Effective caster level 9th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.
COUATL
Cockatrice 37
Spells: A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer. It can choose its spells known from the
sorcerer list, the cleric list, and from the lists
for the Air, Good, and Law domains. The
cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning that the creature does not need a
divine focus to cast them.
Typical Spells Known (6/7/7/7/4;
save DC 13 + spell level): 0—cure
minor wounds, daze, disrupt undead,
light, obscuring mist, ray of frost, read
magic, resistance; 1st—endure elements,
mage armor, protection from chaos, true
strike, wind wall; 2nd—cure moderate
wounds, eagle’s splendor, scorching ray,
silence; 3rd—gaseous form, magic circle
against evil, summon monster III; 4th—
charm monster, freedom of movement.
Ethereal Jaunt (Su): This ability works
like the ethereal jaunt spell (caster level
16th).
Telepathy (Su): A couatl can communicate
telepathically with any creature within 90 feet
that has an Intelligence score. The creature can
respond to the couatl if it wishes—no common
language is needed.

The stalactite above seems to break apart, revealing itself to be a creature that resembles a squid or
octopus, with a stonelike shell covering its body
and a tough membrane stretched between its
unfolding tentacles.
The darkmantle lurks near cavern roofs,
waiting for prey to pass beneath. Its
ability to create magical darkness makes
it difficult to defeat.
The darkmantle hangs from a ceiling
by a muscular “foot” at the top of its
body. It can look like a stalactite, by
holding its tentacles stiffly under itself,
or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so the membrane between them
covers its body. Its shell and skin usually
resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can
change its color to match almost any type of
stony background.
Scholars believe the darkmantle has recently evolved from a similar but far less capable
subterranean predator. A darkmantle is about 4
feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the top of
its head. It weighs about 30 pounds.
COMBAT
A darkmantle attacks by dropping onto its prey and
wrapping its tentacles around the opponent’s head. Once
attached, it squeezes and tries to suffocate the foe. A darkmantle
that misses its initial attack often flies up and tries to drop on the
opponent again.
Darkness (Su): Once per day a
darkmantle can cause darkness
as the darkness spell (caster level
5th). It most often uses this ability just before attacking.
Improved Grab (Ex): To
use this ability, a darkmantle
must hit a Large or smaller
creature with its slam attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it attaches to the
opponent’s head and
can constrict.
Constrict (Ex):
A darkmantle deals
1d4+4 points of damage with a successful
grapple check.
Blindsight (Ex): A darkmantle can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds,
inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain
objects and creatures within 90 feet. A
silence spell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.
Skills: A darkmantle has a +4 racial
bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The
creature’s variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide
checks.

A huge creature burrows through the solid rock wall. Its teardrop-shaped,
rocky body glistens with slime, and it uses the blunt claws of its two great
appendages to clear away the debris.
The delver is a bizarre creature that lives in the depths of the
earth, burrowing through solid stone with the help of a corrosive slime it secretes from its rocklike skin.
Delvers are shy and mostly
inoffensive, but rogue specimens with murderous streaks
are not unknown. They feed
on stone and may even devour
creatures such as xorns and
earth elementals. A delver burrowing through stone leaves
behind a usable tunnel about
10 feet in diameter.
The slime covering a delver’s
body is highly corrosive. The
creature feeds by dissolving
rock with its slime and shoving the resulting goo under its
body, the underside of which
is almost all mouth.
A delver eats rock but enjoys various nonmetallic minerals as seasonings in the
same way that a human enjoys
spices. Adventurers might
secure information and assistance from a delver by offering it tasty minerals (usually
gems) or pick-me-ups (such
as coins). Metal is an intoxicant to delvers. Some delvers
become addicted to metal and
are a menace to miners and anyone who carries metal equipment.
A delver is about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. It weighs about
6,000 pounds.
Delvers speak Terran and Undercommon.
COMBAT
A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, which it uses to protect
its flanks while lashing out with its flippers.
A delver expecting trouble may honeycomb an area with tunnels, leaving most closed with layers of stone 1 or 2 inches thick.
The delver can quickly dissolve the stone cover and pop up to
attack unexpectedly.
Corrosive Slime (Ex): A delver produces a mucuslike slime
that contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly effective against stone.
A delver’s mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to
organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or
objects, a delver’s slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against
stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals
8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch
of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another
2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar,
washes off the slime.
An opponent’s armor and clothing dissolve and become useless
immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save.
Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the
wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save.
A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes
damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the
creature succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. These save DCs are
Constitution-based.
Stone Shape (Ex): A delver can alter its slime to temporarily
soften stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a
delver can soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of stone, as a stone
shape spell (caster level 15th).

DEMON
Demons are a race of creatures native to the Abyss, a plane of endless evil. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature
just for the sheer fun of it—even other demons. They enjoy terrifying their victims before slaying them and often devour the slain.
Many demons, not satisfied with their own iniquity, take pleasure
in tempting mortals to become as depraved as they are.
A number of demons belong to a race (and subtype) known as
the tanar’ri. The tanar’ri form the largest and most diverse group of
demons, and they are the unchallenged masters of the Abyss.
Tanar’ri Traits: A tanar’ri possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Immunity to electricity and poison.
—Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10.
—Summon (Sp): Tanar’ri share the ability to summon others of
their kind (the success chance and type of tanar’ri summoned are
noted in each monster description). However, between their
arrogance and disdain for owing favors to one another, tanar’ri
are often reluctant to use this power until in obvious peril or
extreme circumstances.
—Telepathy.
Except where otherwise noted, demons speak Abyssal, Celestial,
and Draconic.

Reeking of decay, this gaunt humanoid is covered in black, leathery skin.
Behind its pointed ears, a large curved horn rises out of the back of its
skull. A mouth of jagged teeth takes up half of the foul creature’s head.
Babaus serve as assassins that strike with a sudden ferocity. They
are devious, forming careful plans before going into plans—
always making sure that they do not have to engage in a fair fight.
Almost every demon lord has a number of babaus employed as
spies and killers.
A babau is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 140 pounds.
Combat
Babaus are sneaky and sly. They attack the most powerful foe first,
hoping to eliminate the true threats quickly and then toy with the
rest. When ambushing their opponents, they make excellent use
of the combination of multiple attacks and sneak attacks.
A babau’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Sneak Attack (Ex): A babau can make a sneak attack like a
rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage whenever a foe is
denied his or her Dexterity bonus, or when the babau is flanking.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—darkness, dispel magic, see invisibility, greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level
7th.
Protective Slime (Su): A slimy red jelly coats the babau’s skin.
Any weapon that touches it takes 1d8 points of acid damage from
the corrosive goo, and the weapon’s hardness does not reduce this
damage. A magic weapon may attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to
avoid taking this damage. A creature who strikes the babau with
an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, touch spell, or natural weapon
takes this damage as well but can negate the damage with a DC 18
Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a babau can attempt to summon 1 babau with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the
equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
Skills: Babaus have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, and Search checks.

DEMON
40
A dark aura of power surrounds this towering humanoid with huge bat
wings. Lurid flames dance over its skin. In one of its massive clawed hands,
this creature bears a sword that looks sharp enough to cut even to the
soul. In its other hand, it bears a whip licked by tongues of fire.
Balors stand among the greatest and most terrible of the underworld creatures. They rule as generals over demonic armies. They
are the masterminds of schemes to seize power and destroy the
innocent. Even among their own kind, balors are feared, as they
motivate their kindred to spread terror and misery.
A balor stands about 12 feet tall. Its skin is usually dark red. It
weighs about 4,500 pounds.
Combat
Balors love to join battle armed with their swords and whips. If
they face stiff resistance, they may teleport away to loose a few
spell-like effects at the foe.
A balor’s +1 flaming whip is a long, flexible weapon with many
tails tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls. The weapon deals bludgeoning and slashing damage, in addition to fire damage.
A balor’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Death Throes (Ex): When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding
flash of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within
100 feet (Reflex DC 30 half ). This explosion automatically
destroys any weapons the balor is holding. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Entangle (Ex): A balor’s +1
flaming whip entangles foes
much like an attack with a
net. The whip has 20
hit points. The
whip needs no
folding. If it
hits, the target and the
balor immediately make
opposed Strength checks; if the
balor wins, it drags the target against
its flaming body (see below). The target
remains anchored against the balor’s
body until it escapes the whip.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—
blasphemy (DC 25), dominate
monster (DC 27), greater
dispel magic, greater teleport
(self plus 50 pounds of objects only), insanity
(DC 25), power word stun, telekinesis (DC 23), unholy
aura (DC 26); 1/day—fire storm (DC 26), implosion (DC 27).
Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Vorpal Sword (Su): Every balor carries a +1 vorpal longsword
that looks like a flame or a bolt of lightning.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a balor can automatically
summon 4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrous, or one nalfeshnee, glabrezu,
marilith, or balor. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.
Flaming Body (Su): The body of a balor is wreathed in flame.
Anyone grappling a balor takes 6d6 points of fire damage each
round.
True Seeing (Su): Balors have a continuous true seeing ability,
as the spell (caster level 20th).
Skills: Balors have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
Tactics Round-by-Round
The balor is most effective as a ranged combatant, using its spelllike abilities to attack from a distance.
Prior to combat: Unholy aura.
Round 1: Fire storm or implosion and quickened telekinesis, or
summon additional demons. If the balor does not deem itself seriously threatened, it conserves abilities usable only once per day
and uses blasphemy instead.
Round 2: Insanity or power word stun.

An enormous, misshapen spider stalks out of the darkness. Its forelegs end
in wicked barbs, and globs of foul goo drip from its fanged mouth.
Bebiliths are enormous, predatory, arachnid demons that hunt
other demons. While they favor preying upon other demons, they
aren’t picky—they will stalk and attack any type of creature.
A bebilith has a body the size of a plow horse, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs more than two tons.
Bebiliths understand but do not speak Abyssal. Their telepathy
allows them to communicate silently with one another.
COMBAT
A bebilith attacks any creature it sees. It usually picks one target
and concentrates its attacks on that opponent, using its webs to isolate the target from its comrades. Should the bebilith become overwhelmed by tougher opponents, it often attempts to bite one or
more of its victims and retreats, allowing its poison to do its work.
A bebilith’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial damage 1d6 Con,
secondary damage 2d6 Con.
Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing its potency and
becoming inert, foul-smelling goo
almost as soon as it comes into contact with air. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Rend Armor (Ex): If a
bebilith hits with both claw
attacks, it pulls apart any
armor worn by its foe.
This attack deals 4d6+18
points of damage to the
opponent’s armor. Creatures not wearing armor
are unaffected by this
special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is
destroyed. Damaged
armor may be repaired
with a successful Craft
( a r m o r s m i t h i n g )
check.
Web (Ex): A bebilith can throw a
web up to four times per day. This
is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 30
feet, with a range increment of 10 feet. This attack is effective
against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the
target in place, allowing no movement.
An entangled creature can escape with a DC 24 Escape Artist
check or burst the web with a DC 24 Strength check. The check
DCs are Constitution-based. The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. There is a 75% chance that the webbing will not burn if any
sort of fire is applied to it (check each round).
Plane Shift (Su): This ability affects only the bebilith. It is
otherwise similar to the spell (caster level 12th).
Skills: A bebilith has mottled coloration that gives it a +8 racial
bonus on Hide checks.

Bebilith
42
Advancement: 3–6 HD (Small)
Level Adjustment: +2
This humanoid-looking creature has a squat and blubbery, almost hairless
body, with pale, sickly flesh and a slack mouth full of small fangs.
Dretches are pathetic but wicked creatures that spend most of
their time milling about in mobs or serving as rank-and-file troops
in tanar’ri armies.
A dretch is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.
Dretches cannot speak but can communicate telepathically.
Combat
Dretches are slow, stupid, and not very effective combatants. In
one-on-one combat, they rely on their damage reduction to keep
them alive. In groups, they depend on sheer numbers to overcome
foes and immediately summon other dretches to improve the
odds in battle. They flee at the first sign of adversity unless more
powerful demons are present to intimidate them into fighting.
Dretches’ fear of their greater kin is stronger then even their fear
of death.
A dretch’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—scare (DC 12), stinking cloud (DC
13). Caster level 2nd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a dretch can attempt to
summon another dretch with a 35% chance of success. This ability
is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.
Telepathy (Su): Dretches can communicate telepathically
with creatures within 100 feet that speak Abyssal.

This creature is as tall as a giant, with a broad, muscular body. Its four
arms end in weapons—two with clawed hands, two with powerful pincers
Its doglike head is topped with horns, and its muzzle drips with sharp
fangs. Its eyes have a cold, dark, penetrating quality that suggests cunning
and intelligence.
Like succubi, glabrezu tempt victims into ruin, but they lure their
prey with power or wealth rather than passion.
Glabrezu have penetrating violet eyes, and their skin color
ranges from deep russet to pitch black. A glabrezu stands about 15
feet tall and weighs about 5,500 pounds.
Combat
Glabrezu prefer subterfuge to combat. However, if their attempts
to entice or deceive fail, these enormous demons attack with a vengeance. They follow a confusion attack with melee attacks, hoping to
finish off wounded foes with chaos hammer or unholy blight.
A glabrezu’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a glabrezu must hit a
Medium or smaller opponent with a pincer attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—chaos hammer (DC 19), confusion

teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), unholy blight (DC 19);
1/day—power word stun. Caster level 14th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.
Once per month, a glabrezu can fulfill a wish for a mortal humanoid. The demon can use this ability to offer a mortal whatever
he or she desires—but unless the wish is used to create pain and
suffering in the world, the glabrezu demands either terrible evil
acts or great sacrifice as compensation.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a glabrezu can attempt to
summon 4d10 dretches or 1d2 vrocks with a 50% chance of success, or another glabrezu with a 20% chance of success. This ability
is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.
True Seeing (Su): Glabrezu continuously use true seeing as the
spell (caster level 14th).
Skills: Glabrezu have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

This creature looks like a massive, roughly humanoid toad with arms in
place of forelegs. Its wide mouth has rows of blunt, powerful teeth, and
long spines run down the length of its back.
Hezrous are demonic sergeants, overseeing the formation of armies and commanding units in battle. They don’t have the scheming instincts of the more powerful demons, but hezrous are cunning in battle.
A hezrou can walk both upright and on all fours, but it always
fights standing up
A hezrou is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 750 pounds.
Combat
Hezrous enjoy melee combat even more than vrocks do. They
eagerly press an attack deep into the heart of enemy forces, so their
stench can take effect as quickly as possible. They enter most battles
by using blasphemy, and follow it with an occasional chaos hammer or
unholy blight, depending on the alignment of their opponents.
A hezrou’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a hezrou must hit with
both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—chaos hammer (DC 18), greater
teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), unholy blight (DC 18);
3/day—blasphemy (DC 21), gaseous form. Caster level 13th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
Stench (Ex): A hezrou’s skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic
liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons)
within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4
rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as
long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves
cannot be affected again by the same hezrou’s stench for 24 hours. A
delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes either condition from
one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected,
and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their
saving throws.. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a hezrou can attempt to
summon 4d10 dretches or another hezrou with a 35% chance of
success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.
Skills: Hezrous have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

DEMON
44
This large, otherworldly entity appears to be an attractive female human
with six arms—at least from her head to her waist. From the waist down,
the creature has the body of a massive snake with green, scaly coils.
Mariliths are generals and tacticians, often rivaling balors in sheer
brilliance and cunning. Some also serve as chief lieutenants for
major demon royalty.
A marilith usually holds a longsword in each of its six hands and
wears many bangles and jewels.
A marilith stands about 9 feet tall and measures about 20 feet
from head to tip of tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.
Combat
Though mariliths thrive on grand strategy and army-level tactics,
they love physical combat and never pass up an opportunity to
fight. Each of a marilith’s six arms can wield a weapon, and the
creature gets an additional three weapon attacks with its primary
arm. Mariliths seldom rush headlong into battle, however, preferring to hang back and size up the situation first. They always seek
to gain the best possible advantage from the local terrain, obstacles, and any vulnerability or weakness in their opponents.
A marilith’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Constrict (Ex): A marilith deals 4d6+13 points of damage with
a successful grapple check. The constricted creature must succeed on a DC
27 Fortitude save or lose consciousness for as
long as it remains in the coils and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The
save DC is Strength-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a marilith must hit
with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it succeeds on the grapple check, it can constrict.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—align weapon, blade barrier (DC
23), magic weapon, project image (DC 23), polymorph, see invisibility,
telekinesis (DC 22), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects
only), unholy aura (DC 25). Caster level 16th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a marilith can attempt to
summon 4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrou, or one nalfeshnee with a
50% chance of success, or one glabrezu or another marilith with
a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 5thlevel spell.
True Seeing (Su): Mariliths continuously use this ability, as the
spell (caster level 16th).
Skills: Mariliths have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.
Feats: In combination with its natural abilities, a marilith’s Multiweapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with all its arms at no
penalty.

DEMON
Nalfeshnee
Quasit
Succubus 45
This creature is a grotesque blending of an ape and a corpulent boar. It
stands on its hind legs, rising to more than three times the height of a
human. It has a pair of feathered wings that seem ridiculously small
compared to the rest of its body.
These enormous demons await the arrival of doomed souls
into the Abyss, where the nalfeshnees can judge them. Of
course, nalfeshnees relish the chance to begin the punishment
of the damned.
A nalfeshnee can fly despite its small wings.
A nalfeshnee is more than 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.
Combat
When fulfilling their duties in the underworld, nalfeshnees usually disdain combat as being beneath them. Given the opportunity, they succumb to blood lust and do battle. They disable opponents with their smite ability and slaughter them while they can’t
fight back.
A nalfeshnee’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Smite (Su): Three times per day a nalfeshnee can create a
nimbus of unholy light. When the demon triggers the ability, rainbow-colored beams play around its body. One round later they
burst in a 60-foot radius. Any creature within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of
its worst fears hound it. The creature receives its full Dexterity and
shield bonuses to AC if attacked but can take no actions. Other
demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—call lightning (DC 18), feeblemind
(DC 20), greater dispel magic, slow (DC 18), greater teleport (self plus
50 pounds of objects only), unholy aura (DC 23). Caster level 12th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Twice per day a nalfeshnee can attempt to
summon 1d4 vrocks, 1d4 hezrous, or one glabrezu with a 50%
chance of success, or another nalfeshnee with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.
True Seeing (Su): Nalfeshnees continuously use true seeing, as
the spell (caster level 14th).
Skills: Nalfeshnees have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

A tiny humanoid-shaped creature with spiky horns and bat wings hovers
nearby. Its hands and feet are long and slender, with long, claw-tipped
digits. Warts or pustules cover its greenish skin.
Quasits are insidious demons from the Abyss. They are often
found serving chaotic evil spellcasters as counselors and spies.
In its natural form, a quasit stands about 1-1/2 feet tall and
weighs about 8 pounds.
Quasits speak Common and Abyssal.
Combat
Although quasits thirst for victory and power as other demons do,
they are cowards at heart. They typically attack from ambush,
using their alternate form ability and invisibility to get within
reach, then try to scuttle away. When retreating, they use their
cause fear ability to deter pursuit.
A quasit’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex,
secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based
and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—detect good, detect magic, and invisibility (self only); 1/day—cause fear (as the spell, except that its area
is a 30-foot radius from the quasit, save DC 11). Caster level 6th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Once per week a quasit can use commune to ask six questions.
The ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).
Alternate Form (Su): A quasit can assume other forms at will
as a standard action. This ability functions as a polymorph spell cast
on itself (caster level 12th), except that a quasit does not regain hit
points for changing form, and any individual quasit can assume
only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms
include bat, monstrous centipede, toad, and wolf. A quasit in alternate form loses its poison attack.

DEMON
46
This creature looks like an enormous spider, standing twice as tall as a
human. Its forelegs end in massive cleavers. Four bulbous eyes, a malevolent gleam in each one, rise out of its carapace.
A retriever specializes in recovering lost or desired objects, runaway slaves, and enemies and bringing them back to its master.
Retrievers were created through foul sorcery to be warriors and
servants to powerful demon nobles. Most scholars believe retrievers are built to resemble bebiliths. More powerful demons often
use these mindless constructs to perform ugly tasks, or tasks they
could not trust to their own scheming kind.
A retriever has a body the size of an ox, with legs spanning more
than 14 feet. It weighs about 6,500 pounds.
Combat
Retrievers attack with four claws, but their eye rays are far more
deadly.
Eye Rays (Su): A retriever’s eyes can produce four different
magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one
ray as a free action. A particular ray is usable only once every 4
rounds. A retriever can fire an eye ray in the same round that it
makes physical attacks. The save DC for all rays is 18. The save DC
is Dexterity-based.
The four eye effects are:
Fire: Deals 12d6 points of fire damage to the target (Reflex half ).
Cold: Deals 12d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex half ).
Electricity: Deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to the target
(Reflex half ).
Petrification: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn
to stone permanently.
Find Target (Sp): When ordered to find an item or a creature, a
retriever does so unerringly, as though guided by discern location.
The being giving the order must have seen (or must have an
item belonging to) the creature to be found, or must have touched
the object to be located. This ability is the equivalent of an 8thlevel spell.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a retriever must hit
with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it
wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its mouth. This is the method by which it usually
“retrieves” things.

This creature is stunning, statuesque, and extraordinarily beautiful, with
flawless skin and raven hair. Her form, so tempting, also has an otherworldly side. Large bat wings unfurl from her back, and her eyes glow with
sinister desire.
Succubi are the most comely of the tanar’ri (perhaps of all demons),
and they live to tempt mortals.
A succubus is 6 feet tall in its natural form and weighs about
125 pounds.
Combat
Succubi are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If
forced to fight, they can attack with their claws, but they prefer to
turn foes against one another. Succubi use their polymorph ability
to assume humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign
friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with one of
them, whereupon the succubus applies her life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when
encountered within a dungeon.
A succubus’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Energy Drain (Su): A succubus drains energy from a mortal it
lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the
victim. If the target is not willing to be kissed, the succubus must
start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus’s kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also
DEMON
47
has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another kiss from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21
Will save to negate the effect of the suggestion. The DC is 21 for the
Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are
Charisma-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—charm monster (DC 22), detect
good, detect thoughts (DC 20), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of
objects only), polymorph (humanoid form only, no limit on duration), suggestion (DC 21), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of
objects only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a succubus can attempt to
summon 1 vrock with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the
equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
Tongues (Su): A succubus has a permanent tongues ability
(as the spell, caster level 12th). Succubi usually use verbal
communication with mortals.
Skills: Succubi have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and
Spot checks.
*While using her alter self ability, a succubus gains a +10 circumstance bonus
on Disguise checks.

This creature looks like a cross between a large human and a huge vulture.
It has strong, sinewy limbs covered with small gray feathers, a long neck
topped with a vulture head, and vast feathered wings.
Vrocks serve as guards to more powerful demons and as flying
assault troops in the abyssal wars.
A vrock is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.
Combat
Vrocks are vicious fighters who like to fly down into the enemy
and cause as much damage as possible. They prance about in
battle, taking briefly to the air and bringing their clawed feet into
play. Despite their advantage in mobility,
the vrocks’ deep love of battle frequently leads them into melee combats against heavy odds.
A vrock’s natural weapons, as
well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evilaligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Dance of Ruin (Su): To use
this ability, a group of at least
three vrocks must join hands in a
circle, dancing wildly and chanting. At the end of 3 rounds of
dancing, a wave of crackling
energy flashes outward in a
100-foot radius. All creatures
except for demons within
the radius take 20d6 points
of damage (Reflex DC 18
half ). Stunning, paralyzing,
or slaying one of the vrocks
stops the dance. The save DC
is Charisma-based.
Spell-Like Abilities:
At will—mirror image,
telekinesis (DC 18), greater teleport (self plus 50
pounds of objects only);
1/day—heroism. Caster level
12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spores (Ex): A vrock can release
masses of spores from its body once
every 3 rounds as a free action. The
spores automatically deal 1d8 points
of damage to all creatures adjacent
to the vrock. They then penetrate
the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage each
round for 10 rounds. At
the end of this time, the
victim is covered with a
tangle of viny growths. (The vines are harmless
and wither away in 1d4 days.) A delay poison spell stops the
spores’ growth for its duration. Bless, neutralize poison, or remove
disease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial
of holy water.
Stunning Screech (Su): Once per hour a vrock can emit a
piercing screech. All creatures except for demons within a 30-
foot radius must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned
for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Summon Tanar’ri (Sp): Once per day a vrock can attempt to
summon 2d10 dretches or another vrock with a 35% chance of
success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
Skills: Vrocks have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

A small, stocky dwarflike creature in studded leather armor titters and
mumbles to himself. His skin is a pale blue-white color, and his bulbous
white eyes have no irises or pupils. His hair is coarse and white, and a long
mustache droops past his chin.
Derro are degenerate and evil creatures of the underground, created from dwarf and human stock by some nameless deity of darkness and madness. Incredibly cruel and murderously insane, they
enjoy taking slaves and torturing surface dwellers (especially
humans) to death.
Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often
manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with an overpowering urge to inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable
of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of
time in order to cooperate with creatures of other races, but such
arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no
derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of his mind.
COMBAT
Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange
cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from hiding.
They delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later,
and favor traps and poisons that disable without killing.
Madness (Ex): Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will
saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity to
confusion and insanity effects. A derro cannot be restored to sanity
by any means short of a miracle or wish spell.
*The racial madness of the derro provides a +6 bonus to their
Charisma scores and a –6 penalty to their Wisdom scores. A
derro restored to sanity gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6
points of Charisma.
Poison Use (Ex): Derro typically carry 2d4 doses of greenblood
oil or Medium monstrous spider venom (see Poison, page 296 of
the Dungeon Master’s Guide), applying it to their crossbow bolts.
Derro are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling
poison.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Any time a derro’s opponent is denied his
Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a derro flanks his opponent, he deals
an extra 1d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue’s
sneak attack and subject to the same limitations.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—darkness, ghost sound; 1/day—
daze (DC 13), sound burst (DC 15). Caster level 3rd. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.
Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex): A derro takes 1 point of Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it
dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points
are recovered at the rate of 1 per every 24-hour period spent
underground or otherwise sheltered from the sun.
Skills: Derro have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently
checks.
DERRO CHARACTERS
Most derro revere Diirinka, a chaotic deity of magic and cruelty.
Very few derro are clerics, but those who follow this path can
choose two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil,
or Trickery.
The leaders of the derro are spellcasters called savants, whom
other derro follow fanatically. Derro savants are at least 5thlevel sorcerers; they have one to three Knowledge skills (usually arcana and other esoteric fields). A savant is accompanied
by two lower-level students. Savants use their spells to confuse
and frustrate rather than kill, preferring to make slaves of
defeated foes.

The creature shambles forward on thick, taloned legs. Vaguely reptilian in
form, its large, stooped frame ends in a mostly featureless head dominated
by large ear structures and a gaping, toothless mouth.
The dungeon-dwelling destrachan looks like some bizarre, nonintelligent beast, but it’s an incredibly evil and crafty sadist.
A destrachan has a pair of complex, three-part ears that it can
adjust to be more or less sensitive to various sounds. It is blind,
yet hunts with a sense of hearing more precise than most creatures’ sight.
From its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harDESTRACHAN
49
monics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a
stone wall. So skilled is a destrachan at controlling the sounds it
emits that it can choose what type of material to affect with
its attack.
Destrachans feed on death and misery. They haunt inhabited underground complexes, spreading woe for evil’s own sake. They can
blast their way through stone well enough to travel beneath the
surface as they wish. Sometimes a destrachan subdues its victims
and brings them back to its lair for torture and imprisonment.
No living thing would ever willingly ally itself with this monster, although sometimes undead or evil outsiders accompany a
destrachan as it attacks and slays other creatures.
A destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of
the tail and weighs about 4,000 pounds.
A destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If
a destrachan must communicate, it does so through action.
COMBAT
A destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes
weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with surprise
if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons
and then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.
Destructive Harmonics (Su): A destrachan can blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect
any creatures or objects within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the
harmonics of this destructive power to
affect different types of targets. All
save DCs are Charisma-based.
Flesh: Disrupting tissue
and rending bone, this
attack deals 4d6
points of damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).
Nerves: A destrachan can focus its harmonics to knock out foes
rather than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal
damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).
Material: When using this form of harmonics, a destrachan
chooses wood, stone, metal, or glass. All objects made of that material within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or
shatter. Objects (or portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit
points are potentially affected by this attack.
Blindsight (Ex): A destrachan can use hearing to ascertain all
foes within 100 feet as a sighted creature would.
Immunities: Destrachans have immunity to gaze attacks,
visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.
Protection from Sonics (Ex): While they can be affected by
loud noises and sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence), destrachans are less vulnerable to sonic attacks (+4 circumstance bonus
on all saves) because they can protect their ears. A destrachan
whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, and all
targets are treated as having total concealment.
Skills: A destrachan has a +10 racial bonus on Listen checks.
DEVIL
The scourge of humanity and the cosmos, devils are fiends from
the Nine Hells of Baator, a lawful evil realm. Devils enjoy bullying
those weaker than themselves and often attack good creatures just
to gain a trophy or three. The most powerful devils occupy themselves with plots to seize power, wreck civilizations, and inflict
misery upon mortals.
Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to
break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils
with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and
confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is
to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can
never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the
fray.
The most numerous devils are the
baatezu, infamous for their strength, evil
temperament, and ruthlessly efficient
organization. Baatezu have a rigid caste
system, in which authority derives not
only from power but also from station. They
occupy themselves mainly with extending
their influence throughout the planes by corrupting mortals. Baatezu who further this goal
are usually rewarded with improved stations.
Baatezu Traits: A baatezu possesses the following
traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Immunity to fire and poison.
—Resistance to acid 10 and cold 10.

This creature looks like a tall
humanoid covered with
sharp barbs, right down
to the tip of its long,
meaty tail. Its eyes shift
and dart about, making it appear agitated
or nervous.
Barbed devils, also
called hamatulas,
serve as guardians of vaults
and bodyguards to
the most powerful denizens of the Nine Hells.
A barbed devil is
about 7 feet tall and
weighs about 300
pounds.
Combat
Barbed devils eagerly fight with their claws, trying to impale their
opponents. They use hold person to immobilize those who avoid
their hug attacks.
A barbed devil’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Fear (Su): A creature hit by a barbed devil must succeed on a
DC 20 Will save or be affected as though by fear (caster level 9th).
Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be
affected by that same barbed devil’s fear ability for 24 hours. The
save DC is Charisma-based.
Impale (Ex): A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing
damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a barbed devil must hit
with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent
on its barbed body.
Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day a barbed devil can attempt
to summon 1d6 bearded devils or another barbed devil with a 35%
chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.
Barbed Defense (Su): Any creature striking a barbed devil
with handheld weapons or natural weapons takes 1d8+6 points of
piercing and slashing damage from the devil’s barbs. Note that
weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—greater teleport (self plus 50
pounds of objects only), hold person (DC 16), major image (DC 17),
scorching ray (2 rays only). 1/day—order’s wrath (DC 18), unholy
blight (DC 18). Caster level 12th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.

The first thing that stands out about this creature is the massive sawtoothed glaive it carries. The creature’s pointed ears and moist, scaly skin
mark it as an outsider. It has a long tail, clawed hands and feet, and a
snaky, disgusting beard.
Bearded devils, also called barbazu, serve as shock troops in
hell’s armies, spearheading attacks by masses of lemures.
Between wars, they find employment as guards and sentinels
for more powerful devils. Every bearded devil carries a sawtoothed glaive.
A bearded devil stands 6 feet tall and weighs
about 225 pounds.
Combat
Bearded devils are aggressive and
love to fight. They revel in their
battle frenzy, spreading mayhem
among their foes.
A bearded devil’s natural
weapons, as well as
any weapons it wields,
are treated as evilaligned and lawfulaligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—
greater teleport (self
plus 50 pounds
of objects only).
Caster level 12th.
Infernal Wound
(Su): The damage a
bearded devil deals
with its glaive
causes a persistent
wound. An injured
creature loses 2 additional hit points each round. The wound does not heal naturally
and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be
stopped by a DC 16 Heal check, a cure spell, or a heal spell. However, a character attempting to cast a cure spell or a heal spell on a
creature damaged by a bearded devil’s glaive must succeed on a DC
16 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful Heal check automatically stops the continuing
hit point loss as well as restoring hit points. The infernal wound is
a supernatural ability of the bearded devil, not of the weapon. The
check DC is Constitution-based.
Beard (Ex): If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both
claw attacks, it automatically hits with its beard. The affected creature takes 1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 16
Fortitude save or be infected with a vile disease known as devil
chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). Damage is
dealt each day until the afflicted creature succeeds on three consecutive Fortitude saves, the disease is cured magically, or the creature dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Battle Frenzy (Ex): Twice per day, a bearded devil can work
itself into a battle frenzy similar to the barbarian’s rage (+4
Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 morale bonus on Will saves, –2 AC
penalty). The frenzy lasts for 6 rounds, and the bearded devil suffers no ill effects afterward.
Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day a bearded devil can attempt
to summon 2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of success, or another
bearded devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the
equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

This tall creature looks skeletal and wretched, almost a husk of a humanoid form, with dried skin stretched so tight as to outline and emphasize every bone. It has a fearsome, skull-like head and a tail like a
scorpion’s, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it.
Bone devils, also called osyluths, often serve as
the police and informers of the Nine Hells,
monitoring other devils’ activities and reporting on their service.
Bone devils stand about 9 feet tall and
weigh about 500 pounds.
Combat
Bone devils hate all other creatures and
attack ruthlessly. They freely use wall
of ice to keep the enemy divided.
A bone devil’s natural weapons,
as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawfulaligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Fear Aura (Su): Bone devils can
radiate a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a
free action. Affected creatures must
succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be
affected as though by a fear spell
(caster level 7th). A creature that
successfully saves cannot be affected
again by the same bone devil’s aura for
24 hours. Other baatezu are immune

The clank and rattle of chains announces the arrival of this creature. It appears human in shape and size, but chains wrap it like
a shroud, every length ending in a hook or a blade or a heavy
ball. The chains seems to slither and slide over the creature’s
form, almost as if they were alive.
These chain-shrouded beings, also called kytons,
are often mistaken for undead by those who liken
them to the traditional shackle-rattling ghost.
Kytons are humanlike devils, wrapped in
chains instead of clothing.
A chain devil is 6 feet tall and weighs about
300 pounds, chains included.
Chain devils speak Infernal and Common.
Combat
A chain devil attacks by flailing away with the
spiked chains that serve as its clothing, armor,
and weapons. Chain devils savor fear and
terror so much that they may stalk victims
for hours, building dread and panic prior
to attacking.
A chain devil’s natural weapons, as
well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawfulaligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Dancing Chains (Su): A chain devil’s most awesome attack is
its ability to control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard
action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition,
a chain devil can increase these chains’ length by up to 15 feet and
cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as
effectively as the devil itself. If a chain is in another creature’s possession, the creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the
chain devil’s power over that chain. If the save is successful, the
kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24
hours or until the chain leaves the creature’s possession. The save
DC is Charisma-based.
DEVIL

A chain devil can climb chains it controls at its normal speed
without making Climb checks.
Unnerving Gaze (Su): Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A
chain devil can make its face resemble one of an opponent’s
departed loved ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves
take a –2 penalty on attack rolls for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Regeneration (Ex): Chain devils take normal damage from silvered weapons, good-aligned weapons, and spells or effects with
the good descriptor.
A chain devil that loses a piece of its body regrows it in 2d6×10
minutes. Holding the severed member against the stump enables
it to reattach instantly.
Skills: Chain devils have a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks
involving metalwork.

A fierce and beautiful woman, with a statuesque build and flawless skin,
stands nearby. She has large, feathery wings and red, glowing eyes. She
wields a longsword, and a shining red bow is strapped across her back.
Rumor in the underworld tells that the first erinyes were angels
who fell from their lofty heights because of some temptation or
misdeed. Now, the skies of the Nine Hells are litterered with their
descendants. Erinyes serve as scouts, servants, and even concubines for powerful devils. Unlike other devils, erinyes appear
attractive to humans, resembling very comely women or men.
They’re not above taking advantage of being mistaken for the
celestials that legend says they once were.
An erinyes stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.
Erinyes speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.
Combat
Erinyes prefer to engage in combat from a distance. They use
charm monster to distract or disorganize their opponents, then rain
down fiery arrows from above.
An erinyes’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Entangle (Ex): Each erinyes carries a stout rope some 50 feet
long that entangles opponents of any size as an animate rope spell
(caster level 16th). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no
range penalty. Typically, an erinyes entangles a foe, lifts it into the
air, and drops it from a great height.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—greater teleport (self plus 50

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day an erinyes can attempt to
summon 2d10 lemures or 1d4 bearded devils with a 50% chance of

Silently, with grace and power, a creature emerges on the path ahead.
It has the shape of an enormous lion, but its form consists of blinding
light and fiery sparks, as though its body were made of energy and not
flesh and bone.
These fierce devil-cats, also called bezekiras, move about almost
silently, constantly on the watch for some chance to do evil. They
enjoy setting ambushes and otherwise outwitting enemies. While
its appearance suggests it is incorporeal, a hellcats has a corporeal
body and can be harmed by physical attacks.
Hellcats use a natural telepathy to communicate with one
another and those they encounter. A hellcat measures about 9 feet
long and weighs about 900 pounds.

Combat
A hellcat can hold its own in combat thanks to sharp claws and
wicked fangs. It prefers to leap upon opponents, just as a lion
does.
A hellcat’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are

Improved Grab (Ex): To use
this ability, a hellcat must hit

including two rake
attacks.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus
+13 melee, damage 1d8+3.
Invisible in Light

any area lit well enough for a
human to see. In a darkened
area, it shows up as a faintly glowing outline visible up to 30 feet away (60 feet if the viewer has

conceals the outline.

This creature is as big as an ogre, with a vaguely humanoid shape.
Hideous scales sheathe its body. Huge wings and a snaking, prehensile tail add to its intimidating appearance.
Horned devils, also called cornugons,
serve as elite defense forces, the soldiers supreme of the Nine Hells.
They are terrible to look upon—
even to other devils.
A horned devil is 9 feet tall
and weighs about 600
pounds.
Combat
Horned devils are bold
fighters. They rarely retreat, even against overwhelming odds. They love
to fight with their spiked
chains, usually singling
out the most powerful foes
to stun and eliminate quickly.
A horned devil’s natural weapons, as
well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and
lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—dispel chaos (DC 21), dispel good

immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Stun (Su): Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain
attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be
stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. This ability is a function of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain.
Infernal Wound (Su): The damage a horned devil deals with
its tail attack causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses
2 additional hit points each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can
be stopped by a DC 24 Heal check, a cure spell, or a heal spell. However, a character attempting to cast a cure spell or a heal spell on a
creature damaged by a horned devil’s tail must succeed on a DC 24
caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful Heal check automatically stops the continuing

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day a horned devil can attempt
to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils with a 50% chance
of success, 1d6 barbed devils with a 35% chance of success, or
another horned devil with a 20% chance of success. This ability is
the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.

Combat
An ice devil prefers to fight only when doing so serves its mission,
but it never hesitates to attack when it deems a battle necessary—
or likely to end in its victory.
An ice devil’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Fear Aura (Su): An ice devil can radiate a 10-foot-radius fear
aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC
22 Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell (caster level
13th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again
by the same ice devil’s aura for 24 hours. Other baatezu are
immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Slow (Su): A hit from an ice devil’s tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or
be affected as though by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—cone of cold (DC 20), fly, ice storm
(DC 19), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), persistent image (DC 20), unholy aura (DC 23), wall of ice (DC 19). Caster
level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day an ice devil can attempt to
summon 2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils, 2d4 bone devils
with a 50% chance of success, or another ice devil with a 20%
chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.
Regeneration (Ex): An ice devil takes normal damage from
good-aligned weapons and from spells or effects with the good
descriptor.

A tiny humanoid with leathery batwings, a barbed tail, and sharp, twisted
horns flutters at about eye level, winking into sight from out of thin air.
Imps are insidious devils. They are often found serving lawful evil
spellcasters as advisors and spies.
In its natural form, an imp stands almost 2 feet tall and weighs
about 8 pounds.
Combat
Imps are craven, but not so timid as to pass up an opportunity for a
surprise attack using their invisibility and alternate form ability. In
its natural form, an imp attacks with the wicked stinger on its tail. It
quickly flies out of reach if a foe manages to strike back effectively.
An imp’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex,
secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based
and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—detect good, detect magic, invisibility
(self only); 1/day—suggestion (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The save
DC is Charisma-based.
Once per week an imp can use commune to ask six questions.
The ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).
Alternate Form (Su): An imp can assume other forms at will
as a standard action. This ability functions as a polymorph spell
cast on itself (caster level 12th), except that an imp does not regain
hit points for changing form, and an individual imp can assume
only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms
include monstrous spider, raven, rat, and boar.

Lemures are mindless and

sensitive to telepathic messages from
other devils, typically obeying a
devil’s mental commands.
Combat
Lemures crave revenge against the universe that has made them
what they are. They surge toward anything they meet and try to
claw it apart. Only a telepathic command from other devils or the
complete destruction of the lemures can make them stop.
A lemure’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Cloaked in fire and as tall as two humans, this hulking monster spreads
its batlike wings and cracks its whiplike tail. Great scales cover its body
like armor. It smiles, revealing large fangs that drip with a hissing

Pit fiends are the undisputed lords of the baatezu, masters of
creating fear in mortals and devils alike.
A pit fiend often wraps its wings around itself like a grotesque
cloak, and appears wreathed in flames.
A pit fiend is 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.

Combat
Pit fiends are wily and resourceful fighters, using invisibility to
gain the upper hand and biting at foes seemingly able to see them.
They don’t hesitate to blanket an area with fireballs, and can call
down the wrath of an inferno with meteor swarm.
A pit fiend’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Constrict (Ex): A pit fiend deals 2d8+26 points of damage with
a successful grapple check.
Disease (Su): A creature struck by a pit fiend’s bite attack must
succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be
infected with a vile disease known
as devil chills (incubation period
1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Fear Aura (Su): A pit fiend can
radiate a 20-foot-radius fear aura as a
free action. A creature in the area must
succeed on a DC 27 Will save or be
affected as though by a fear spell (caster
level 18th). A creature that successfully
saves cannot be affected again by the same
pit fiend’s aura for 24 hours. Other baatezu
are immune to the aura. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a
pit fiend must hit with its tail slap attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 27, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage
death. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—blasphemy (DC 25), create undead, fireball (DC
21), greater dispel magic, greater teleport (self
plus 50 pounds of objects only), invisibility,
magic circle against good, mass hold monster
(DC 27), persistent image (DC 23), power word
stun, unholy aura (DC 26); 1/day—meteor
swarm (DC 27). Caster level 18th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
Once per year a pit fiend can use wish as the
spell (caster level 20th).
Summon Baatezu (Sp): Twice per day a pit fiend
can automatically summon 2 lemures, bone devils,
or bearded devils, or 1 erinyes, horned devil, or ice
devil. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
Regeneration (Ex): A pit fiend takes normal damage
from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or
effects with the good descriptor.
Tactics Round-by-Round
A pit fiend typically opens combat by using its spelllike abilities, attempting to neutralize dangerous
opponents before entering melee.
Prior to combat: Unholy aura; activate fear aura,
summon baatezu.
Round 1: Quickened fireball and mass hold monster if facing three or more visible, active opponents; otherwise power word stun against unarmored opponent
(preferably a spellcaster).
Round 2: Meteor swarm against as many foes as possible,
approach worst-injured enemy.
Round 3: Full attack against injured enemy.
Round 4: Continue melee against injured enemy, or power word
stun against annoying spellcaster.
Round 5: Repeat from round 1, or greater teleport to safety if
endangered.

This tall, skeletal creature has strands of
mummified flesh hanging from its bones.
Imprisoned within the creature’s rib cage is a tiny
figure, clearly in agony.
Devourers are massive creatures every bit as evil as
they look. They lurk on the Ethereal Plane and the
Astral Plane, stalking both natives and travelers with
equal sadistic glee.
The tiny figure in the rib cage is the trapped
essence of a slain opponent, which is consumed
like firewood to sustain the monster’s unnatural life.
A devourer is about 9 feet tall and weighs 500
pounds.
Devourers speak Common.
COMBAT
Even if it had no special abilities, a devourer would
be a terrible opponent, for its bony claws can flay
enemies alive.
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a
devourer’s claw attack or spectral hand ability gain
one negative level. The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save
to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charismabased.
Trap Essence (Su): The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy’s life essence. To do so, it must
forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack.
This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The
DEVOURER

affected creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or die
instantly. The save DC is Charisma-based.
A slain creature’s essence is trapped within the devourer’s ribs,
and the tiny figure takes on that victim’s features. The trapped
essence cannot be raised or resurrected, but a limited wish, miracle,
or wish spell frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer
can hold only one essence at a time.
The trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to
use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped
creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away
until it evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one negative level for every five times the devourer uses one of its spelllike abilities. When the essence’s number of negative levels
equals the creature’s total Hit Dice or level, the essence is
destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose that
level permanently.
Spell-Like Abilities: At the start of any encounter, the trapped
essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels
(enough fuel for thirty to seventy-five uses). Once per round, a
devourer can use one of the following abilities: confusion (DC 17),
control undead (DC 20), ghoul touch (DC 15), lesser planar ally, ray of
enfeeblement (DC 14), spectral hand, suggestion (DC 16), true seeing.
Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spell Deflection (Su): The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at
the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the
imprisoned essence instead: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion,
crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear,
geas/quest, holy word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. In many
cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell (charming a
trapped essence, for example, is useless). Some of these effects
(banishment, for example) might eliminate the trapped essence,
depriving the devourer of its spell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.

This creature stands on two powerful hind legs. It has a long tail, but
no other limbs, and a gray, pebbly hide with daggerlike markings. Its
narrow head is equipped with a sucking mouth and a tubelike orifice in
its forehead.
The swift predators known as digesters have a vicious acid attack
that can reduce a human to a pool of glop in seconds. Digesters
may lurk almost anywhere there is prey to be found, from barren
deserts to steaming jungles.
A digester stands about 5 feet tall and is 7 feet long from snout
to tail. It weighs about 350 pounds,
COMBAT
A digester is a hunting and eating machine. When it is not
hungry (which is rarely), it lies low and avoids most other creatures. When hunting, it looks about for a likely target, then
charges forth and delivers a gout of acid. If the initial attack is
insufficient to kill the prey, the digester attacks with its hind feet
until it can spray acid again.
Acid Spray (Ex): A digester can spray acid in a 20-foot cone,
dealing 4d8 points of damage to everything in the area. Once a
digester uses this ability, it can’t use it again until 1d4 rounds later.
The creature can also produce a concentrated stream of acid that
deals 8d8 points of damage to a single target within 5 feet. In
either case, a DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Skills: A digester’s coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on
Hide checks. It also has a +4 racial bonus on Jump checks.

DINOSAUR
Dinosaurs, or terrible lizards, are ancient beasts that may be
related to dragons.
Among the traits that predatory dinosaurs share with many
dragons are sharp teeth, a savage disposition, a well-developed
sense of territory, and a ruthless capacity to hunt. Herbivorous
dinosaurs usually are not aggressive unless wounded or defending
their young, but may attack if startled or harassed.
Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have
drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more colorful markings. Most dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture.
Dinosaurs most often live in rugged or isolated areas that
humanoids seldom visit: remote mountain valleys, inaccessible
plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.
COMBAT
Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift
carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until they can get
into charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently
overrun and trample their opponents.

This lean, long-legged bipedal creature has wicked-looking claws on its feet
and a brightly colored hide that reminds you of a tropical bird. It stands
about as tall as a human, and its outstretched tail makes it least twice as
long as it is tall.
This fast carnivore is sometimes called a velociraptor, though that
name properly belongs to a much smaller creature.
A deinonychus is bright green along its back and flanks, with a
much lighter shade of the same color on its underside. The body
has darker spots or stripes. Its tail extends straight out behind
itself, held aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus
allowing its weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. It
weighs about 600 pounds.
Combat
A deinonychus uses a combination of speed, grasping forearms,
large teeth, and hind legs with ripping talons. It hunts by running
at prey, leaping, and ripping with its rear talons as it claws and
bites. The talons count as one attack.
A deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a dinosaur, and its
pack hunts with cunning tactics.
Pounce (Ex): If a deinonychus charges, it can make a full
attack.
Skills: A deinonychus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Jump,

An elasmosaurus has a total length of some 30 feet, including a

Combat
An elasmosaurus is aggressive and attacks anything it notices. The

A tyrannosaurus eats almost anything it can
sink its teeth into, and spends a great deal of its
time scavenging for carrion and chasing smaller
carnivores away from their kills.
Combat
A tyrannosaurus pursues and eats just about anything it sees. Its tactics are simple—charge in
and bite.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tyrannosaurus must hit an opponent of up to one size
smaller with its bite attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking

damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the tyrannosaurus’s gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by
using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of
damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once the creature exits, muscular
action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its
own way out.

Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.
Skills: A tyrannosaurus has a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot

DISPLACER BEAST
PACK LORD
Due to the bizarre nature of their anatomy, displacer beasts are unusually likely to produce mutant offspring. These whelps can grow to tremendous size, reaching a length of 20 feet
and standing almost 10 feet high at the
shoulder. Pack lords, as these gigantic displacer beasts are known, frequently lead bands of
their smaller fellows.
Except for their freakish size and strength, pack
lords resemble normal displacer beasts.

This gaunt, gray-skinned humanoid has long,
gangly limbs and a bulbous head with large,
octopoid eyes. Its face is otherwise blank
and featureless.
Doppelgangers are strange beings that are able to take on the
shapes of those they encounter. In its natural form, the creature
looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly
limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its
large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils.
A doppelganger’s appearance is deceiving even when it’s in
its true form. A doppelganger is hardy, with a natural agility
not in keeping with its frail appearance.
Because they can take the shape of any humanoid between 4
and 8 feet tall, doppelgangers are natural spies and assassins.
They can sneak past sentries, slip into secured places, and
fool even lovers or close friends. They are cunning and
patient, willing to wait until an opportunity presents itself
instead of attacking rashly.
Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid
society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only
in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be
manipulated and deceived.
It is natural form a doppelganger is about 5-1/2 feet tall
and weighs abut 150 pounds.
COMBAT
When in its natural form, a doppelganger strikes with its
powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other
armed person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its detect thoughts ability to
employ the same tactics and strategies as the person it is impersonating.
Detect Thoughts (Su): A doppelganger can continuously
use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 13
negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
The save DC is Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su): A doppelganger can assume the shape
of any Small or Medium humanoid. In humanoid form, the
doppelganger loses its natural attacks. A doppelganger can
remain in its humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new
one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a doppelganger
reverts to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell or
ability reveals its natural form.

DRAGON, TRUE
True dragons are winged, reptilelike creatures of ancient lineage.
They are known and feared for their size, physical prowess, and
magical abilities. The oldest dragons are among the most powerful
creatures in the world.
The known varieties of true dragons (as opposed to other creatures that have the dragon type) fall into two broad categories:
chromatic and metallic. The chromatic dragons are black, blue,
green, red, and white; they are all evil and extremely fierce. The
metallic dragons are brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver; they
are all good, usually noble, and highly respected by the wise.
All true dragons gain more abilities and greater power as they
age. (Other creatures that have the dragon type do not.) They
range in length from several feet upon hatching to more than 100
feet after attaining the status of great wyrm. The size of a particular dragon varies according to age and variety.
Though they are fearsome predators, dragons scavenge when
necessary and can eat almost anything if they are hungry enough.
A dragon’s metabolism operates like a highly efficient furnace and
can metabolize even inorganic material. Some dragons have
developed a taste for such fare.
Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons
are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of
coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as
possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for
long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate
area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as
enough treasure. It’s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its
radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping
nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time a dragon
matures to the age of great wyrm, hundreds of gems and coins
may be imbedded in its hide.
All dragons speak Draconic.
COMBAT
A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, and can also use
a breath weapon and special physical attacks, depending on its
size. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has
worn down the enemy with ranged attacks. Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating
the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off
weaker enemies).
The accompanying table provides space and reach statistics for
dragons of various sizes, plus the natural weapons a dragon of a
certain size can employ and the damage those attacks deal.
Bite: Bite attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon’s
Strength bonus. A dragon also can use its bite to snatch opponents
if it has the Snatch feat (see page 304).
Claw: Claw attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the
dragon’s Strength bonus (round down). The dragon also can use its
claws to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch feat (see page 304).
Claw attacks are secondary attacks, requiring a –5 penalrty on the
attack roll. (Many dragons choose the Multiattack feat to lessen
this penalty to –2).
Wing: The dragon can slam opponents with its wings, even
when flying. Wing attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the
dragon’s Strength bonus (round down) and are treated as secondary attacks.
Tail Slap: The dragon can slap one opponent each round with
its tail. A tail slap deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the
dragon’s Strength bonus (round down) and is treated as a secondary attack.
Crush (Ex): This special attack allows a flying or jumping
dragon of at least Huge size to land on opponents as a standard
action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are
effective only against opponents three or more size categories
smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or
grapple attacks against larger opponents).
A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the
dragon’s body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a
Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon) or be
pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next
round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to
maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don’t escape.
A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the
dragon’s Strength bonus (round down).
Tail Sweep (Ex): This special attack allows a dragon of at least
Gargantuan size to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The

10 Ancient 801–1,000
11 Wyrm 1,001–1,200

68
sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or
40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an
intersection on the edge of the dragon’s space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are
affected if they are four or more size
categories smaller than the dragon.
A tail sweep automatically deals the
indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the
dragon’s Strength bonus (round down).
Affected creatures can attempt Reflex
saves to take half damage (DC equal to that
of the dragon’s breath weapon).
Grappling: Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though their crush attack (and
Snatch feat, if they know it) use normal
grapple rules.
A dragon can always use its breath
weapon while grappling, as well as its spells
and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on Concentration checks.
Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a
standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can’t
breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If a dragon has
more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only
once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts
at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon’s choice, with an area as noted on the table
below. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the
area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends
on the dragon’s age and variety, and is given in each individual
entry. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same
DC; the kind of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions.
The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon’s HD +
dragon’s Con modifier.
Breath weapons come in two basic shapes, line and cone, whose
areas vary with the dragon’s size.
Dragon Breath Weapons
Dragon Size Line* (Length) Cone** (Length)
Tiny 30 ft. 15 ft.
Small 40 ft. 20 ft.
Medium 60 ft. 30 ft.
Large 80 ft. 40 ft.
Huge 100 ft. 50 ft.
Gargantuan 120 ft. 60 ft.
Colossal 140 ft. 70 ft.
*A line is always 5 feet high and 5 feet wide.
**A cone is as high and wide as its length.
Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can
unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect
automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies
overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet × the dragon’s age
category are subject to the effect if they have
fewer HD than the dragon.
A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a
Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon’s HD + dragon’s Cha modifier)
remains immune to that dragon’s frightful presence
for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or
less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds
and those with 5 or more HD become
shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore
the frightful presence of other dragons.
Spells: A dragon knows and casts
arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level
indicated in its variety description, gaining bonus spells for a high Charisma
score. Some dragons can also cast spells
from the cleric list or cleric domain lists as
arcane spells.
Spell-Like Abilities: A dragon’s spelllike abilities depend on its age and variety.
It gains the abilities indicated for its age plus all
previous ones. Its age category or its sorcerer caster level,
whichever is higher, is the caster level for these abilities. The save
DC is 10 + dragon’s Cha modifier + spell level. All spell-like abilities are usable once per day unless otherwise noted.
Damage Reduction: Young adult and older dragons have
damage reduction. Their natural weapons are treated as magic
weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Immunities (Ex): All dragons have immunity to sleep and
paralysis effects. Each variety of dragon has immunity to one or
two additional forms of attack no matter what its age, as given in
its description.
Spell Resistance (Ex): As dragons age, they become more
resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the variety descriptions.
Blindsense (Ex): Dragons can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents the dragon can’t actually see still have
total concealment against the dragon.
Keen Senses (Ex): A dragon sees four times as well a human in
shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light. It also has
darkvision out to 120 feet.
Skills: All dragons have skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier,
minimum 1) × (Hit Dice + 3). Most dragons purchase the following
skills at the maximum ranks possible: Listen, Search, and Spot. The
remaining skill points are generally spent on Concentration,
Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (any), Sense
Motive, and Use Magic Device at a cost of 1 skill point per rank. All
these skills are considered class skills for dragons. (Each dragon has
other class skills as well, as noted in the variety descriptions.)
Feats: All dragons have one feat, plus an additional feat per 3
Hit Dice, just like any other creature. Dragons favor Alertness,
Blind-Fight, Cleave, Flyby Attack, Hover, Improved Initiative,
Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Snatch, Weapon Focus (claw or
bite), Wingover, and any metamagic feat that is available and
useful to sorcerers.

Dragon Overland Movement
Chromatic and metallic dragons are exceedingly strong flyers
and can cover vast distances quickly. A dragon’s overland flying
speed is a function of its tactical fly speed, as shown on the
table below.
Dragon Overland Flying Speeds
————— Dragon’s Fly Speed —————
100 feet 150 feet 200 feet 250 feet
One Hour
Normal 15 miles 20 miles 30 miles 40 miles
Hustle 24 miles 40 miles 60 miles 80 miles
One Day
Normal 120 miles 160 miles 240 miles 320 miles
Dragons do not tire as quickly as other creatures when moving
overland on the ground. If a dragon attempts a hustle or a forced
march, check for nonlethal damage once every 2 hours instead of
every hour (see page 164 of the Player’s Handbook).
DRAGON SOCIETY
Although all dragons are believed to have come from the same
roots tens of thousands of years ago, the present varieties keep to
themselves and cooperate only under extreme circumstances,
such as a powerful mutual threat. Good dragons never work with
evil dragons, however, though a few neutral specimens have
been found with either. Gold dragons occasionally associate
with silver dragons.
When evil dragons of different varieties encounter one another,
they usually fight to protect their territories. Good dragons are
more tolerant, though also very territorial, and usually try to work
out differences in a peaceful manner.
Dragons follow a number of reproductive strategies to suit
their needs and temperaments. These help assure the continuation of a dragon’s bloodline, no matter what happens to the
parent or the parent’s lair. Young adults, particularly evil or less
intelligent ones, tend to lay clutches of 1d4+1 eggs all around
the countryside, leaving their offspring to fend for themselves.
These hatch into clutches of dragons, usually juvenile or
younger, which stick together until they can establish their
own lairs.
Older and more intelligent dragons form families consisting of
a mated pair and 1d4+1 young. Mated dragons are always adults or
mature adults; offspring found with their parents are of wyrmling
(01–10 on d%), very young (11–30), young (31–50), juvenile
(51–90), or young adult (91–100) age. Shortly after a dragon
reaches young adult (or rarely, juvenile) age, it leaves its parents to
establish a lair of its own.
A pair of mated dragons beyond mature adult age usually
splits up, independence and the lust for treasure driving them
apart. Older females continue to mate and lay eggs, but only
one parent stays in the lair to raise young. Often an older
female lays many clutches of eggs, keeping one to tend herself
and one for her mate, and leaving the rest untended. Sometimes
a female dragon places an egg or a wyrmling with nondraconic
foster parents.
DRAGONHIDE
Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce
armor or shields of masterwork quality (see Dragonhide under
Special Materials, page 283 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

Chromatic dragons form the evil branch of dragonkind. They are
aggressive, greedy, vain, and nasty.

The dragon’s head looks decidedly like a skull thanks to its deep-socketed
eyes and wide, flat nasal opening. It has forward-curving horns and a
spinal crest that peaks just behind the head and tapers off about three
quarters of the way down the neck. An acidic smell surrounds the dragon,
whose scales are mostly dull ebony and dark gray.
Black dragons are evil-tempered, cunning, and malevolent, characteristics that are reflected in their crafty, sinister faces.
Black dragon are sometimes known as skull dragons because
of their skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the
gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn
and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and
does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon’s scales

are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become
larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in
swamps and marshes.
Black dragons lair in large, damp caves and multichambered underground caverns. They smell of rotting vegetation and foul
water, with an acidic undertone. Older dragons hide the entrance
to their lairs using plant growth. Black dragons dine primarily on
fish, mollusks, and other aquatic creatures. They also hunt for red
meat but like to “pickle” it by letting it lie in ponds within the lair
for days before eating it.
Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold,
silver, and platinum coins before killing them.
Combat
Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps
and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees
and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to
leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.
Breath Weapon (Su): A black dragon has one type of breath
weapon, a line of acid.
Water Breathing (Ex): A black dragon can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other
abilities while submerged.
Corrupt Water (Sp): Once per day an adult or older black dragon
can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still, foul,
and unable to support animal life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Magic items (such as
potions) and items in a creature’s possession
must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to
that of the dragon’s frightful presence) or become fouled. This
ability is the equivalent of
a 1st-level spell. Its
range is equal to
that of the dragon’s frightful
presence.

Charm Reptiles (Sp): A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability
three times per day. It works as a mass charm spell that affects only

The dragon has dramatic frilled ears and a single massive horn emerging
from its snout. The smell of ozone lingers in the air near the dragon, whose
azure-tinged scales glitter in the sun.
Blue dragons are vain and territorial. They are one of the dragon
varieties best adapted to digging into sand.
A blue dragon’s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure
to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing
desert sands. The size of its scales increases little as
the dragon ages, although they do become
thicker and harder. Its hide tends to
hum and crackle faintly with builtup static electricity. These effects
intensify when the
dragon is angry or
about to attack, giving
off an odor of ozone and
sand.
Their vibrant color
makes blue dragons easy
to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often
burrow into the sand so only
part of their heads are exposed.
Blue dragons love to soar in the
hot desert air, usually flying in
the daytime when temperatures
are highest. Some nearly match
the color of the desert sky and
use this coloration to their
advantage.
Blue dragons lair in vast
underground caverns, where
they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything
that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems—especially sapphires. They are sometimes are forced to eat snakes, lizards, and
desert plants to sate their great hunger but especially prefer
herd animals such as camels. When they get the chance, they
gorge themselves on these creatures.
Combat
Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the
sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use
their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain, in concert with
these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are
severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.
Breath Weapon (Su): A blue dragon has one type of breath
weapon, a line of lightning.
Create/Destroy Water (Sp): A blue dragon of any age can use
this ability three times per day. It works like the create water
spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead
of creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids
containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a
creature’s possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to

is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.
Sound Imitation (Ex): A juvenile or older blue dragon can
mimic any voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners
must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s
frightful presence) to detect the ruse.

older); 1/day—hallucinatory terrain (old or older), veil (ancient or

The dragon has a toothy, curving jaw line and rows of hornlets over its
eyes. There is a cluster of hornlets at the chin. A crest begins just behind
the eyes and runs the length of the body, rising to full height just behind
the skull. The odor of chlorine clings to the dragon, whose scales radiate
with a glowing emerald shine.
Green dragons are belligerent and tend to attack without provocation.
A wyrmling green dragon’s scales are thin, very small, and a
deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon
ages, the scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest,
emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its
wooded surroundings.
Green dragons make their lairs in forests; the older the forest
and bigger the trees, the better. They prefer caves in cliffs or hillsides and can be detected by the stinging odor of chlorine. Although they have been known to eat practically anything, including shrubs and small trees when they are hungry enough, green
dragons especially prize elves and sprites.

Combat
Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems
formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to determine
the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon
makes its presence known quickly—it enjoys
evoking terror. Sometimes the dragon
elects to control a humanoid creature through intimidation and
suggestion. Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their
society and abilities, what is
going on in the countryside, and
if there is treasure nearby.

The dragon has horns extending back over the neck, frilled
ears, and smaller horns at the
cheeks and chin, with rows of horns
over the brows. The nose is beaklike and
sports a small horn. A frill begins behind
the head and runs to the tip of the tail. The
dragon reeks of smoke and sulfur, and its
scales shine with shades of crimson and scarlet.
Red dragons are the most covetous of all dragons,
forever seeking to increase their treasure hoards.
They are exceptionally vain, which is reflected in
their proud bearing and disdainful expression.
The small scales of a wyrmling red dragon are a
bright glossy scarlet, making the dragon easily spotted by predators and hunters, so it stays underground
and does not venture outside until it is more able to
take care of itself. Toward the end of young age, the
scales turn a deeper red, and the glossy texture is
replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the dragon
grows older, the scales become
large, thick, and as strong
as metal. The neck frill
and wings are an ash blue
or purple-gray toward the
edges, becoming darker
with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as it ages; the oldest red
dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.
Red dragons lair in large caves that extend deep into the earth,
which shimmer with the heat of their bodies and are marked by a
sulfurous, smoky odor. However, they always have a high perch
nearby from which to haughtily survey their territory, which they
consider to be everything in sight. This high perch sometimes
intrudes upon the territory of a silver dragon, and for this reason
red dragons and silver dragons are often enemies.
Red dragons are meat eaters by preference, and their favorite
food is a human or elven youth. Sometimes they charm villagers
into regularly sacrificing townsfolk to them.
Combat
Because red dragons are so confident,
they seldom pause to appraise an
adversary. On spotting a target,
they make a snap decision
whether to attack,

The dragon has a beaked nose, spiny dewlaps, and a crest supported by a
single, back-curving spine. A crisp, faintly chemical odor accompanies the
dragon, whose scales glisten like snow.
Among the smallest and least intelligent of dragonkind, most
white dragons are simply animalistic predators. Their faces
express single-minded ferocity rather than the shrewdness of
their more powerful kin.
The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten like mirrors. As
the dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by very old age, scales
of pale blue and light gray are mixed in with the white.
White dragons’ lairs are usually icy caves and deep underground chambers that open away from the warming rays of the
sun. They store all of their treasure within the lair, preferably in
caverns coated in ice, which reflect the gems. White dragons are
especially fond of diamonds.
Although white dragons are able to eat nearly anything, they
are very particular and will consume only food that has been
frozen. Usually a dragon devours a creature killed by its breath
weapon while the carcass is still stiff and frigid. It buries other
kills in snowbanks until they are suitably frozen.

White dragons’ natural enemies are frost giants, who kill the
dragons for food and armor and capture them to use as guards.
Combat
White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft
or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their
breath weapon, then try to knock out a single opponent with a
follow-up attack.
Breath Weapon (Su): A white dragon has one type of breath
weapon, a cone of cold.
Icewalking (Ex): This ability works like the spider climb spell,
but the surfaces the dragon climbs
must be icy. It is
always in
effect.
Freezing Fog (Sp): An old or older white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to a solid fog spell but also causes
a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease
effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.
Other Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—fog cloud (juvenile or
older), gust of wind (adult or older), wall of ice (ancient or older);
1/day—control weather (great wyrm).
Skills: Hide, Move Silently, and Swim are considered class
skills for white dragons.

The dragon’s head has a
massive plate at the forehead and
bladelike horns at the chin.
A frill runs the length of the
neck, and the dragon has mantalike wings. The dragon smells like
sunbaked sand, and its scales glisten like polished brass.
Brass dragons are notoriously talkative. They may have useful
information, but usually share it only after long rambling and
hinting for a gift.
At birth, a brass dragon’s scales are a dull, mottled brown. As
the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they
reach a warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a
brass dragon are smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin
horns that grow sharper with age. Wings and frills are mottled
green toward the edges, darkening with age. As the dragon
grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble molten
metal orbs.
Brass dragons love intense, dry heat and spend most of their
time basking in the desert sun. They are accompanied by a tangy
metallic or sandy odor. They lair in high caves, preferably facing
east to enjoy the morning warmth, and their territories always
contain several spots where they can sunbathe and trap unwary
travelers in conversation.
Brass dragons can and will eat almost anything if the need
arises, but they normally consume very little. They are able to get
nourishment from the morning dew, a rare commodity in their
habitat, and have been seen carefully lifting it off plants with their
long tongues.
Because they share similar habitats, blue dragons are brass dragons’ worst enemies. The larger blues have the advantage in oneon-one confrontations, so
brass dragons
usually try to
evade them until
they can rally their
neighbors for a mass
attack.
Combat
Brass dragons would rather talk
than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to leave without
engaging in conversation, the
dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique, using suggestion or a dose of sleep gas. A
creature put to sleep may wake
to find itself pinned or buried to
the neck in the sand
until the dragon’s
thirst for small talk is
slaked. When faced
with real danger,
younger brass dragons
fly out of sight, then

The dragon has a ribbed and fluted crest sweeping back from its cheeks
and eyes. The ribs in the crests end in curving
horns. The dragon also has small horns
on its lower jaw and
chin. It has a
beaklike snout and
a small head frill, as
well as a tall neck frill.
The scent of the sea
surrounds the dragon,
and its scales have a
metallic, golden
brown cast.
Bronze dragons are inquisitive and
enjoy polymorphing into
small, friendly animals to
observe adventurers. They are
fascinated by warfare, eagerly
joining an army for a
just cause—and
good pay.
A bronze wyrmling’s scales are
yellow tinged with
green, showing only
a hint of bronze. As
the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens
slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop
a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers,
they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its
eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble
glowing green orbs.
Bronze dragons like coastal hills near deep fresh water or salt
water. They often visit the depths to cool off or hunt for pearls
and sunken treasure. They prefer caves that are accessible only
from the water, but their lairs are always dry—they do not lay
eggs, sleep, or store treasure underwater. A smell of sea spray
lingers about
them. Bronze
dragons eat aquatic plants
and some varieties of seafood. They
especially prize shark meat. They also
dine on the occasional pearl.
Combat
Bronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather
bribe them (perhaps
with food) or force them away
magically. They use detect thoughts
to learn intelligent creatures’ intentions. When attacking they blind their
opponents with fog cloud and then charge or,
if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring
opponents they conjure up a storm or use
their tails to smash the vessels’ hulls.
If a dragon is inclined to be
lenient, ships might
be merely becalmed, fogbound,
or broken-masted.
Breath Weapon
(Su): Bronze dragons
have two types of
breath weapon, a
line of lightning and a cone

The dragon has massive thighs and shoulders, with a short face and broad,
smooth brow plates jutting over the eyes. Long, flat horns extend back
from the brow plates in a series of overlapping segments. The dragon
also has backswept cheek ridges and frills on the backs of the lower jaws
that sweep forward slightly. Layers of triangular blades point down from
the chin. The dragon has an acrid odor, and its reddish scales have a
metallic shine.
Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers. Most are good-natured but also have a covetous, miserly
streak. They are powerful jumpers and climbers.
At birth, a copper dragon’s scales have a ruddy brown color with
a metallic tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer
and more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by young adult age.
Very old dragons’ scales pick up a green tint. A copper dragon’s
pupils fade with age, and the eyes of great wyrms resemble glowing turquoise orbs.
Copper dragons like dry, rocky uplands
and hilltops. They lair in narrow caves
and often conceal the entrances using
move earth and stone shape. Within

the lair, they construct twisting mazes with open tops that allow
the dragon to fly or jump over intruders.
Copper dragons are determined hunters, considering good
sport at least as important as the food. They are known to eat
almost anything, including metal ore. However, they prize monstrous scorpions and other large poisonous creatures (they say the
venom sharpens their wit).
Because copper dragons often inhabit hills in sight of red dragons’ lairs, conflicts between the two varieties are inevitable. The
smaller coppers usually run for cover until they can even the odds.
Combat
A copper dragon appreciates wit and usually doesn’t harm creatures that can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon
has not heard before. It quickly gets annoyed with anyone who
doesn’t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. It
likes to taunt and annoy opponents into giving up or acting
foolishly.
An angry copper dragon prefers to mire foes using transmute rock
to mud. The dragon pushes trapped opponents into the mud or
snatches and carries them aloft. A copper dragon tries to draw airborne enemies into narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider
climb ability and maneuver them into colliding with the walls.
Breath Weapon (Su): A copper dragon has two types of breath
weapon, a line of acid and a cone of slow gas. Creatures within the
cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be slowed for 1d6 rounds
plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.
Spider Climb (Ex): A copper dragon can climb on stone surfaces as though using the spider climb spell.
Spell-Like Abilities: 2/day—stone shape (adult or older);
1/day—transmute rock to mud or mud to rock (old or older), wall of
stone (ancient or older), move earth (great wyrm).
Skills: Bluff, Hide, and Jump are considered class skills for
copper dragons.

The dragon has large, smooth, twin horns that sweep back from its nose
and brow. Twin frills adorn its long neck, and whiskers around its mouth

the barbels
of a catfish. Its
saillike wings start

trace down to the tip of its

and incense, and its scales glisten like

Gold dragons are graceful,
sinuous, and wise. They
hate injustice and foul
play, often embarking on
self-appointed quests to
promote good. A gold
dragon often assumes human or

adult stage, the scales are completely golden. Gold dragons’ faces
are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until
the eyes resemble pools of molten gold.
Gold dragons can live anywhere. Their lairs are secluded and
always made of stone, whether caves or castles. These usually have
loyal guards: animals appropriate to the terrain, storm giants, or
good cloud giants. Giants usually form a mutual defensive agreement with a dragon.
Gold dragons usually sustain themselves on pearls or small
gems. Such gifts are well received, as long as they are not bribes.
Combat
Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing
with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive
to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ bless and their
luck bonus; older dragons use their luck bonus at the start of each
day. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their
favorites are cloudkill, delayed blast fireball, fire shield, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow, and stinking cloud.
Breath Weapon (Su): A gold dragon has two types of breath
weapon, a cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas. Creatures
within a cone of weakening gas must succeed on a Fortitude save
or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category of the
dragon.
Alternate Form (Su): A gold dragon can assume any animal
or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard
action three times per day. This ability functions as a polymorph
spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does
not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the
form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its
animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one
or return to its natural form.
Water Breathing (Ex): A gold dragon can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and
other abilities while submerged (the cone of fire becomes a cone
of superheated steam underwater).
Luck Bonus (Sp): Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can
touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon’s hide, and
enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the
gem, it and every good creature in a 10-foot radius per age category
of the dragon receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and
similar rolls, as for a stone of good luck (see the item description,
page 267 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). If the dragon gives an
enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the
bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of
the dragon but ends if the gem is destroyed. This ability is the
equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Detect Gems (Sp): An old or older gold dragon can use this ability
three times per day. This is a divination effect similar to a detect
magic spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a
60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if
there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration
reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact
location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.
Other Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—bless (juvenile or older);
1/day—geas/quest (old or older), sunburst (ancient or older), foresight (great wyrm).
Skills: Disguise, Heal, and Swim are considered class skills for
gold dragons.

A smooth, shiny plate forms the dragon’s face. It has a frill that rises high
over its head and continues down the neck and back to the tip of the tail.
Long spines with dark tips support the frill. It has two smooth, shiny horns,
and wings that are wide and sleek. The dragon has the scent of rain, and
its scales gleam like liquid metal.
Silver dragons are regal and statuesque. They cheerfully assist
good creatures that are in genuine need and often take the forms
of kindly old men or fair damsels when associating with humans.
A silver wyrmling’s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its
color gradually brightens until the individual
scales are scarcely visible.
From a distance, these dragons
look as if they have been sculpted
from pure metal. Silver dragons are
sometimes known as shield dragons
because of the silvery plates on their heads.
As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade
until in the oldest the eyes resemble orbs of
mercury.
Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded
mountain peaks or amid the clouds themselves.
A faint smell of rain always accompanies them.
Even in clouds, though, the lair always has a magical area with a solid floor for laying eggs and
storing treasure.
Silver dragons seem to prefer human form
to their own, and they often have mortal companions, even forming deep friendships.
Inevitably, however, a dragon resumes its
true form and departs for a time. Silver
dragons have a taste for human cuisine
and can live on such fare indefinitely.
Because they lair in similar territories, silver dragons and red dragons
often come into conflict. Duels between the two varieties are furious and
deadly, but silver dragons generally
get the upper hand by working
together against their foes, often with human allies.
Combat
Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when
faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use fog
cloud or control weather to blind or confuse opponents before

attacking. When angry, they use reverse gravity to fling enemies
helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. Against flying
opponents, a silver dragon hides in clouds (creating some with
control weather on clear days), then jumps to the attack when it has
the advantage.
Breath Weapon (Su): A silver dragon has two types of breath
weapon, a cone of cold and a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures
within a cone of paralyzing gas must succeed on a Fortitude save
or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the
dragon.
Alternate Form (Su): A silver dragon can assume any animal
or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard
action three times per day. This ability functions as a polymorph
spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does
not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the
form of an anirmal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its
animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one
or return to its natural form.
Cloudwalking (Su): A silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog
as though on solid ground. The ability functions continuously but
can be negated or resumed at will.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—fog cloud (adult or older), control
winds (old or older); 2/day—feather fall (juvenile or older); 1/day—
control weather (ancient or older), reverse gravity (great wyrm).
Skills: Bluff, Disguise, and Jump are considered class skills for

This huge creature has a wide, streamlined shell with jagged protrusions.
A long neck emerges from one end of the shell, ending in a crested head
with sharp-lined jaws. Taloned flippers extend from holes along the sides
of the shell, and a long tail snakes from the rear of the shell.
Dragon turtles are among the most beautiful, awesome, and feared
creatures of the water. Deadly jaws, steaming breath, and a penchant for capsizing ships make them dreaded by mariners.
A surfacing dragon turtle is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the water.
Its rough, deep green shell is
much the same color as the
deep water the monster
favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell
resemble light dancing on
open water. The turtle’s
legs, tail, and head are a
lighter green, flecked
with golden highlights. An
adult dragon turtle can measure from 20 to 30 feet from
snout to tail, with a shell from
15 to 25 feet in diameter, and
can weigh 8,000 to 32,000 pounds.
Dragon turtles speak Aquan, Draconic, and Common.
COMBAT
Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and
generally attack any creature that
threatens their territory or looks like a
potential meal.
Breath Weapon (Su): Cloud of superheated steam 20 feet high,
25 feet wide, and 50 feet long, once every 1d4 rounds, damage
12d6 fire, Reflex DC 21 half; effective both on the surface and
underwater. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Capsize (Ex): A submerged dragon turtle that surfaces under a
boat or ship less than 20 feet long capsizes the vessel 95% of the
time. It has a 50% chance to capsize a vessel from 20 to 60 feet long
and a 20% chance to capsize one over 60 feet long.
Skills: A dragon turtle has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.
*Dragon turtles have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when
submerged.

Part giant lion and part dragon, the creature has a pair of small,
brass-colored wings sprouting from its shoulders. It is covered
with brass-colored scales, and its mane is thick and coarse.
Possessing some of the most dangerous qualities of a lion
and a brass dragon, the dragonne is a vicious and deadly hunter.
Dragonnes are not necessarily aggressive toward strangers. Their
reputation as remorseless devourers of helpless travelers is more
the product of ignorance than well-researched fact. A dragonne
almost always attacks a creature that invades its lair or threatens its
territory, so adventurers who stumble across its cave or settlers who
attempt to set up camp in the area are often subject to fierce and
immediate retaliation. Those not threatening the dragonne’s lair or
simply passing through its territory are usually left alone.
Dragonnes prefer herd animals such as goats for food, especially
since they don’t fight back as fiercely as humanoids. They attack
humanoids only if no other game is available.
A dragonne possesses huge claws and fangs, and large eyes, usually the color of its scales. A dragonne is about 12 feet long and
weighs about 700 pounds.
Dragonnes speak Draconic.
COMBAT
A dragonne’s wings are useful only for short flights, carrying the
creature for 10 to 30 minutes at a time. Nevertheless, it uses its
wings effectively in battle. If opponents attempt to charge or
encircle it, the dragonne simply takes to the air and finds a more
defensible position.
Pounce (Ex): If a dragonne charges, it can make a full attack in
the same round.
Roar (Su): A dragonne can loose a devastating roar every 1d4
rounds. All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become fatigued. Those within 30
feet who fail their saves become exhausted. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Skills: Dragonnes have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a dragonne is up to 348
pounds; a medium load, 349–699 pounds, and a heavy load,
700–1,050 pounds.

DRIDER
Illus. by C. Arellano
89
This strange being has the head and torso of a dark elf and the legs and
lower body of a giant spider.
Driders are bloodthirsty creatures that lurk in the depths of the
earth, seeking warm-blooded prey of any kind.
Driders are created by the drow’s dark goddess, Lolth. When a
dark elf of above average ability reaches 6th level, the goddess may
put him or her through a special test. Those who fail the test
become driders.
Because they have failed their goddess’s test, driders are outcasts
from their own communities. Drow and driders hate one another
passionately.
Driders speak Elven, Common, and Undercommon.
COMBAT
Driders seldom pass up an opportunity to
attack other creatures, especially from
ambush. They usually begin with a spell
assault and often levitate out of the
enemy’s reach.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 16,
initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The
save DC is Constitution based.
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—dancing
lights (DC 13), clairaudience/clairvoyance, darkness, detect good, detect law, detect magic, dispel
magic, faerie fire, levitate, suggestion (DC 16).
Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Charismabased.
Spells: Driders cast spells as 6th-level
clerics, wizards, or sorcerers. Drider clerics
can choose from the following domains:
Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Trickery. The
typical spells prepared shown here are for a
drider sorcerer.
Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/7/6/4, base
save DC 13 + spell level): 0—daze, detect
magic, ghost sound, mage hand, ray of frost, read
magic, resistance; 1st—mage armor, magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, silent image; 2nd—
invisibility, web; 3rd—lightning bolt.
Skills: A drider has a +4 racial bonus on
Hide and Move Silently checks. It has a +8
racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check,
even if rushed or threatened.

Level Adjustment: —
The creature blossoms out of the bark of the
ancient tree, at first appearing as a new branch
before solidifying into a decidedly female
shape. She has a wild, unfathomable look in
her large, almond-shaped eyes, and her hair
has a pronounced, leafy texture, while her skin
looks like burnished wood.
Dryads are wild, mysterious entities
found deep in secluded woodlands. They
defend the trees from any who would
fell them and sometimes come into conflict with humans and others who take
wood from the forests. Dryads have been
known to charm adventurers into helping them defend their homes or hunting
down the forest’s enemies—even if
those enemies are human loggers and
woodcutters.
Dryads remain something of a mystery
even to other woodland beings. Tales tell
of dryads who took a fancy to handsome
elf or human men, charmed them, and
held them captive. But since dryads rarely
associate with any outside their own kind,
these stories may be purely apocryphal.
Dryads are more likely to ensnare intruders
and then send their charmed “guests” out to
deal with threats the dryads cannot handle.
A dryad’s delicate features are much like a
female elf ’s, though her flesh is like bark or
fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of
leaves that changes color with the seasons.
Although they are generally solitary, up to
seven dryads have been encountered in one
place on rare occasions.
Dryads speak Common, Elven, and Sylvan.
COMBAT
Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as
elusive as they are alluring—they avoid
physical combat and are rarely seen unless
they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of
an ally, a dryad uses charm person or suggestion, attempting to gain control of the
attacker(s) who could help the most against
the rest. Any attack on her tree, however,
provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—entangle
(DC 13), speak with plants, tree shape; 3/day—
charm person (DC 13), deep slumber (DC 15),
tree stride; 1/day—suggestion (DC 15). Caster
level 6th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.
Tree Dependent (Su): Each dryad is mystically bound
DRYAD
90 Dryad
to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than
300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6
hours. A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic.
Wild Empathy (Ex): This power works like the druid’s wild
empathy class feature, except that the dryad has a +6 racial bonus
on the check.
DWARF
Stocky, broad of body and extremely muscular, the short figure before you
may lack in height but not in physical strength or presence. Wrapped in
metal armor and armed with a waraxe, the humanoid has light brown
skin, ruddy cheeks, and bright eyes, with black hair and a long, carefully
groomed beard and mustache.
Dwarves are noble warriors who excel at metalcraft, stoneworking,
and war. They tend to be serious, determined, and very honorable.
Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer
simple and functional garb. The skin can be very dark, but it is
always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black,
gray, or brown. Dwarves average 4 feet tall and weigh as much
as adult humans.
Dwarves prefer to spend their time making masterpieces of
stone, steel, and precious metals. They create durable weapons, craft
beautiful jewelry, and cut superior gems. However, they consider it
bad taste to flaunt wealth, so few wear jewelry other than one
simple piece.
Dwarves speak Dwarven. Most who travel outside dwarven
lands (as traders, mercenaries, or adventurers) know the Common
tongue, while warriors in the dwarven cities usually learn
Goblin to better interrogate and spy on those evil denizens of
the deep caves.
Most dwarves encountered outside their home are warriors.
COMBAT
Dwarves are experts in combat, effectively using their environment and executing well-planned group attacks. They rarely use
magic in fights, since they have few wizards or sorcerers (but
dwarven clerics throw themselves into battle as heartily as their
fellow warriors). If they have time to prepare, they may build
deadfalls or other traps involving stone. In addition to the dwarven waraxe and thrown hammer, dwarves also use warhammers,
picks, shortbows, heavy crossbows, and maces.
Dwarf Traits (Ex): Dwarves possess the following racial traits.
— +2 Constitution, –2 Charisma.
—Medium size.
—A dwarf ’s base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can
move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or
when carrying a medium or heavy load.
—Darkvision out to to 60 feet.
—Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus
on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding
walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to
match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and
the like. Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone
also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes
within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as
if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search
skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also
intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as
naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Dwarves have a
sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get
plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground homes.
—Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and
dwarven urgroshes (see Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook) as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.

DWARF SOCIETY
Dwarves prefer living in underground cities that they build around
mines (although some live on surface outposts). Carved into solid
stone, these cities take centuries to complete but remain for ages.
Dwarf society is organized into clans, with distinct family lines
within each. A clan is led by a hereditary ruler, usually a king or
queen who is a direct descendant of the clan’s founder. Dwarves are
strongly loyal to their family, clan, monarch, and people as a whole;
in conflicts with other races, even objective dwarves tend to side
with their kinfolk. These ties have helped dwarves survive generations of warfare against the evil creatures that live under the earth.
A dwarven city has noncombatant members (usually the young,
elderly, and a few adults) equal to 30% of the fighting population;
female dwarves are as numerous as males and are accepted in any
part of dwarf society, including warriors.
Dwarf clans usually focus on one or two types of craft, such as
blacksmithing, making weapons or armor, creating jewelry, engineering, or stonemasonry. To avoid becoming overspecialized,
dwarves apprentice some of their young ones to other clans; this
practice also helps foster unity. Since dwarves live a long time, these
apprenticeships can last many years, even well into adulthood.
The chief dwarven deity is Moradin, the god who created their
race and the patron of smiths and other skilled craftworkers.
SUBRACES
The information above is for hill dwarves, the most common variety. There are three other major dwarven subraces, which differ
from hill dwarves as follows.
Deep Dwarf
These dwarves live far underground and tend to be more standoffish with nondwarves.
Deep dwarves are the same height as other dwarves, but leaner.
Their skin sometimes has a reddish tinge, and their large eyes lack
the brightness of those of their kindred, being a washed-out blue.
Their hair color ranges from bright red to straw blond. They have
little contact with surface dwellers, relying on hill dwarves or
mountain dwarves to trade goods for them.
Deep dwarves speak Dwarven and Goblin, and occasionally
Draconic or Undercommon.
Deep Dwarf Traits (Ex): These traits are in addition to the
hill dwarf traits, except where noted.
—Racial bonus on saves against spells and spelllike abilities increases to +3.
—Racial bonus on Fortitude saves against
poisons increases to +3.
—Darkvision out to 90 feet.
—Light Sensitivity: Deep dwarves are
dazzled in bright sunlight or within
the radius of a daylight spell.
Duergar
Sometimes called gray dwarves,
these evil beings dwell in the
underground.
Most duergar are bald (even the
females), and they dress in drab clothing
that is designed to blend into stone. In their
lairs they may wear jewelry, but it is always kept
dull. They war with other dwarves, even allying
with other underground creatures from time to
time.
The duergar revere the deity Laduguer, a
joyless god who demands constant toil.
Duergar speak Dwarven and Undercommon.
Duergar Traits (Ex): These traits are in
addition to the hill dwarf traits, except where
noted.
— –4 Charisma instead of –2.
—Darkvision out to 120 feet.
—Immunity to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. This trait
replaces the hill dwarf ’s +2 racial bonus on saving throws against
poison.
— +2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities.
—Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—enlarge person and invisibility as a
wizard of twice the duergar’s class level (minimum caster level 3rd);
these abilities affect only the duergar and whatever it carries.
—Light Sensitivity: Duergar are dazzled in bright sunlight or
within the radius of a daylight spell.
— +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.
— +1 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
—Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven, Undercommon.
Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This trait
replaces the hill dwarf ’s automatic and bonus languages.
—Favored Class: Fighter.
—Level adjustment +1
—Unlike other dwarves, duergar do not have weapon familiarity with the dwarven waraxe and dwarven urgrosh.
The duergar warrior presented here had the following ability
scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10,
Wis 9, Cha 8.
Challenge Rating: Duergar with levels in NPC classes have a

Mountain Dwarf
Mountain dwarves live deeper under the mountains than hill
dwarves but generally not as far underground as deep dwarves.
They average about 4-1/2 feet tall and have lighter skin and hair
than hill dwarves, but the same general appearance. They claim they
were the first dwarf race and that all other dwarves are descended
from them, an attitude that contributes to their isolationism.

Giant eagles are intelligent, keen-eyed birds of prey that sometimes associate with good creatures.
Giant eagles attack creatures that appear threatening, especially
those intent on raiding the eagles’ nest for eggs or fledglings,
which fetch a handsome price in many civilized areas. Young
eagles can be trained and are prized as aerial mounts.
A typical giant eagle stands about 10 feet tall, has a wingspan of
up to 20 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way
except size. It weighs about 500 pounds.
Giant eagles speak Common and Auran.
COMBAT
A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving earthward at tremendous speed. When it cannot dive, it uses its powerful talons and slashing beak to strike at its target’s head and eyes.
A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the
vicinity of its nest and generally ignores creatures that do not
appear threatening. A mated pair attacks in concert, making
repeated diving attacks to drive away intruders, and fights to the
death to defend their nest or hatchlings.
Evasion (Ex): With a successful Reflex save against an attack
that allows a Reflex save for half damage, a giant eagle takes no
damage.
Skills: Giant eagles have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.
TRAINING A GIANT EAGLE
Although intelligent, a giant eagle requires training before it can
bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant eagle must have a
friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through
a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant eagle
requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.
Riding a giant eagle requires an exotic saddle. A giant eagle can
fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless
he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
Giant eagle eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market,
while chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge
1,000 gp to rear or train a giant eagle.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a giant eagle is up to 300
pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load,
601–900 pounds.
ELADRIN
The eladrins are a celestial race native to
the plane of Arborea. They are knights and
lords who roam the cosmos in search of good
folk to aid. Eladrins are free-spirited, but they
are also mighty champions of good.
COMBAT
Eladrins are deadly and resolute foes of evil, fearless and clever in battle.
Eladrin Traits: An eladrin possesses the following
traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Immunity to electricity and petrification.
—Resistance to cold 10 and fire 10.
—Tongues (Su): All eladrins can speak with any
creature that has a language, as though using a
tongues spell (caster level 14th). This ability is
always active.

The being before you resembles a short, stocky elf, broad in the
shoulders but quick and nimble. Its hair is a bright
silver-white, and its eyes are an ever-changing rainbow of hues.
The bralanis are the wildest and most feral of their
kind, existing from heartbeat to heartbeat in a glorious, never-ending passion. In addition to
their natural form,
bralanis can assume the shape of
a whirlwind or
zephyr of dust,
snow, or sand.
Bralanis speak
Celestial, Infernal,
and Draconic, but can communicate
with almost any creature, thanks to their
tongues ability.
Combat
Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons
of the desert nomads they most closely resemble.
A bralani’s natural weapons, as well as any
weapons it wields, are treated as chaoticaligned and good-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—
blur, charm person
(DC 13), gust of wind
(DC 14), mirror
image, wind wall;
2/day—lightning bolt (DC
15), cure serious
wounds (DC 15).
Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Whirlwind Blast (Su): When in whirlwind form, a bralani
can attack with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of
damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 16 half ). The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Alternate Form (Su): A bralani can shift between its humanoid and whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form,
it cannot fly or use its whirlwind blast, but it can use its spell-like
abilities and its weapons. In whirlwind form, it can fly, make slam
attacks and whirlwind blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities.
A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new
one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani
revert to any particular form when killed. A true seeing spell, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.

This creature resembles an elf with a noble bearing. It has pearly, opalescent eyes and seems to give off a radiant aura.
Ghaeles are the knights-errant of the celestials. Wherever evil and
tyranny raise their ugly heads, the ghaeles respond. Working
behind the scenes more than other eladrins, ghaeles quietly
muster resistance and offer guidance to any of good heart with the
courage to stand against their oppressors.
A ghaele can take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch
colors, 5 feet in diameter.
A ghaele is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds.
Ghaeles speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their tongues ability.
Combat
Ghaeles who enter combat prefer direct confrontation and damaging attacks to more subtle or insidious methods. They usually fight
in their humanoid form, wielding incandescent +4 holy
greatswords. If a ghaele desires mobility, it assumes its globe form
and blasts the enemy with light rays.
A ghaele’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—aid, charm monster (DC 17), color
spray (DC 14), comprehend languages, continual flame, cure light wounds
(DC 14), dancing lights, detect evil, detect thoughts (DC 15), disguise self,
dispel magic, hold monster (DC 18), greater invisibility (self only), major
image (DC 16), see invisibility, greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of
objects only); 1/day—chain lightning (DC 19), prismatic spray (DC 20),
wall of force. Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spells: Ghaeles in humanoid form can cast divine spells as
14th-level clerics. A ghaele has access to two of the following domains: Air, Animal, Chaos, Good, or Plant (plus any others from its
deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.
Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 13 + spell
level): 0—cure minor wounds, detect magic, guidance, light, resistance,
virtue; 1st—bless, calm animals*, command, divine favor, obscuring
mist, sanctuary, shield of faith; 2nd—aid, align weapon, bear ’s
endurance, hold animal*, lesser restoration, remove paralysis, zone of
truth; 3rd—daylight, gaseous form*, prayer, remove curse, searing light,
water breathing; 4th—death ward, dismissal, divine power, restoration,
summon nature’s ally IV (animal)*; 5th—control winds*, flame strike,
raise dead, true seeing; 6th—banishment, blade barrier, chain lightning*,
heal; 7th—animal shapes*, holy word, summon monster VII.
*Domain spell. Domains: Air and Animal.
Gaze (Su): In humanoid form—slay evil creatures of 5 or less
HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds,
the creature is affected as though by a fear spell for 2d10 rounds.
Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must
succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the fear effect. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.
Light Ray (Ex): A ghaele in globe form can project light rays
with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction
of any type.
Alternate Form (Su): A ghaele can shift between its humanoid
and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot
fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like
abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it
can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot
cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and
the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form.
A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new
one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele
revert to any particular form when killed. A true seeing spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.
Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus
to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone
within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a magic
circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both
with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals ghaele’s HD). (The
defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a ghaele’s
statistics block.)
ELEMENTAL
Elementals are incarnations of the elements that compose existence.
They are as wild and dangerous as the forces that birthed them.
COMBAT
Elementals have varied combat abilities and tactics, but all have
the same elemental qualities.
AIR ELEMENTAL
This creature appears to be an amorphous, shifting cloud surrounded by
fast-moving currents of air. Darker bits of twirling vapor form the suggestion of two eyes and a mouth, but this could be a trick of the swirling air.
Air elementals are among the swiftest and most agile creatures in
existence. They seldom leave their home plane except when summoned elsewhere by a spell.
Air elementals speak Auran, though they rarely choose to do so.
The voice of an air elemental sounds like the high-pitched screech
of a tornado or the low moan of a midnight storm.
Combat
Their rapid speed makes air elementals useful on vast battlefields
or in extended aerial combat.
Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on
attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.
Whirlwind (Su): The elemental can transform itself into a
whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up
to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can
move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.
The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at
the top, and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the elemental’s size.
The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least
10 feet.
The elemental’s movement while in whirlwind form does not
provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the
space another creature occupies. Another creature might be
caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if
the elemental moves into or through the creature’s space.
Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the
ELEMENTAL
95
table below for details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected
creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact
with the whirlwind or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated
damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save
each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes
damage but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves
against the whirlwind’s effects varies with the elemental’s size (see
the table). The save DC is Strength based.
Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go
where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind.
Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but
must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to
cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty to
Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have

only as many creatures trapped inside the whirlwind at one time
as will fit inside the whirlwind’s volume.
The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it
wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A
summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before
returning to its home plane.
If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling
cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a
diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures
all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet
away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.
An elemental in whirlwind form cannot make slam attacks and
does not threaten the area around it.

EARTH ELEMENTAL
Like a walking hill, the creature plods nearer on two featureless legs of rock
and earth, its clublike arms of jagged stone swinging at its sides, and its
featureless head staring blankly in your direction.
Earth elementals are immensely strong and tough.
The larger ones can pound almost anything into
rubble. They seldom leave their home plane
except when summoned elsewhere by a spell.
When summoned to the Material Plane, an
earth elemental consists of whatever types of
dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was
conjured from.
Earth elementals speak Terran but
rarely choose to do so. An earth elemental’s voice sounds like an echo in a deep
tunnel, the rumbling of an earthquake,
or the grinding of plates of stone.
Combat
Though an earth elemental moves
slowly, it is a relentless opponent. It can travel though
solid ground or stone as
easily as humans walk on
the earth’s surface. It cannot
swim, however, and must
either walk around a body
of water or go through
the ground under it.
An earth elemental can
move along the bottom of
a body of water but prefers not to.
Earth Mastery (Ex): An earth
elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack
and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If
an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a –4
penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not
included in the statistics block.)
Push (Ex): An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver
without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery, above, also apply to the elemental’s
opposed Strength checks.
Earth Glide (Ex): An earth elemental can glide through
stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as
easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind
no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of
its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
FIRE ELEMENTAL
A mass of ambulatory flame races across the ground, seeming to flicker and
spark from a central, humanoid-shaped conflagration. Like a living
inferno, the fire-creature’s burning dance of heat and flame brings it ever
closer.
Fire elementals are fast and agile. The merest touch from their
fiery bodies is sufficient to set many materials aflame.
A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable
liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it.
Fire elementals speak Ignan, though they rarely choose to do so.
When one speaks, its voice sounds like the crackle and hiss
of a great fire.
Combat
A fire elemental is a fierce opponent
that attacks its enemies
directly and savagely. It takes
joy in burning the creatures and
objects of the Material Plane to
ashes.
Burn (Ex): A fire elemental’s
slam attack deals bludgeoning
damage plus fire damage from the
elemental’s flaming body. Those hit
by a fire elemental‘s slam attack also
must succeed on a Reflex save
or catch on fire. The flame
burns for 1d4 rounds. The
save DC varies with the elemental’s size (see the
table below). A burning
creature can take a move
action to put out the
flame. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take
fire damage as though hit by the elemental’s attack, and
also catch on fire unless they succeed on a Reflex save.

Small 4 ft. 1 lb. 11
Medium 8 ft. 2 lb. 14
Large 16 ft. 4 lb. 17
Huge 32 ft. 8 lb. 22
Greater 36 ft. 10 lb. 24
Elder 40 ft. 12 lb. 26
WATER ELEMENTAL
A vortex of water rolls across the ground, though it never seems to crash or
lose its shape. The waves cascade and storm around a central, humanoidshaped whirlpool, with watery appendages that pound with the force of an
ocean storm.
A water elemental can be as ferocious and powerful as a stormy sea.
A water elemental can’t venture more than 180 feet from the
body of water from which it was conjured.
Water elementals speak Aquan but rarely choose to do so.
When one speaks, its voice sounds like the crashing of waves on a
rocky shore or the howls of an ocean gale.

Combat
A water elemental prefers to fight in a large body of water where
it can disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up
behind its opponents.
Water Mastery (Ex): A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on
attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching
water. If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground,
the elemental takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
(These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
A water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that
crosses its path. An elemental can easily overturn small craft (5
feet of length per Hit Die of the elemental) and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD). Even large ships (20 feet long per
HD) can be slowed to half speed.

Drench (Ex): The elemental’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical
origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel
magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental’s HD).
Vortex (Su): The elemental can transform itself into a
whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and
remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In
vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along
the bottom at its swim speed.
The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the
top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the elemental’s size.
The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least
10 feet.
The elemental’s movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space
another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in
the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the elemental
moves into or through the creature’s space.
Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the vortex (see the
table below for details) and may be swept up by it. An affected
creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the vortex or take the indicated damage. It must also
succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held
suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking
damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Reflex
save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes
damage, but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves
against the vortex’s effects varies with the elemental’s size. The
save DC is Strength-based.
Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go
where the elemental carries them or to escape the
whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind
can otherwise act normally, but must make a
Concentration check (DC 10 + spell level) to cast a
spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4
penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack
rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time as will
fit inside the vortex’s volume.
The elemental can eject any carried creatures
whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the
vortex happens to be. A summoned elemental
always ejects trapped creatures before returning
to its home plane.
If the vortex’s base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to
half the vortex’s height. The cloud
obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet
away have concealment, while those
farther away have total concealment.
Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to
cast a spell.
An elemental in vortex form
cannot make slam attacks and does
not threaten the area around it,
Skills: A water elemental has a
+8 racial bonus on any Swim
check to perform some special
action or avoid a hazard. It can
always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even
if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action
while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

ELF
This humanoid, slender and slightly shorter than a human, has pale skin
and dark hair. Pointed ears grace the sides of its elongated head. It wears
armor with a natural, forest-themed design that appears organic instead
of worked and crafted.
Elves are aloof guardians of the forests, studying magic and swordplay for the duration of their long lives.
Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100
pounds. They live on fruits and grains, though they occasionally
hunt for fresh meat. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a
green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest.
They appreciate beautiful things, from elegant jewelry to attractive flowers to decorated clothing and tools.
Like dwarves, elves are craftmasters, although they work in
wood and metal rather than metal and stone. Elven items are
prized by other races, and many elven communities have become
prosperous by trading crafted goods with other peoples in and out
of the forests.
Elves speak Elven, and most also know Common and
Sylvan.
Most elves encountered outside their homes are warriors;
the information presented here is for one of 1st level.
COMBAT
Elves are cautious warriors and take time to analyze their
opponents and the location of the fight if at all possible,
maximizing their advantage by using ambushes,
snipers, and camouflage. They prefer to fire from
cover and retreat before they are found, repeating
this maneuver until all of their enemies are dead.
They prefer longbows, shortbows, rapiers, and
longswords. In melee, elves are
graceful and deadly, using complex maneuvers that are beautiful to
observe. Their wizards often use sleep
spells during combat because these
won’t affect other elves.
Elf Traits (Ex): Elves possess the following racial traits.
— +2 Dexterity, –2 Constitution.
—Medium size.
—An elf ’s base land speed is
30 feet.
—Immunity to sleep spells
and effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.
(Not reflected in the saving
throw modifiers given here.)
—Low-light vision.
—Weapon Proficiency: Elves
are automatically proficient
with the longsword, rapier,
longbow, composite longbow, shortbow,
and composite shortbow.
ELF
Elf 101
— +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf
who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is
entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.
—Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages:
Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Sylvan.
—Favored Class: Wizard.
The elf warrior presented here had the following ability scores
before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9,
Cha 8.
ELF SOCIETY
Elves believe that independence and freedom for the individual are more important than the rigid structures of civilization,
so they tend to live and travel in small bands. These bands
accept the loose authority of a noble, who in turn owes allegiance to an elven monarch (who rules his or her own band
directly).
Elves live in harmony with nature, building temporary camps
that blend into the trees—or are in the branches of the trees,
away from prying eyes. They frequently have animal guardians or
giant eagles watching their homes. An elven settlement contains
noncombatants (mostly children) equal to 20% of the fighting
population. Elf society is egalitarian, and males or females may be
found in almost any role.
Their long life span gives elves a patient perspective and
allows them to take pleasure in the enduring beauty of the natural world. They don’t see the point in short-term gains and
instead learn things that will provide joy for years to come, such
as stories, music, art, and dance. Treasures such as elven music
and crafts disguise the fact that elves are dedicated warriors
determined to check the spread of evil in the forests.
Elves eat little, and although they are omnivorous, they eat
more plants than meat. This is partly because of their affinity with
nature (they believe a harvested plant causes less disruption to
nature than a slain animal) and partly because their fondness for
roving requires food that is preserved more easily.
The chief elf deity is Corellon Larethian, who is the creator and
protector of the race.
SUBRACES
The above information describes the high elf, the most common
variety. There are five other major subraces of elf, in addition to
half-elves, who share enough elven characteristics to be
included here.
Half-Elf
Half-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken
for elves. They may be outcasts from their parents’ societies or welcomed into the elven or human community, depending on the
attitudes the two groups have for each other. Half-elves usually
inherit a good blend of their parents’ physical characteristics, so a
half-aquatic elf has greenish skin, a half-drow has dusky skin and
light hair, and so on.
Half-Elf Traits (Ex): Half-elves possess the following racial
traits.
—Medium size.
—A half-elf ’s base land speed is 30 feet.
—Immunity to sleep spells and similar magical effects, and a

Aquatic Elf
This humanoid is slender and
slightly shorter than a human.
It has pale, greenish silver skin
and emerald green hair. Its ears
are pointed, and its fingers and
toes are partially webbed.
Also called sea elves,
these creatures are waterbreathing cousins to
land-dwelling elves.
They cavort amid the
waves and the ocean
depths with allies such as
dolphins and whales.
Aquatic elves fight underwater
with tridents, spears, and nets.
Many aquatic elves revere Deep
Sashelas, an undersea god of knowledge and beauty.
Aquatic Elf Traits (Ex): These traits are in addition to the high
elf traits, except where noted.
— +2 Dexterity, –2 Intelligence. These adjustments replace the
high elf ’s ability score adjustments.
—An aquatic elf has the aquatic subtype.
—An aquatic elf has a swim speed of 40 feet.
—Gills: Aquatic elves can survive out of the water for 1 hour
per point of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules
on page 304 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).
—Superior Low-Light Vision: Aquatic elves can see four times
as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar
conditions of low illumination. This trait replaces the high elf ’s
low-light vision.
—Favored Class: Fighter. This trait replaces the high elf ’s

Drow
This humanoid is slender and shorter than a human. It has jet black skin
and white hair.
Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean offshoot.
White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost
any pale shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and thinner
than other sorts of elves, and their eyes are often a vivid red. Their
society is matriarchal and rigidly controlled by the priesthood.
The drow’s patron deity is the spider goddess Lolth. Female
drow favor the cleric class rather than
wizard and have access to two of
the following domains: Chaos,
Destruction, Evil, or Trickery.
Drow usually coat their arrows
with a potent venom.
Poison (Ex): An opponent
hit by a drow’s poisoned
weapon must succeed on a
DC 13 Fortitude save or fall
unconscious. After 1 minute,
the subject must succeed on
another DC 13 Fortitude save
or remain unconscious for 2d4
hours. A typical drow carries
1d4–1 doses of drow knockout poison. Drow typically
coat arrows and crossbow
bolts with this poison, but it
can also be applied to a melee
weapon. Note that drow have
no special ability to apply
poison without risking being
poisoned themselves. Since this
poison is not a magical effect,
drow and other elves are susceptible to it.
Drow Traits (Ex): These
traits are in addition to
the high elf traits, except
where noted.
— +2 Intelligence, +2
Charisma.
—Darkvision out to 120
feet. This trait replaces the high
elf ’s low-light vision.
—Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.
— +2 racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like
abilities.
—Spell-Like Abilities: Drow can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: dancing lights, darkness, faerie fire. Caster level equals
the drow’s class levels.
—Weapon Proficiency: A drow is automatically proficient with
the hand crossbow, the rapier, and the short sword. This trait
replaces the high elf ’s weapon proficiency.
—Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, Undercommon.
Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Draconic, Drow Sign Language,
Gnome, Goblin, Kuo-toan. This trait replaces the high elf ’s automatic and bonus languages.
—Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as
sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds drow for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the

Gray Elf
This humanoid is slender and nearly as tall as a human. It is paleskinned and dark-haired, with pointed ears.
Gray elves are the most noble and regal of all elves. Taller and
grander in physical appearance than others of their race, gray
elves have a reputation for being aloof and arrogant (even by elven
standards). They certainly are more reclusive than high elves, living
in isolated mountain citadels and allowing entry only to a select
few outsiders. They have either silver hair and amber eyes or pale
golden hair and violet eyes. They prefer clothing of white, silver,
yellow, or gold, with cloaks of deep blue or purple.
Gray Elf Traits (Ex): These traits are in addition to the high elf
traits.
— +2 Intelligence, –2 Strength.
Wild Elf
This humanoid is slender and shorter than a human. Its has dark brown
skin, pointed ears, and black hair.
Wild elves, also known as grugach, are barbaric and tribal.
Wild elves’ hair color ranges from black to light brown,
lightening to silvery white with age. They dress in simple
clothing of animal skins and basic plant weaves. Though other
elves consider them savages, they contend that they are the
true elves, for the rest have lost their primal elven essence in
needing to build. Nomadic and rugged, wild elves favor the
sorcerer class rather than wizard, although many are barbarians as well.

Wood Elf
Also called sylvan elves, members of this subrace live deep in primordial forests. Their hair color ranges from yellow to a coppery
red, and they are more muscular than other elves. Their clothing is
in dark shades of green and earth tones to better blend in with
their natural surroundings. Their homes are sometimes guarded
by giant owls or leopards.

This bizarre creature stands nearly as tall as
a human, but that’s where the similarity
ends. It has a baglike body that balances on a single, powerful leg that
ends in a prehensile foot. Its face is located in the center of its body, with
four eyes and a large mouth. Four long, multijointed arms extend from
the body, each ending in long, slender fingers.
Ethereal filchers are bizarre-looking creatures with a penchant
for snatching trinkets from passersby. Their ability to move
quickly between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane makes
them spectacular pickpockets.
ETHEREAL
FILCHER
Illus. by B. Despain
Ethereal filcher
104
Ethereal filchers dwell on the Material Plane, where they stuff
their lairs with all manner of refuse. They prefer secluded, inaccessible spots, such as the bottom of an abandoned well or mine
shaft, an alpine cave, or the basement of a ruined building.
Ethereal filchers do not speak.
COMBAT
An ethereal filcher prowls about, using its ethereal jaunt ability to
move about unseen (and often through solid objects). Upon locating a likely mark, it shifts to the Material Plane, attempting to
catch its victim unaware. The creature attempts to seize an item,
then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. It is not above
delivering a bite to distract its target. Once it secures a trinket, it
scurries back to its lair to admire its prize. When badly wounded,
a filcher escapes rather than continuing the fight.
Any number of simple ruses can blunt a filcher’s attack.
Quick-thinking individuals often can recover a stolen item
simply by snatching it back before the filcher can escape. (Use
the rules for making a disarm attempt, page 155 of the Player’s
Handbook.) Others keep a few cheap baubles available for the
local filcher to snatch. Filchers are known to have a nose for
magic, so items enspelled with Nystul’s magic aura or continual
flame spells often prove irresistible, especially if they are also
gaudy. Fortunately for its target, a filcher usually is satisfied
with a single prize.
Detect Magic (Su): Ethereal filchers can detect magic as the
spell (caster level 5th) at will.
Ethereal Jaunt (Su): An ethereal filcher can shift from the
Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action,
and shift back again as a free action. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane for 1 round before returning to the Material Plane. The
ability is otherwise identical with the ethereal jaunt spell (caster
level 15th).
Skills: Ethereal filchers have a +8 racial bonus on Sleight of
Hand checks, and a +4 racial bonus on
Listen and Spot checks.

This creature resembles a bipedal lizard with a sinuous tail. Its most
disturbing feature is its lack of a head. Instead it has a gaping maw
surrounded by three powerful mandibles; gleaming, jet-black teeth line
the inner mouth. Three small eyes ring the maw, interspersed with the
mandibles.
Ethereal marauders are aggressive predators that can move
quickly from the Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane.
Ethereal marauders live and hunt on the Ethereal Plane. Their
ecology and habits are obscure at best—few have observed them
in their natural habitat for any length of time, and their appearances on the Material Plane are limited to those occasions when
they are attacking prey. They are assumed to have no society or culture in the traditional sense, being motivated solely by the need
for sustenance and survival.
Ethereal marauders’ coloration ranges from bright blue to deep
violet. An ethereal marauder stands about 4 feet tall, but its overall
length is about 7 feet. It weighs about 200 pounds.
Ethereal marauders speak no
known languages. Survivors of their
attacks on the Material Plane claim
that they emit an eerie, high whine that
varies in pitch depending on the creature’s
speed and health.
COMBAT
Once a marauder locates prey, it shifts to the
Material Plane to attack, attempting to catch its
victim flat-footed. The creature bites its victim,
then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. When
badly hurt or wounded, a marauder escapes to its home
plane rather than continuing the fight.
Ethereal Jaunt (Su): An ethereal marauder can shift
from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free
action, and shift back again as a move action. The
ability is otherwise identical with the ethereal jaunt
spell (caster level 15th).
Skills: Ethereal marauders have a +2
racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, and
Spot checks.

This revolting creature resembles a cross between a gangly human and a
bloated spider. It has long, slender arms and legs protruding from a rounded,
fleshy body. It has a spider’s head with a pair of bulbous black eyes.
Although not very intelligent, ettercaps are cunning predators.
Like the monstrous spiders in whose company they are often
found, they are skilled hunters and trappers.
Lurking in dark shadows, ettercaps are solitary creatures that
exist only to eat and breed. They often make their homes near welltraveled paths or game trails, where food is plentiful. They savor the
taste of still-living flesh, often consuming incapacitated prey before
it dies.
Ettercaps are very fond of spiders and often keep them as others
keep bees. Some ettercaps have a number of monstrous spiders as
pets, which are as loyal to it as a dog is to a human master.
An ettercap is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.
Ettercaps speak Common.
COMBAT
Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps often
ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap
does engage its enemies, it attacks with its keen-edged claws
and venomous bite. It usually will not come within melee reach
of any foe that is still able to move.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial damage 1d6 Dex,
secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution based
and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Web (Ex): An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This
is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Medium size. The web anchors the target in place,
allowing no movement.
An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist
check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check
DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC
includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0,
and takes double damage from fire.
Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to
60 feet square. They usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching
creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web, or
they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a
+5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or
grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section has 6 hit
points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.
An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb
speed and can determine the exact location of any creature
touching the web.
Skills: Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Hide, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on
Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,
even if rushed or threatened.

This hulking giant has
two heads. Each head
has a porcine face with a
shovel jaw and protruding
lower canines like a boar’s tusks. The rest
of its teeth are large and rotten. Its
stringy hair is filthy, just like the
rest of the creature.
Ettins, or two-headed giants, are
vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk the night. Their
two heads make them exceptionally sharp-eyed and alert. They
are excellent guardians and scouts.
An ettin never bathes if it can help it, which usually leaves it
so grimy and dirty its skin resembles thick, gray hide (ettins
that don’t smell bad are rare indeed). Adult ettins are about 13
feet tall and weigh 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years.
Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Orc,
Goblin, and Giant. Creatures that can speak any of these languages must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an ettin. Check once for each bit of information: If the
other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, and for
someone who speaks all three, the DC is 5. Ettins talk among
themselves without difficulty, despite their low Intelligence, and
a lone ettin often whiles away the hours chatting with itself.
COMBAT
Though ettins aren’t very intelligent, they are cunning fighters.
They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a
straight fight, but once the battle has started, an ettin usually
fights furiously until all enemies are dead.
Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex): An ettin fights with a
morningstar or javelin in each hand. Because each of its two heads
controls an arm, the ettin does not take a penalty on attack or
damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.
Skills: An ettin’s two heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Listen,
Spot, and Search checks.
ETTIN SOCIETY
Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote, rocky areas. They dwell
in dark, underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal.
They tolerate other creatures, such as orcs, if these can be
useful in some way. Otherwise, ettins tend to be violently
isolationist, crushing trespassers without question.
Ettins are generally solitary, and mated pairs stay
together for only a few months after a child is born.
Young ettins mature quickly. Within eight to ten
months after birth, they are self-sufficient
enough to go off on their own.
On rare occasions, a particularly strong
ettin may gather a small group, or gang, of
ettins. This gang stays together only as long
as the leader is undefeated. Any major defeat
shatters the leader’s hold over the others,
and they go their separate ways.
Ettins place little value on wealth but
are smart enough to understand its value
to others. They collect treasure only
because it can buy them the services of
goblins or orcs. These lesser creatures
sometimes build traps around ettins’
lairs, or help them fight off powerful
opponents.
FIENDISH
CREATURE
Fiendish creatures dwell on the
lower planes, the realms of evil,
although they resemble beings found on
the Material Plane. They are more fearsome
in appearance than their earthly counterparts.
Fiendish creatures are often mistaken for halffiends, more powerful creatures that are created when
a fiend mates with a noncelestial creature, or
through some foul infernal breeding project.

CREATING A FIENDISH CREATURE
“Fiendish” is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or
vermin of nongood alignment (referred to
hereafter as the base creature).
A fiendish creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted
here. Do not recalculate the creature’s Hit
Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its
type changes.
Size and Type: Animals or vermin with this
template become magical beasts, but otherwise
the creature type is unchanged. Size is
unchanged. Fiendish creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the extraplanar subtype.
Special Attacks: A fiendish creature retains all the special attacks of
the base creature and also gains the
following special attack.
Smite Good (Su): Once per day
the creature can make a normal
melee attack to deal extra
damage equal to its HD total
(maximum of +20) against a
good foe.
Special Qualities: A
fiendish creature retains
all the special qualities
of the base creature and
also gains the following.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Damage reduction (see the table below).
—Resistance to cold and fire (see the
table below).
—Spell resistance equal to the creature’s HD
+ 5 (maximum 25).
If the base creature already has one or more of these special
qualities, use the better value.
If a fiendish creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Abilities: Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at
least 3.
Environment: Any evil-aligned plane.
Challenge Rating: HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as

FORMIAN
Formians hail from the plane of Mechanus. They seek to colonize all that they see and incorporate all living things into their
hive as workers.
Expansionist in the extreme, formians are dedicated to
spreading their colonies until they have taken over everything
and their order is unquestioned. To further this end, they attack
all other creatures, usually to put them to work building and
expanding cities. Formians maintain these “conscripted” workers as well as those mentally dominated by the power of their
taskmasters.
A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All
formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.
COMBAT
Formians are generally aggressive, seeking
to subdue all they
encounter. If they perceive even the slightest
threat to their hive-city
or to their queen,
they attack immediately and fight to the
death. Any formian also attacks
immediately if ordered to do so
by a superior.
Hive Mind (Ex): All formians within 50 miles of
their queen are in constant communication. If
one is aware of a particular
danger, they all are. If one
in a group is not flatfooted, none of them
are. No formian in
a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.
FORMIAN SOCIETY
Formians build fabulous hive-cities in which hundreds of the creatures dwell. They are born into their station, with no ability to
progress. Workers obey orders given by warriors, myrmarchs, or the
queen. Warriors carry out the will of their myrmarch commanders
or the queen. Myrmarchs take orders only from the queen herself,
although they have different ranks depending on services rendered.
These are not positions of power but of prestige. The most prestigious of the myrmarchs guard the queen. Taskmasters are equal in
rank to warriors but seldom interact with other formians.
WORKER
This creature is about the size of a jackal or bulldog. It looks like an ant,
but holds its head and thorax upright. It has humanlike shoulders and
arms ending in rudimentary hands with blunt claws.
Workers are the lowest-ranking and most common formians. They
exist only to serve, performing all the necessary, lowly tasks that
the hive needs done.
While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts
(such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind,
however, they can communicate just fine—although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp.

A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the
front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for
manual labor.
Combat
Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their
mandibled bite.
A formian worker’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Cure Serious Wounds (Sp): Eight workers together can heal a
creature’s wounds as though using the cure serious wounds spell
(caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all eight workers.
Make Whole (Sp): Three workers together can repair an object as
though using the make whole spell (caster level 7th). This is a fullround action for all three workers.
WARRIOR
This creature is about the size of a pony. It looks like an ant, but holds its
head and thorax upright. Its mouth features powerful-looking mandibles.
The creature has humanlike shoulders and arms ending in powerful
hands with sharp claws. Its abdomen bears a stinger.
Formian warriors exist only to fight.
Warriors rank only slightly above workers. They communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and make
reports to their commanders. They cannot speak otherwise.
A warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high
at the front. It weighs about 180 pounds.
Combat
Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at once. Through the hive mind, they attack with
coordinated and extremely efficient tactics.
A formian warrior’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary
damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.
TASKMASTER
This creature is about the size of a pony. It looks like an ant, but holds
its head and thorax upright. It does not appear to have a mouth. The

with sharp claws. Its abdomen bears a stinger.

Taskmasters resemble warriors with no mandibles—no apparent
mouth at all, in fact. These formians communicate only telepathically and derive sustenance from the mental energies of those
they dominate.
A taskmaster’s duty is to gather and control nonformians for integration into the hive. Put simply, taskmasters enslave other creatures. They do not enjoy controlling others but believe it is the
only efficient way to spread the hive to all places, a desirable end
for all rational creatures. If a taskmaster can manage to “conscript”
a laborer without using its dominate monster ability, it will do so.
Those few souls who have escaped refer to formian hivecities as “work pits.” While formians are not cruel, they are still
emotionless—and pitiless.
A taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior.
Combat
Taskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at
all possible. If necessary, though, they can defend themselves with
claws and a poison sting.
A formian taskmaster’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Dominate Monster (Su): A taskmaster can use a dominate
monster ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17
negates), although the subject may be of any kind and may be up
to Large size. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected
by the same taskmaster’s dominate monster ability for 24 hours. A
single taskmaster can dominate up to four subjects at a time. The
save DC is Charisma-based.
Dominated Creature (Ex): A taskmaster is never encountered
alone. One dominated nonformian creature always accompanies
it (choose or determine randomly any creature of CR 4).
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary
damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.
MYRMARCH
This creature is about the size of a light horse. It looks like an ant, but
holds its head and thorax upright. Its mouth features powerful-looking
mandibles, and it wears an elaborate bronze helmet. The creature has
humanlike shoulders and arms ending in humanlike hands. Its abdomen
bears a stinger.
Myrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those
beneath them, these creatures are individuals, with goals, desires,
and creative thought. Very rarely do these thoughts conflict with
the wishes of the queen, though—most myrmarchs are still very
loyal to her.
Myrmarchs are commanders in formian armies and leaders in
formian communities. They are the hands of the queen, carrying
out her direct orders and making sure everything goes as she
desires. Myrmarchs also have a secondary role: stamping out chaos
wherever and whenever they can. Those who foment disorder,
and particularly creatures that revere or exemplify it (such as
slaadi), are the hated foes of myrmarchs.
A myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet
high at the front. It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its claws are
capable of fine manipulation, like human hands. Each myrmarch
wears a bronze helm to signify its position (the more elaborate the
helm, the more prestigious the position).
Myrmarchs speak Formian and Common.

Combat
Myrmarchs’ claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose. Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks,
coated with poison from their own stingers.
They fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such
are present) and commanding them through the hive mind. If
chaotic creatures are present, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them.
A formian myrmarch’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

QUEEN
This creature looks like a gigantic, bloated ant. Its legs seem atrophied and
nonfunctional.
The formian queen sits at the center of the hive-city, her bloated
form never moving from the royal chamber. She is served and
guarded by the most loyal myrmarchs.
The formian queen cannot move. With her telepathic abilities, though, she can send instructions to
and get reports from any formian within her range.
She is about 10 feet long, perhaps 4 feet high, and
weighs about 3,500 pounds.
The queen speaks Formian and Common,
although she can communicate with any creature
telepathically.
Combat
The queen does not fight. She
has no ability to move. If necessary, a team of workers
and myrmarchs (or dominated slaves) haul her
enormous bulk to where
she needs to go. This sort
of occurrence is very rare,
however, and most of the
time the queen remains
within her well-defended
chambers.
Despite her utter lack
of physical activity, the
queen can cast spells and
use spell-like abilities to
great effect in her own defense as well as the defense of
the hive-city.
Spells: The queen casts
arcane spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.

This long, blue-white creature has
huge mandibles and a strange
nodule atop its head from which it
generates a trilling sound.
Terror of the frozen
lands, the frost worm
spends most of its life
burrowing through
the ice, snow, and even
the frozen earth. It surfaces only to attack its
prey. Frost worms eat yaks,
polar bears, walruses, seals,
moose, and mammoths.
Sages cannot agree whether this
horrible monster is related to the
purple worm or to the remorhaz. Perhaps the
answer is neither. It is true that frost worms hate
remorhazes and attack them on sight in a colossal
battle that might very well lay waste to a large area.
Remorhazes are frequently the victors in such battles.
A frost worn cannot burrow through stone, but can manage
ice and frozen earth. When moving through such hard materials it
leaves behind a usable tunnel about 5 feet in diameter.
FROST WORM
Frost worm
Frost worms lay eggs that to the untrained observer appear to be
simply oval-shaped ice formations. Hatchling frost worms must
immediately fend for themselves, growing to maturity in three to
five years. Tribesfolk of the cold wastes can sometimes train young
frost worms to help protect the community and even to be ridden
using magic, cold-resistant saddles.
A frost worm is about 40 feet long, 5 feet in diameter, and
weighs about 8,000 pounds.
COMBAT
Frost worms lurk under the snow, waiting for prey to come near.
They begin an attack with a trill and then set upon helpless prey
with their bite.
Trill (Su): A frost worm can emit a noise that forces its
prey to stand motionless. This sonic mind-affecting compulsion affects all creatures other than frost worms within
a 100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC 17
Will save or be stunned for as long as the worm trills and for 1d4
rounds thereafter, even if they are attacked. However, if
attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action), a victim is
allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted
or broken the effect, it cannot be affected again by that
same frost worm’s trill for 24 hours. The effect’s caster
level is 14th. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Cold (Ex): A frost worm’s body generates intense
cold, causing opponents to take an extra 1d8 points of
cold damage every time the creature succeeds on a bite
attack. Creatures attacking a frost worm unarmed or with
natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one
of their attacks hits.
Breath Weapon (Su): 30-foot cone, once per hour, damage
15d6 cold, Reflex DC 22 half. Opponents held motionless by the
frost worm’s trill get no saving throw. The save DC is Constitutionbased.
Death Throes (Ex): When killed, a frost worm turns to ice and
shatters in an explosion that deals 12d6 points of cold damage and
8d6 points of piercing damage to everything within 100 feet
(Reflex half DC 22). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Skills: *A frost worm, due to its coloration and its affinity for burying itself in the snow, has a +10 racial bonus on Hide
checks in its native environment.
FUNGUS
Unlike ordinary kinds of fungus, which are harmless to other
living creatures, the two specimens described here—the shrieker
and the violet fungus—can be dangerous to unwary adventurers.
A fungus lacks chlorophyll, a true stem, roots, or leaves. Incapable of photosynthesis, it exists as a parasite, breaking
down organic matter slowly. While both of the
creatures described here occur individually, shriekers and violet fungi often
coexist in the same environment.

COMBAT
Shriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill
prey. When the shriekers’ hellish racket attracts a curious creature,
the violet fungus tries to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a
successful hunt.
SHRIEKER
This creature looks like a human-sized mushroom.
A shrieker is a stationary fungus that emits a loud noise to attract
prey or when disturbed. Shriekers live in dark, subterranean
places, often in the company of violet fungi, whose poison
they are immune to.
Shriekers come in of shades of purple.
Combat
A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures
prey to its vicinity by emitting a loud noise.
Shriek (Ex): Movement or a light source
within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus
to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3
rounds. The sound attracts nearby creatures
that are disposed to investigate it. Some
creatures that live near shriekers come to
learn that the fungus’s noise means there is
food nearby.
VIOLET FUNGUS
This human-sized mushroom has four
tendrillike tentacles and a mass of small,
rootlike feelers at its base that enable it to
move slowly.
Violet fungi resemble shriekers and
are often found growing among them.
A violet fungi’s coloration ranges
from purple overall to dull gray or
violet covered with purple spots.
Combat
A violet fungus flails about with its
tentacles at living creatures that come
within its reach.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14,
initial and secondary damage 1d4 Str and
1d4 Con. The save DC is Constitutionbased.

This creature looks like a grotesque, winged humanoid with a horned head
and a stony hide.
A gargoyle is a vicious flying predator that enjoys torturing creatures weaker than itself.
Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they
can perch indefinitely without moving and use this disguise to surprise their foes. They require no food, water,
or air, but often eat their fallen foes out of fondness
for inflicting pain. When not enjoying their
favorite pastime, a wing of gargoyles can be found
waiting silently for prey or bragging among
themselves.
Gargoyles speak Common and Terran.
COMBAT
Gargoyles either remain still, then suddenly attack, or dive onto
their prey.
A gargoyle’s natural
weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.
Freeze (Ex): A gargoyle can
hold itself so still it appears to be
a statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to
notice the gargoyle is really
alive.
Skills: Gargoyles have a +2
racial bonus on Hide, Listen,
and Spot checks. *The
Hide bonus increases by
+8 when a gargoyle is concealed against a background of stone.
KAPOACINTH
These cousins of the gargoyle
have the aquatic subtype. They have a
base land speed of 40 feet and a swim speed of
60 feet (no fly speed) and are found only in
aquatic environments.
GARGOYLES AS CHARACTERS
Gargoyles make excellent scouts, spies, and fighters. Able to soar
aloft at a moment’s notice, they can ravage their landbound foes
and take aloft to the air.
Gargoyle characters possess the following racial traits.
— +4 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +8 Constitution, –4 Intelligence,
–4 Charisma.
—Medium size.
—A gargoyle’s base land speed is 40 feet. It also has a fly speed
of 60 feet (average).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Racial Hit Dice: A gargoyle begins with four levels of monstrous humanoid, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus

GENIE
Genies are humanlike beings who dwell on the elemental
planes. They are famous for their strength, guile, and skill with
illusion magic.
Genies sometimes use the Material Plane as a neutral ground
for meeting (or fighting) others of their kind or collecting goods
not readily available on their home planes.
COMBAT
Genies prefer to outmaneuver and outthink their foes. They are
not too proud to flee if it means they’ll live to fight another day. If
trapped, they bargain, offering treasure or favors in return for
their lives and freedom.
Plane Shift (Sp): A genie can enter any of the elemental planes,
the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the
genie and up to eight other creatures, provided they all link
hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the
same name (caster level 13th).

The being looks like a well-formed human with a dark complexion, but
nearly twice as tall.
The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Elemental Plane of
Air. They live on floating islands of earth and rock, anywhere from
3,000 feet to several miles across, crammed with buildings, courtyards, gardens, fountains, and sculptures. Each island is ruled by a
local sheik.
The structure of djinn society is based on rule by a caliph served
by various nobles and officials (viziers, beys, amirs, sheiks, sharifs,
and maliks). A caliph rules all djinn estates within two days’ travel
and is advised by six viziers who help maintain the balance of
the landholds.
If a large force attacks a landhold, a messenger (usually the
youngest djinni) is sent to the next landhold, which sends aid and
dispatches two more messengers to warn the next landholds, thus
alerting the entire nation.
A djinni is about 10-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.
Djinn speak Auran, Celestial, Common, and Ignan.
Combat
Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical
powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in
combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass
those who follow.
Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on
attack and damage rolls against a djinni.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—invisibility (self only); 1/day—
create food and water, create wine (as create water, but wine instead),
major creation (created vegetable matter is permanent), persistent
image (DC 17), wind walk. Once per day, a djinni can assume gaseous
form (as the spell) for up to 1 hour. Caster level 20th. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.
Whirlwind (Su): A djinni can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 7
rounds. In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface
at its fly speed.
The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the
top and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni controls the exact height, but
it must be at least 10 feet.
A djinni’s movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke
attacks of opportunity, even if the djinni enters the space another
creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the djinni moves
into or through the creature’s space.
Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni
might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted
into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex
save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6
points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex
save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful
winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A
creature with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex save each
round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but
can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based
and includes a +3 racial adjustment.
Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go
where the djinni carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but
must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a
spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. The djinni can have only as
many trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the
whirlwind’s volume.
The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes,
depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be.
If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling
cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni and has a
diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures
all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet

A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and
does not threaten the area around it.
Noble Djinn
Some djinn (1% of the total population) are noble. A noble djinni
can grant three wishes to any being (nongenies only) who captures
it. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the
third wish, are free of their servitude. Noble djinn
are as strong as efreet (see below), with

This being looks like a mighty giant with brick-red skin, fiery eyes, small
horns, and jutting tusks.
The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Elemental Plane of
Fire. They are said to be made of basalt, bronze, and congealed
flames.
Efreet are infamous for their hatred of servitude, desire for revenge, cruel nature, and ability to beguile and mislead. Their primary home is the fabled City of Brass, but there are many efreet
outposts throughout the Elemental Plane of Fire, military stations for watching or harassing others on the
plane. Efreet are enemies of the
djinn and attack them whenever
they meet.
The efreet are ruled by a grand
sultan who makes his home in
the City of Brass. He is advised by
a variety of beys, amirs, and
maliks concerning actions on the plane,
and by six great
pashas who
deal with
e f r e e t
business
on the Material Plane.
The City of
Brass is a huge
citadel that is
home to the majority
of efreet. It hovers in the
hot regions of the plane
and is bordered by seas
and lakes of glowing
magma. The city
sits upon a hemisphere of glowing
brass some 40
miles in diameter. From the
upper towers
rise the minarets of the
great bastion of
the sultan’s
palace, which
is said to hold
vast riches.
The city’s
population far
outnumbers
that of any of
the great cities of the
Material Plane.
An efreeti stands about 12 feet
tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds.
Efreet speak Auran, Common, Ignan, and Infernal.
Combat
Efreet love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do so
for enjoyment as well as a battle tactic.
Change Size (Sp): Twice per day, an efreeti can magically change
a creature’s size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce
person spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except
that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save
GHOST
116
negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the
equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Heat (Ex): An efreeti’s red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra
fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold when grappling.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—detect magic, produce flame,
pyrotechnics (DC 14), scorching ray (1 ray only); 3/day—invisibility,
wall of fire (DC 16); 1/day—grant up to three wishes (to nongenies
only), gaseous form, permanent image (DC 18), polymorph (self only).

This creature looks like a tall human. It stands proudly, with a regal bearing that is almost palpable.
The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are
formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of
their time on the Material Plane. They favor forlorn deserts and
hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety.
Jann society is very open, treating males and females as equals.
Each tribe is ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers. Exceptionally
powerful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in times of need
they gather and command large forces of jann (and sometimes
allied humans).
Many jann bands are nomadic, traveling with herds of camels,
goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis. These itinerant jann are often
mistaken for humans—until they are attacked. The territory of a
jann tribe can extend for hundreds of miles.
Jann speak Common, one elemental language (Aquan, Auran,
Ignan, or Terran) and one alignment language (Abyssal, Celestial,
or Infernal).
Combat
Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly
to insult or injury. If they meet a foe they cannot defeat in a standup fight, they use flight and invisibility to regroup and maneuver to
a more advantageous position.
Change Size (Sp): Twice per day, a janni can magically change a
creature’s size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person
spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the
ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a
2nd-level spell.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—invisibility (self only), speak with
animals. Caster level 12th. Once per day a janni can create food and
water (caster level 7th) and can use ethereal jaunt (caster level 12th)
for 1 hour. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Elemental Endurance (Ex): Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to
return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni
to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

GHOST
Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one
reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves.
Some ghosts go about their business with little or no interest in
the living. Others, however, are malevolent spirits who loathe all
life and seek to destroy it whenever possible. Although ghosts can
often be driven off or destroyed, they return again and again until
they deal with the reason for their existence.
A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some
cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered. Some ghosts look
angelic and sweet, while others are twisted and horrible things,
showing clearly the agony of the undead. There is often—but not
always—a correlation between a ghost’s appearance and its alignment. Assumptions are dangerous.
A ghost’s behavior usually matches its life. The spirit of a miserly
person, for example, might continue to hoard wealth even though
it has no use for such treasures. Similarly, a ghost is generally tied
to the place where it died. If the aforementioned miser had died in
a robbery, the ghost might remain in the counting house, tormenting the new owner and all who do business there. This is not a hard
and fast rule, though—many ghosts wander freely.

CREATING A GHOST
“Ghost” is an acquired template that can be added to any aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous
humanoid, or plant. The creature (referred to hereafter as the base
creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6.
A ghost uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities
except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not
recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It
gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged.
Hit Dice: All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.
Speed: Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability.
Armor Class: Natural armor is the same as the base creature’s
but applies only to ethereal encounters. When the ghost
manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus is +0, but it
gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or
+1, whichever is higher.
Attack: A ghost retains all the attacks
of the base creature, although those relying
on physical contact do
not affect creatures that
are not ethereal.
Full Attack: A ghost
retains all the attacks of
the base creature, although those relying on
physical contact do not
affect creatures that are
not ethereal.
Damage: Against ethereal creatures, a ghost uses
the base creature’s damage
values. Against nonethereal creatures,
the ghost usually cannot
deal physical damage at all
but can use its special
attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below).
Special Attacks: A
ghost retains all the special attacks of the base
creature, although
those relying on
physical contact do
not affect nonethereal creatures. The
ghost also gains a
manifestation ability plus
one to three other special
attacks as described below. The save DC
against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost’s HD + ghost’s
Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.
Corrupting Gaze (Su): A ghost can blast living beings with a
glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost’s
gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of
damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.
Corrupting Touch (Su): A ghost that hits a living target with its
incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage
rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.
Draining Touch (Su): A ghost that hits a living target with its
incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability
score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals
GHOUL
118
5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its
Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.
Frightful Moan (Su): A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a
sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same
ghost’s moan for 24 hours.
Horrific Appearance (Su): Any living creature within 60 feet
that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be
affected by the same ghost’s horrific appearance for 24 hours.
Malevolence (Su): Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge
its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is
similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost’s Hit
Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a
receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and
it must try move into the target’s space; moving into the target’s
space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful
Will save (DC 15 + ghost’s Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost’s malevolence for 24
hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target’s space. If the save
fails, the ghost vanishes into the target’s body.
Manifestation (Su): Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells
on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot
affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a
ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and
becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore
any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can
pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass
through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently.
A manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a
ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it
not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents
on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost’s
incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but
not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.
When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane,
but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets
and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the
spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost’s touch spells don’t work
on nonethereal targets.
A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the
Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either
of these planes.
Telekinesis (Su): A ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action
(caster level 12th or equal to the ghost’s HD, whichever is higher).
When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before
using it again.
Special Qualities: A ghost has all the special qualities of the
base creature as well as those described below.
Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, it’s difficult to destroy a
ghost through simple combat: The “destroyed” spirit will often
restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be
destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check
(1d20 + ghost’s HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get
rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace.
The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good
deal of research.
Turn Resistance (Ex): A ghost has +4 turn resistance.
Abilities: Same as the base creature, except that the ghost has
no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +4.
Skills: Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search,
and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.
Environment: Any, often as base creature.
Organization: Solitary, gang (2–4), or mob (7–12).
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.
Treasure: None.
Alignment: Any.
Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +5.
Ghostly Equipment
When a ghost forms, all its equipment and carried items usually
become ethereal along with it. In addition, the ghost retains 2d4
items that it particularly valued in life (provided they are not in
another creature’s possession). The equipment works normally on
the Ethereal Plane but passes harmlessly through material objects
or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement,
however, can harm material creatures when the ghost manifests,
but any such attack has a 50% chance to fail unless the weapon is
a ghost touch weapon (just as magic weapons can fail to harm the
ghost).
The original material items remain behind, just as the ghost’s
physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the
ethereal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who
stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place.
GHOUL
This foul creature appears more or less humanoid, but has mottled,
decaying flesh drawn tight across clearly visible bones. It is mostly hairless and has a carnivore’s sharp teeth. Its eyes burn like hot coals in their
sunken sockets.
Ghouls haunt graveyards, battlefields, and other places rich with
the carrion they hunger for. These terrible creatures lurk wherever
the stench of death hangs heavy, ready to devour the unwary.
Ghouls are said to be created upon the death of a living man or
woman who savored the taste of the flesh of people. This assertion
may or may not be true, but it does explain the disgusting behavior
of these anthropophagous undead. Some believe that anyone of
exceptional debauchery and wickedness runs the risk of becoming
a ghoul. The transformation from living beings into fell things of
the night has warped their minds, making them cunning and feral.
Ghouls speak the languages they spoke in life (usually
Common).
COMBAT
Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever possible. They strike
from behind tombstones and burst from shallow graves.
Ghoul Fever (Su): Disease—bite, Fortitude DC 12, incubation
period 1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul
at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this
way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under
the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the
living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid
of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast, not a ghoul.
Paralysis (Ex): Those hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1
rounds. Elves have immunity to this paralysis. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
LACEDON
These cousins of the ghoul have the aquatic subtype. They lurk
near hidden reefs or other places where ships are likely to meet
their end. They have a base land speed of 30 feet and a swim
speed of 30 feet and are found only in aquatic environments.
GHAST
Although these creatures look just like their lesser kin, they are far
more deadly and cunning.
Combat
Ghoul Fever (Su): Disease—bite, Fortitude DC 15, incubation period 1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Paralysis (Ex): Those hit by a ghast’s bite or claw attack must
succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1
rounds. Even elves can be affected by this paralysis. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Stench (Ex): The stink of death and corruption
surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures
within 10 feet must
succeed on a DC 15
Fortitude save or
be sickened for
1d6+4 minutes. A
creature that successfully saves
cannot be affected again by the same ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A
delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected,
and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on
their saving throws. The save DC is Charisma-based.
GIANT
Giants combine great size with great strength, giving them an unparalleled ability to wreak destruction upon anyone or anything
unfortunate enough to get in their way.
Giants have a reputation for crudeness and stupidity that is not
undeserved, especially among the evil varieties. Most rely on their
tremendous strength to solve problems, reasoning that any difficulty that won’t succumb to brute force isn’t worth worrying about. Giants usually subsist by hunting and
raiding, taking what they like from creatures weaker
than themselves.
All giants speak Giant. Those with Intelligence
scores of 10 or higher also speak Common.
COMBAT
Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive
two-handed weapons and wield them with impressive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up a
foe with ranged attacks first, if they can. A giant’s
favorite ranged weapon is a big rock.
Rock Throwing (Ex): Adult giants are accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial
bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A
giant of at least Large size can hurl rocks weighing
40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up to five
range increments. The size of the range increment
varies with the giant’s variety. A Huge giant can
hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium objects).
Rock Catching (Ex): A giant of at least
Large size can catch Small, Medium, or Large
rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).
Once per round, a giant that would
normally be hit by a rock can

Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the
projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready for and aware of
the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.
GIANT SOCIETY
Solitary giants are often young adults striking out on their own.
Gangs are usually made up of young adults who hunt or raid (or
both) together. Giant bands are usually large or extended families.
Sometimes a band contains unrelated young adults that the band
has taken in as mates, servants, or guards.
Giant tribes are similar to bands but have more members, plus
contingents of guard creatures and nongiant servants. Hunting
and raiding parties include guard creatures and may be made up of
giants from different tribes working together.
About a third of the giants in a band or tribe are giant children,
who can be formidable creatures in their own right. When a
group of giants includes children, roll d% for each child to determine maturity: 01–25 infant (no combat ability); 26–50 juvenile (two sizes smaller than an adult, 8 fewer HD, –8 Strength, –8
Constitution, and 1 rank in each skill that an adult has); and
51–100 adolescent (one size smaller than an adult, 4 fewer HD,
–4 Strength, –4 Constitution, and 2, 3, or 4 ranks in each skill that
an adult has). Giant children can throw rocks if they meet the
minimum size requirement (see above). Except when otherwise
noted, giant children are identical with adults of their variety.

This giant has a muscular humanoid build and handsome, welldefined features. Its skin is milky white tinged with blue, and it has
silvery white hair.
Cloud giants consider themselves above all others, except storm
giants, whom they regard as equals. They are creative, appreciate
fine things, and are master strategists in battle.
Cloud giants’ skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky
blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000
pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can
live to be 400 years old.
Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes
and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They
also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments
(the harp is a favorite).
Unlike most other giant varieties, cloud giants leave their treasure in their lairs. A could giant’s bag contains food, 1d4+1 throwing rocks, 3d4 mundane items, a modest amount of cash (no more

GIANTS’ BAGS
Most giants carry big leather shoulder sacks to hold their personal possessions. It is a common myth that giants’ bags are stuffed with gold
(always at least 1,000 gp, by some accounts). In truth, they usually hold
a few battered and smelly personal items, a supply of throwing rocks,
some less than fresh rations, and a few trinkets. However, giants sometimes carry magic treasures that are too small for them to use, and
many adventurers find looting a giant’s bag to be worthwhile. The table
below shows typical mundane items; roll d% or choose from the list.
The number of items in a bag varies according to the giant variety (see

than 10d10 coins), and a musical instrument. A cloud giant’s possessions are usually well made and maintained.
Combat
Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their
opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging
them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound
them with spells.
Rock Throwing (Ex): The range increment is 140 feet for a
cloud giant’s thrown rocks.
Oversized Weapon (Ex): A cloud giant wields a great, twohanded morningstar (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—levitate (self plus 2,000 pounds),
obscuring mist; 1/day—fog cloud. Caster level 15th.
Cloud Giant Society
The majority of cloud giants dwell on cloud-shrouded mountain peaks, making their lairs in crude castles. They live in
small groups but know the location of 1d8 other groups and
come together with some of these other tribes for celebrations,
battles, or trade.
Good-aligned cloud giants trade with humanoid communities for food, wine, jewelry, and cloth. Some establish such good
relations that they come to a community’s aid if it is endangered. Evil-aligned cloud giants raid communities to get what
they want.
Legends tell of rare cloud giants that build castles on magical
cloud islands isolated even from other cloud giants.
Cloud islands are reputed to be fantastic places with giant-sized
gardens of fruit trees.
Cloud Giant Characters
Most cloud giant groups include a sorcerer or a cleric.
Good-aligned clerics have access to two of the following
domains: Good, Healing, Strength, or Sun. Evil-aligned
clerics have access to two of the following domains:
Death, Evil, or Trickery.

This giant resembles a mammoth dwarf with coal-black skin, flaming red
hair, and a prognathous jaw that reveals dirty ivory teeth.
Fire giants are brutal, ruthless, and militaristic.
Some fire giants have bright orange hair.. An adult male is 12
feet tall, has a chest that measures 9 feet
around, and weighs about 7,000 pounds.
Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Fire
giants can live to be 350 years old.
Fire giants wear sturdy cloth or leather garments
colored red, orange, yellow, or black. Warriors wear helmets and half-plate armor of blackened steel.
A typical fire giant’s bag contains 1d4+1 throwing rocks,
3d4 mundane items, a tinderbox, and the giant’s personal
wealth. Everything a fire giant owns is battered, dirty,

fire, geyser, or lava pools, so that they deal
extra fire damage. They favor magic flaming swords in melee (when they can get
them). They are also fond of grabbing
smaller opponents and tossing them
somewhere very hot.
Rock Throwing (Ex): The range
increment is 120 feet for a fire
giant’s thrown rocks.
Fire Giant Society
Fire giants dwell only in hot
places. They prefer volcanic
regions or areas with hot springs.
They live in well-organized military groups, occupying large castles or caverns. Tribal leaders
refer to themselves as “king” or
“queen.” Fire giants usually engage in ongoing military campaigns to subjugate the areas
around them and often receive
tribute from creatures living
nearby.
Fire giants like to take captives. For each ten adult giants
in a tribe, there is a 30% chance

that the lair has 1d2 captives. These prisoners can be any sort of
creature.
Fire Giant Characters
Most groups of fire giants include clerics. A fire giant cleric has
access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Trickery, or War
(most choose Trickery or War, some choose both).
FROST GIANT
This giant looks like a beefy, muscular human with snow-white skin and
light blue hair and eyes.
Frost giants are justifiably feared as brutal and wantonly destructive raiders.
A frost giant’s hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes
usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts,
along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors add chain
shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers.
An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800
pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise
identical with males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.
A frost giant’s bag usually contains 1d4+1 throwing rocks, 3d4
mundane items, and the giant’s personal wealth. Everything in a
frost giant’s bag is old, worn, dirty, and smelly, making the identification of any valuable items difficult.
Combat
Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks
until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then
wading in with their enormous battleaxes.
A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the
snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will
have difficulty reaching them.
Rock Throwing (Ex): The range increment is 120 feet for a
frost giant’s thrown rocks.
Frost Giant Society
Frost giants live in frigid, arctic lands of glaciers and heavy snowfall. They make their lairs in crude castles or frigid caverns. Tribal
leaders call themselves “jarl.” Frost giant groups depend on hunting and raiding, though they sometimes make trading and defensive alliances with neighboring giants.
Frost giants like to take captives. For each ten adult giants in a
tribe, there is a 20% chance that the lair has 1d2 captives. These
prisoners can be any sort of creature.
Frost Giant Characters
Many groups of frost giants include clerics. A frost giant cleric
has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction,

both).

Frost Giant Jarl
A frost giant leader is often a barbarian, cleric, fighter, or sorcerer,
but some of the most evil and ruthless frost giants become blackguards. Ambitious and domineering, they quickly rise to rule their
tribes, and then lead their fellows further and further into cruelty
and wickedness.
The frost giant jarl described here has all the qualities and abilities of a typical frost giant, as well as other abilities (see the statistics block) from being a blackguard. Details on some of these abilities follow.
Aura of Despair (Su): This jarl radiates a malign aura that
causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a –2
penalty on all saving throws.
Aura of Evil (Ex): This jarl radiates a strong
aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) as an 8thlevel cleric of an evil deity.
Command Undead (Su): This jarl can command and rebuke undead as a 6th-level cleric.
Dark Blessing (Su): This jarl applies his
Charisma modifier as a bonus on all saving
throws.
Detect Good (Sp): At will,
this jarl can use detect
good as a spell-like ability, duplicating the
effect of the detect
good spell.
Poison Use: Blackguards are skilled in
the use of poison and
never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying
poison to a blade.
Smite Good (Su): Twice
per day, this jarl may attempt
to smite good with one
normal melee attack. He adds
his +4 Charisma modifier to his
attack roll and deals 8 points of
extra damage (1 per blackguard level) if the attack
hits. If he accidentally
smites a creature that
is not good, the smite
has no effect but it
is still used up for
that day.
Typical Blackguard Spells Prepared (3/1; save
DC 11 + spell
level): 1st—cause fear,
doom, magic weapon; 2nd—bull’s
strength.
Possessions: +2 frost greataxe, +2 full plate armor, cloak of Charisma +2,
ring of minor energy resistance (fire), 2 doses of bloodroot poison.
(Benefits of these items are included in the statistics block.)

This giant has an oddly simian
appearance, with overlong arms,
stooped shoulders, low foreheads,
and thick, powerful limbs.
Hill giants are selfish,
cunning brutes who
survive through hunting and raiding.
Skin color among
hill giants ranges
from light tan to
deep ruddy brown.
Their hair is brown
or black, with eyes
the same color. Hill
giants wear layers of
crudely prepared hides
with the fur left on. They
seldom wash or repair
their garments, preferring to simply add more hides as
their old ones wear out.
Adults are about 10-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 1,100
pounds. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old.
A hill giant’s bag usually contains 2d4 throwing rocks, 1d4+4
mundane items, and the giant’s personal wealth. These possessions tend to be well worn, filthy, and stinky. The items are usually crude and often jury-rigged or salvaged from some similar
item. Examples include a hand chopper made from a broken
battleaxe head, a wooden bowl and spoon, or a drinking cup
made from a big gourd or a skull.
Combat
Hill giants prefer to fight from high, rocky outcroppings, where
they can pelt opponents with rocks and boulders while limiting
the risk to themselves.
Hill giants love to make overrun attacks against smaller creatures
when they first join battle. Thereafter, they stand fast and swing
away with their massive clubs.
Rock Throwing (Ex): The range increment is 120 feet for a hill
giant’s thrown rocks.
Hill Giant Society
Although hill giants prefer temperate areas, they can be found
in practically any climate where there is an abundance of hills
and mountains. Individuals and bands tend to be aggressive
and prefer taking what they want over trading. Tribes (and
some bands) often trade with other giants or with groups of
ogres or orcs to get foodstuffs, trinkets, and servants.
Hill Giants as Characters
Reckless brutes of incredible strength but little wit, hill giant
characters are never truly accepted into society. Yet they do well
on its edges and frontiers, forging a strong and profitable existence. Despite their rugged appearance and great size, their basically humanoid shape makes it easy for them to relate with more
civilized folk.

This giant resembles a lean, muscular human. Its hard, hairless flesh is
smooth and gray. It has gaunt facial features and deep-sunken, black eyes
that makes it seem grim.
Stone giants have a largely undeserved reputation as rock-throwing hooligans. In fact, they tend to be somewhat shy around
strangers.
Stone giants prefer thick leather garments, dyed in shades of
brown and gray to match the stone around them.
Adults are about 12 feet tall and weigh about 1,500 pounds.
Stone giants can live to be 800 years old.
Stone giants may tend to be shy around strangers, but they are
by no means timid. Many stone giants have an artistic streak.
Some draw and paint scenes of their lives on the walls of their lairs
and on tanned hide scrolls. Some are fond of music and play stone
flutes and drums. Others make simple jewelry, fashioning painted
stone beads into necklaces.
Most stone giants are playful, especially at night. They are fond
of rock-throwing contests and other games that test their might.
Groups of giants often gather to toss rocks at each other, the losing
side being those who are hit more often. Travelers’ reports of such
contests have given stone giants their reputation for wildness.
A stone giant’s bag usually contains 2d12 throwing rocks, 1d4+6
mundane items, and the giant’s personal wealth. A stone giant’s
possessions are neither particularly clean nor particularly dirty,
but most of them are made from stone.
Combat
Stone giants fight from a distance whenever possible, but if they
can’t avoid melee, they use gigantic clubs chiseled out of stone.
A favorite tactic of stone giants is to stand nearly motionless,
blending in with the background, then move forward to throw
rocks and surprise their foes.
Rock Throwing (Ex): The range increment is 180 feet for a
stone giant’s thrown rocks. It uses both hands when throwing
a rock.
Rock Catching (Ex): A stone giant gains a +4 racial bonus on
its Reflex save when attempting to catch a thrown rock.
Skills: *A stone giant gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in
rocky terrain.
Stone Giant Elders
Some stone giants develop special abilities related to their environment. These giant elders have Charisma scores of at least 15
and spell-like abilities, which they use as 10th-level sorcerers.
Once per day they can use stone shape, stone tell, and either transmute rock to mud or transmute mud to rock (DC 17). The save DC is
Charisma-based. One in ten elders is a sorcerer, usually of 3rd to
6th level.
Stone Giant Society
Stone giants prefer to dwell in deep caves high on rocky, stormswept mountains. Usually, groups live fairly close together (no
more than a day’s travel apart) for a sense of community and
GIANT
124
protection. Most stone giant lairs have 2d4 neighboring lairs.
Some older stone giants choose to live in solitude, meditating
and creating artwork. Many of them become elders after several decades.
Most groups of stone giants subsist by hunting, gathering, and
herding mountain animals such as sheep or goats. They trade with
any other nearby communities, exchanging foodstuffs and stone
goods for cloth, pottery, and manufactured items. Groups of evil
giants often go raiding or extort tolls from mountain travelers.

This giant resembles a well-formed human of enormous proportions. It
has light green skin, dark green hair, and glittering emerald eyes.
Storm giants are gentle and reclusive. They are usually tolerant of
others but can be very dangerous when angry.
Very rarely, storm giants have violet skin. Violet-skinned storm
giants have deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or
purple eyes. Adults are about 21 feet tall and weigh about 12,000
pounds. Storm giants can live to be 600 years old.
Storm giants’ garb is usually a short, loose tunic belted at the
waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear a few
pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, anklets (favored by
barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. They
live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about
the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land
or gathering food.
Storm giants usually carry their bags attached to their belts
instead of as shoulder sacks. Each of these bags holds a simple
musical instrument (usually a pan pipe or harp) and 2d4 mundane
items. Other than the jewelry they wear, they prefer to leave their
wealth in their lairs. A storm giant’s possessions are usually simple
(if not downright primitive), but well crafted and maintained.
Combat
Storm giants use weapons and spell-like abilities instead of throwing rocks. Their composite longbows have a range increment of
180 feet.
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—call lightning (DC 15), chain lightning (DC 18). Caster level 15th. 2/day—control weather, levitate.
Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Freedom of Movement (Su): Storm giants have a continuous
freedom of movement ability as the spell (caster level 20th). The
effect can be dispelled, but the storm giant can create it again on
its next turn as a free action.
Water Breathing (Ex): Storm giants can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use their spell-like abilities while
submerged.
Skills: A storm giant has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line. *Storm giants ignore all weight penalties
for gear carried when swimming.
Storm Giant Society
Storm giants live in castles built on mountain peaks or underwater. They live off the land in the immediate vicinity of their
lairs. If the natural harvest is not enough to sustain them, they
create and carefully till large gardens, fields, and vineyards. They
do not keep animals for food, preferring to hunt. Land-dwelling
storm giants usually are on good terms with neighboring copper
dragons and good-aligned cloud giants, and cooperate with them
for mutual defense. Water-dwelling storm giants have similar relationships with merfolk and bronze dragons.
Storm Giant Characters
About 20% of adult storm giants are sorcerers or clerics. A storm
giant cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos,
Good, Protection, or War.

This unwholesome creature has
a body with the form and fluidity of an amoeba. Its
surface has the
color, but not the
consistency, of human
flesh. Countless eyes and toothy mouths constantly form and disappear all
over the creature, often retreating into its body even as they become
apparent.
A gibbering mouther is a horrible creature seemingly drawn from
a lunatic’s nightmares. Although not evil, it thirsts after bodily
fluids and seems to prefer the blood of intelligent creatures.
Sometimes the arrangement of eyes and mouths on a gibbering
mouther’s body a resembles a face, but just as often they have no
relationship to one another.
A gibbering mouther is about 3 feet across and 3 to 4 feet high.
It weighs about 200 pounds.
Gibbering mouthers can speak Common, but seldom say anything other than gibberish.
COMBAT
A gibbering mouther attacks by shooting out strings of protoplasmic flesh, each ending in one or more eyes and a mouth that bites
at the enemy. A mouther can send out a total of six such members
in any round.
Gibbering (Su): As soon as a mouther spots something edible,
it begins a constant gibbering as a free action. All creatures (other
than mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13
Will save or be affected as though by a confusion spell for 1d2
rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same gibbering mouther’s gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Spittle (Ex): As a free action every round, a gibbering mouther
fires a stream of spittle at one opponent within 30 feet. The
mouther makes a ranged touch attack; if it hits, it deals 1d4 points
of acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude
save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless creatures are immune
to the blinding effect, but are still subject to the acid damage. The
save DC is Constitution-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gibbering mouther
must hit with a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as
a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
Blood Drain (Ex): On a successful grapple check after grabbing, that mouth attaches to the opponent. It automatically
deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round. A mouth can be ripped off (dealing 1
point of damage) with a DC 12 Strength check or severed by a
successful sunder attempt (the mouth has 2 hit points).
A severed mouth continues to bite and
drain blood for 1d4 rounds after such an
attack. A creature whose Constitution is
reduced to 0 is killed.
Engulf (Ex): A gibbering mouther can try to
engulf a Medium or
smaller opponent
grabbed by three
or more mouths.
The opponent must
succeed on a DC 14
Reflex save or fall
and be engulfed. In
the next round, the
mouther makes
twelve bite attacks instead of
six (each with a +4
attack bonus). An engulfed creature cannot attack
the mouther from within. The previously attached mouths are now free to attack others. The
save DC is Strength-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Ground Manipulation (Su): At will, as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in all adjacent squares
to become a morass akin to quicksand. Softening earth, sand, or
the like takes 1 round, while stone takes 2 rounds. Anyone other
than the mouther in that area must take a move-equivalent
action to avoid becoming mired (treat as being pinned).
Amorphous (Ex): A gibbering mouther is not subject to critical hits. It cannot be flanked.
Skills: Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers have
a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.
A gibbering mouther has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It always can
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.

At first glance, this creature looks like an albino gorilla, but it has four
arms. It also has razor-sharp teeth and long claws.
Girallons are savage, magical cousins of the gorilla. They are
aggressive, bloodthirsty, highly territorial, and incredibly strong.
When moving on the ground, a girallon walks on its legs and
lower arms. An adult girallon is about 8 feet tall, broad-chested,
and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs about 800 pounds.
COMBAT
Girallons attack anything that enters their territory, even others
of their kind. Their senseless belligerence is the one characteristic that keeps their numbers in check. Still, the creatures show
some cunning.
A solitary girallon usually conceals itself in the branches of a
tree or under a pile of leaves and brush, with only its nose showing. When it spots or scents prey, it charges to the attack. A girallon picks up prey that is small enough to carry and withdraws,
often vanishing into the trees before
the victim’s companions can do
anything to retaliate. Against
larger foes, a girallon seeks to
tear a single opponent to bits as
quickly as it can.
Rend (Ex): A
girallon that hits
with two or more claw
attacks latches onto
the opponent’s body
and tears the flesh.
This attack automatically deals an extra
2d4+12 points of damage.
Skills: A girallon has a
+8 racial bonus on Climb
checks and can always
choose to take 10 on a
Climb check, even
if rushed or
threatened.

This tall, gaunt humanoid has rough, yellow skin and russet hair
pulled into a pair of topknots. Its eyes have a sinister gleam, and its
ears are pointed and serrated in back.
Githyanki are an ancient line of humanlike beings residing on
the Astral Plane, filling their armories for their next skirmish,
raid, or war.
Githyanki are gaunt, averaging a little over 6 feet tall and typically weighing around 170 pounds. They enjoy elaborate dress and
baroque armor. In fact, they revere weapons and armor, and it is
not uncommon for a githyanki to show more regard for
panoply of possessions than for its mate.
Like dwarves, githyanki are craftmasters, although they focus
exclusively on items of warfare. Their items are distinctive, and
nongithyanki who acquire them run the risk of immediate retribution should they encounter githyanki.
Githyanki speak their own secret tongue, but most also know
Common and Draconic.
The statistics block describes a 1st-level warrior. Most githyanki encountered outside their homes are fighters. However,
wizards (called warlocks) and multiclass githyanki (called gish)
are also found.
COMBAT
Githyanki are seasoned combatants, familiar with the tactical
use of ambush, cover, and psionic sniper attacks from afar.
However, they prefer to engage their enemies in hand-tohand combat so they can bring their devastating melee weapons to bear. Githyanki weapons are usually greatswords,
bastard swords, and other particularly large-bladed weapons of special githyanki manufacture, all masterwork and
each distinctively decorated and named. Githyanki wizards
GITHYANKI
Girallon

direct their powers with pinpoint accuracy to support their
comrades in melee.
Psionics (Sp): 3/day—daze (DC 9), mage hand. In addition,
githyanki of 3rd level or higher can use blur three times per day,
githyanki of 6th level or higher can use dimension door three times
per day, and githyanki of 9th level or higher can use telekinesis
(DC 14) three times per day and plane shift (DC 16) once per
day. Effective caster level equals the githyanki’s class levels. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spell Resistance (Ex): A
githyanki has spell resistance equal to its class
levels + 5.
The githyanki warrior
presented here had the
following ability scores
before racial adjustments:
Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int
10, Wis 9, Cha 8.
Challenge Rating: Githyanki with levels in NPC
classes have a CR equal to their
character level. Githyanki with
levels in PC classes have a CR
equal to their character level +1.
Githyanki Silver Swords
These impressive weapons are
typically carried by githyanki
combatants of 9th level and
higher. Of githyanki make, a
silver sword is a +1 silvered greatsword that looks much like a
standard weapon while still in
its sheath. But when drawn, the
silver sword transforms into a column of silvery liquid, altering the
weapon’s balance round by round as the
blade’s shape flows and shimmers. A silver
sword has the additional quality of reaching
into the minds of the foes it strikes, disrupting their psionic powers. A target hit by the
weapon must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude
save or lose any psionic abilities for 1d4
rounds.
High-level githyanki often take the
Improved Sunder feat, using their silver
swords to attack astral travelers’ silver cords
(see the astral projection spell, page 201 of
the Player ’s Handbook). The normally
insubstantial cord is treated as a tangible object with the owner’s AC,
hardness 10, and 20 hit points.
It is rumored that each githyanki
warrior has but one silver sword, and if
the weapon is lost or stolen, the
githyanki must seek it out at all costs or be
killed by its superiors. That may be only a
legend, but githyanki have been known to exact terrible revenge
upon those who steal their silver swords or win them in battle.
Some silver swords (belonging to particularly high-level
githyanki) have additional enhancements. Enhancing a silver
sword is just like working with any other weapon that has existing
abilities. A normal githyanki silver sword is treated as having a +2
enhancement for this purpose: +1 for its bonus on attack and
damage rolls and another +1 for the sword’s antipsionic ability.
GITHYANKI SOCIETY
In eons past, the mind flayers enslaved entire races, including the
forerunners of the githyanki. Centuries of captivity bred hatred,
nurtured resolve, and finally instilled psionic powers into these
slaves. With mental armaments of their own and a powerful
leader to rally behind (the legendary Gith), the slaves instigated a
cross-planar struggle that, in the end, threw down the mind
flayer empire, bringing freedom to the surviving slaves. However, these survivors soon split into the racially distinct githyanki
and their mortal enemies, the githzerai (see the
Githzerai entry, below). Each constantly attempts the extinction of the other. This animosity has burned through the centuries, warping the githyanki into the evil, militaristic
creatures they are today. Both creatures’ hatred of
mind flayers knows no bounds, though, and they
will break off hostilities to slay illithids if the
opportunity presents itself.
Githyanki live within massive fortresses adrift
in the Astral Plane. Here they conduct commerce,
manufacture goods, grow food, and live out their
lives. Family dwellings are nonexistent, since
most githyanki prefer their own abode; however, githyanki are often found in groups, honing
their fighting skills. A fortress contains noncombatants (mostly children) equal to 20% of
the fighting population. Githyanki males
and females may be found in almost any
role or class.
The githyanki have no deity but instead
pay homage to a lich-queen. A jealous and
paranoid overlord, she devours the
essence of any githyanki that rises above
16th level. In addition to eliminating a
potential rival, the lich-queen enhances her power with the stolen life
essence.
Red Dragon Pact: Githyanki have a racial pact
with red dragons, which sometimes serve githyanki as
mounts. Individually, githyanki have a +4 racial bonus on
Diplomacy checks when dealing with red dragons. In
large groups, they can make temporary alliances with
red dragons at the option of the Dungeon Master.
GITHYANKI AS CHARACTERS
Most githyanki are fighters. Some of the most powerful
githyanki warlords are blackguards. Githyanki are never
clerics, unless they have forsworn the dreaded lichqueen (which is a perilous and ultimately lethal decision).
Githyanki characters possess the following racial
traits.
— +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, –2 Wisdom.
—Medium size.
—A githyanki’s base land speed is
30 feet.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.

This creature is a thin
and tall humanoid
with sharp features,
a somber face,
and yellow
eyes.
Githzerai are a hard-hearted, humanlike people who dwell on
the plane of Limbo, secure in the protection of their hidden
monasteries.
Githzerai average more than 6 feet tall and weigh about 160
pounds. Some have gray eyes instead of yellow. All of them dress
in drab, unadorned clothing.
As a rule, githzerai are close-mouthed, keep their own counsel,
and trust few outside their own kind.
They speak their own language (similar enough to the tongue of
the githyanki that either could understand the other if they chose
to speak instead of fight), but many also speak Common.
The statistics block describes a 1st-level warrior. Many githzerai are monks; however, sorcerers, rogues, and multiclass
githzerai (called zerths) are also indispensable members of a
monastery.
COMBAT
Able to fight without weapons and armor, githzerai monks yearn
to bring the “good fight” to their enemies, the githyanki and the
mind flayers. In melee, githzerai sorcerers often use their powers
to enhance the monks, warriors, and rogues.
Psionics (Sp): 3/day—daze (DC 9), feather fall, shatter (DC 11). A
githzerai of 11th level or higher can use plane shift (DC 16) once
per day. Effective caster level equals the githzerai’s class levels. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.
Inertial Armor (Sp): Githzerai can use psychic force to block an
enemy’s blows. This ability gives them a +4 armor bonus to AC as
long as they remain conscious. This is the equivalent of a 1stlevel spell.
Spell Resistance (Ex): A githzerai has spell resistance equal to
its class levels + 5.
The githzerai warrior presented here had the following ability
scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex
11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.
Challenge Rating: Githzerai with levels in
NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level.
Githzerai with levels in PC classes have a CR equal to their
character level +1.
GITHZERAI SOCIETY
The githzerai forerunners united under the command of the
rebel Gith (see the Githyanki entry, above) and threw down the
plane -spanning empire of the mind flayers. Once free, the
former slaves split ideologically and eventually racially,
becoming the githzerai and their foes, the githyanki. The
githzerai’s history of imprisonment was the foundation of their monastic lifestyle, in which all githzerai learn from childhood how to eradicate
potential oppressors and enemies (anyone not a
githzerai).
Githzerai live within self-contained, fortresslike monasteries
hidden deep in the swirling chaos of Limbo. While disorder
rules outside, stability holds sway inside. Each monastery is
ultimately under the control of a sensei, a monk of at least
16th level, and follows a strict schedule of chants, meals, martial
arts training, and devotions, according to a particular sensei’s
philosophy. A monastery contains noncombatants (mostly
children) equal to 15% of the fighting population.
Githzerai males and females may be found in almost
any role or class.
Rrakkma: As a special devotion, githzerai sometimes organize mind flayer hunting parties called rrakkma. A rrakkma
consists of 4–5 githzerai of 8th level and 1–2 of 11th level, mainly
monks, but also containing at least one sorcerer and possibly a
rogue. A rrakkma does not return to its home monastery before
slaying at least as many illithids as its membership.
GITHZERAI AS CHARACTERS
Githzerai characters possess the following racial traits.
— +6 Dexterity, –2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom.
—Medium size.
—A githzerai’s base land speed is 30 feet.

This humanoid is slightly taller than a human. It has gray skin, a furry
body, and a head like a hyena’s, with a reddish-gray mane.
Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose
tribes.
Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur.
A gnoll is a nocturnal carnivore, preferring intelligent creatures
for food because they scream more. Gnolls tend to think with
their stomachs, and any alliances they make (usually with bugbears, hobgoblins, ogres, orcs, or trolls) often fall apart when the
gnolls get hungry. They dislike giants and most other humanoids,
and they disdain manual labor.
A gnoll is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.
Gnolls speak Gnoll.
COMBAT
Gnolls like to attack when they have the advantage of numbers,
using horde tactics and their physical strength to overwhelm and
knock down their opponents. They show little discipline when
fighting unless they have a strong leader; at such times, they can
maintain ranks and fight as a unit. While they do not usually prepare traps, they do use ambushes and try to attack from
a flanking position. Because of its shield, a gnoll’s
modifier on Hide checks (untrained) is –2, which
means gnolls always take special care to seek
favorable conditions when laying ambushes (such as darkness, cover, or some
other form of advantageous terrain).
GNOLL SOCIETY
A tribe of gnolls is ruled by its strongest
member, who uses fear, intimidation, and
strength to remain in power. If a chieftain
is killed, the stronger members of the tribe
fight to be the new chieftain; if these combats take too long or several combatants
die, the tribe may break up into a number
of bands that go their separate ways. Gnolls
revere the phases of the moon, but most
tribes have no true clerics.
A band or tribe includes as many noncombatant young as there are adults. Gnoll
lairs are fortified surface encampments or
underground complexes. Gnolls take prisoners for use as slaves, and any lair will have
at least one slave for every ten adults. Slaves
(usually humans, orcs, or hobgoblins)
suffer a high attrition rate because
of the gnolls’ appetite.
Their special patron is the
demon lord Yeenoghu, who
looks like a gaunt gnoll.
Most gnolls serve and revere
Yeenoghu rather than worshiping a
deity.
GNOLL CHARACTERS
Gnoll leaders are usually rangers. Gnoll clerics usually worship
Erythnul, deity of slaughter. A gnoll cleric has access to two of
the following domains: Chaos, Evil, Trickery, or War (favored
weapon morningstar).
GNOLLS AS CHARACTERS
Relentless hunters, gnoll characters often begin their adventures
by tracking a quarry into the world of humankind. There, they
take up the role of bounty hunters and mercenaries.
Gnoll characters possess the following racial traits.
—Strength +4, Constitution +2, Intelligence –2, Charisma –2.
—Size Medium.
—A gnoll’s base land speed is 30 feet.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Racial Hit Dice: A gnoll begins with two levels of humanoid,
which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base
saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.

equal to 5 × (2 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Listen and Spot.

GNOME
This humanoid stands a little more than half as high as a human. It has
a compact build, dark tan skin, fair hair, and large eyes.
Gnomes are inveterate explorers, tricksters, and inventors. They
have a knack for both illusion and alchemy.
Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds.
Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their
hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome
males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally
wear leather or earth tones, though they
decorate their clothes with intricate
stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach
adulthood at about age 40, and they live
about 350 years, though some can live
almost 500 years.
Gnomes are inquisitive. They love to
learn by personal experience. At times
they’re even reckless. Their curiosity
makes them skilled engineers, as they
are always trying new ways to build
things. Sometimes a gnome pulls a
prank just to see how the individuals
involved will react.
Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. Most gnomes who
travel outside gnome lands (as
traders, tinkers, or adventurers)
know Common, while warriors in
gnome settlements usually learn
Goblin.
Most gnomes encountered
outside their home are warriors;
the information in the statistics
block is for one of 1st level.
COMBAT
Gnomes prefer misdirection and
deception over direct confrontation. They would rather befuddle or
embarrass foes (other than goblinoids or kobolds) than kill them.
Gnomes make heavy use of illusion
magic and carefully prepared
ambushes and traps whenever
they can.
Gnome Traits (Ex): Gnomes possess
the following racial traits.
— +2 Constitution, –2 Strength.
—Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1
bonus on attack rolls, +4 bonus
on Hide checks, –4 penalty on
grapple checks, lifting and carrying limits
3/4 those of Medium characters.
—A gnome’s base land speed is 20 feet.
—Low-light vision.
—Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked
hammers (see Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook) as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.
— +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.
—Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against
illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those
from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.
— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).
— +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant
type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).
— +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.
— +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks.
—Automatic Languages: Common, Gnome. Bonus Languages:
Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc.
—Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—speak with animals (burrowing
mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma
score of at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities:
1/day—dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation. Caster level 1st;
save DC 10 + gnome’s Cha modifier + spell level.
—Favored Class: Bard.
The gnome warrior presented here had the following ability
scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10,
Wis 9, Cha 8.
GNOME SOCIETY
Gnomes get along well with
dwarves, who share their love of
precious things, their curiosity
about mechanical devices, and
their hatred of goblins and
giants. They enjoy the company of halflings, especially
those who are easygoing
enough to put up with
pranks and jests. Most
gnomes are a little suspicious of the taller races—
humans, elves, half-elves, and
half-orcs—but they are rarely
hostile or malicious.
Gnomes make their homes in
hilly, wooded lands. They live
underground but get more fresh
air than dwarves, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well
hidden, both by clever construction
and illusions. Those who come to visit
and are welcome are ushered into the
bright, warm burrows. Those who are
not welcome never find the burrows
in the first place.
The chief gnome deity is Garl
Glittergold, the Watchful Protector.
His clerics teach that gnomes are to
cherish and support their communities. Pranks, for example, are seen as
ways to lighten spirits and to keep
gnomes humble, not ways for pranksters to triumph over those they trick.
SUBRACES
The information above is for rock
gnomes, the most common variety.
There are two other major gnome subraces,
which differ from rock gnomes as follows.
GNOME
Rock gnome
131
Svirfneblin
This humanoid stands a little more than half as tall as a human. It has a
wiry, gnarled physique, stone-colored skin, and large gray eyes. It is bald.
Also called deep gnomes, svirfneblin are said to dwell in great
cities deep underground. They keep the location of these cities
secret to protect them from their deadly foes: drow, kuo-toa, and
mind flayers.
A svirfneblin has wiry, rock-colored skin usually medium
brown to brownish gray. Only males are bald; females have stringy
gray hair. The average svirfneblin lifespan is 250 years.
Svirfneblin speak Gnome, Common, and Undercommon.
Svirfneblin Traits (Ex): These traits are in addition to the rock
gnome traits, except where noted.
— –2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, –4 Charisma. These
adjustments replace the rock gnome’s ability score adjustments.
—Stonecunning: This ability grants deep gnomes a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework. A deep gnome
who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make
a Search check as though actively searching, and can use the
Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A svirfneblin
can also intuit depth, sensing the approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.
—Darkvision out to 120 feet and low-light vision.
—Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.
— +2 racial bonus on all saving throws (figured into the statistics for the character presented here). This trait replaces the rock
gnome’s racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.
—Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against
illusion spells cast by svirfneblin. This adjustment stacks with
those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.
— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.
— +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against all creatures (figured
into the statistics for the character presented here). This trait
replaces the rock gnome’s dodge bonus against giants.
—Automatic Languages: Undercommon, Gnome, Common.
Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This
trait replaces the rock gnome’s automatic and bonus languages.
—Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—blindness/deafness (typical save

Forest Gnome
This exceptionally small humanoid has moss-colored skin, dark hair, and
brown eyes.
Shy and elusive, forest gnomes shun contact with other races
except when dire emergencies threaten their beloved homes.
They are the smallest of all the gnomes, averaging 2 to 2-1/2 feet in
height, but look just like regular gnomes except with bark-colored
or gray-green skin, and eyes that can be brown or green as well as
blue. A very long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life
expectancy of 500 years.
Forest Gnome Traits (Ex): These traits are in addition to the
rock gnome traits, except where noted.

This little humanoid has a flat face, broad nose, pointed ears, wide mouth,
and small, sharp fangs. It walks upright, but its arms hang down almost
to its knees.
Goblins are small humanoids that many consider little more than
a nuisance. However, if they are unchecked, their great numbers,
rapid reproduction, and evil disposition enable them to overrun
and despoil civilized areas.
A goblin stands 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds.
Its eyes are usually dull and glazed, varying in color from red to
yellow. A goblin’s skin color ranges from yellow through any
shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe
are about the same color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather,
tending toward drab, soiled-looking colors.
Goblins speak Goblin; those with Intelligence scores of 12 or
higher also speak Common.
Most goblins encountered outside their homes are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.
COMBAT
Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures has taught goblins to
exploit what few advantages they have: sheer numbers and malicious ingenuity. The concept of a fair fight is meaningless in
their society. They favor ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty
tricks, and any other edge they can devise.
Goblins have a poor grasp of strategy and are cowardly by
nature, tending to flee the field if a battle turns against
them. With proper supervision, though, they can implement
reasonably complex plans, and in such circumstances their
numbers can be a deadly advantage.
Skills: Goblins have a +4 racial bonus on Move
Silently and Ride checks. Goblin cavalry (mounted
on worgs) usually select the Mounted Combat feat
in place of the Alertness feat, which reduces their
Spot and Listen check modifiers from +3 to +1.
Challenge Rating: Goblins with
levels in NPC classes have a CR
equal to their character level –2.
GOBLIN SOCIETY
Goblins are tribal. Their
leaders are generally the
biggest, strongest, or
sometimes the smartest
of the group. They have
almost no concept of
privacy, living and sleeping in large common
areas; only the leaders live
separately. Goblins survive
by raiding and stealing
(preferably from those who
cannot defend themselves easily),
sneaking into lairs, villages, and
even towns by night to take what
they can. They are not above waylaying travelers on the road or in forests
and stripping them of all possessions, up
to and including the clothes on their
backs. Goblins sometimes capture slaves to perform hard labor
in the tribe’s lair or camp.
These creatures live wherever they can, from dank caves to
dismal ruins, and their lairs are always smelly and filthy due to
an utter lack of sanitation. Goblins often settle near civilized
areas to raid for food, livestock, tools, weapons, and supplies.
Once a tribe has despoiled a locale, it simply packs up and moves
on to the next convenient area. Hobgoblins and bugbears are
sometimes found in the company of goblin tribes, usually as
bullying leaders. Some goblin tribes form alliances with worgs,
which carry them into combat.
GOBLIN
Goblin

Goblin bands and tribes have noncombatant young equal in
number to the adults.
The chief goblin deity is Maglubiyet, who urges his worshipers to expand their numbers and overwhelm their competitors.
GOBLINS AS CHARACTERS
Goblin leaders tend to be rogues or fighter/rogues. Goblin clerics
worship Maglubiyet. A goblin cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, or Trickery. Most goblin spellcasters
are adepts. Goblin adepts favor spells that fool or confuse enemies.
Goblin characters possess the following racial traits.
— –2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, –2 Charisma.
—Small size: +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls,
+4 bonus on Hide checks, –4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting

GOLEM
Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces.
The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental
Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the
golem’s creator.
COMBAT
Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well.
Being mindless, they do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of
any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat and
cannot be provoked.
A golem’s creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet
and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually
follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked
it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence, such as “Remain in
an area and attack all creatures that enter” (or only a specific type of
creature), “Ring a gong and attack,” or the like. The golem’s creator
can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who
might in turn place the golem under someone else’s control, and so
on), but the golem’s creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone.
Since golems do not need to breathe and are immune to most
forms of energy, they can press an attack against an opponent
almost anywhere, from the bottom of the sea to the frigid top of
the tallest mountain.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): Golems have immunity to most
magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted.
CONSTRUCTION
The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the
physical body and all the materials and spell components that are
consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a
golem is essentially similar to creating any sort of magic item (see
page 282 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). However, a golem’s body
includes costly material components that may require some extra
preparation. The golem’s creator can assemble the body or hire
someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate
skill, which varies with the golem variety.
Completing the golem’s creation drains the appropriate XP
from the creator and requires casting any spells on the final day.
The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come
from outside sources, such as scrolls.
The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a
magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market
price, cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each
golem’s description, in the same format used in Chapter 7 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Note The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with
more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry) is
increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and increased by
an additional 50,000 gp if the golem’s size increases. The XP cost
for creating an advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced
golem’s market price minus the cost of the special materials
required.

This automaton has been sculpted from soft clay. It’s about 18 inches taller
than a normal human, and its features are grossly distorted from the
human norm. Its chest is overly large, with arms attached by thick knots of
muscle at the shoulder, hanging down to its knees, and ending in short,
stubby fingers. It has no neck, and the large head has broad, flat features.
Its legs are short and bowed, ending in wide, flat feet. It smells faintly of clay.
This golem has a humanoid body made from clay.
A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather
garment around its hips.
A clay golem golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise. It
walks and moves with a slow, clumsy gait. It weighs around 600
pounds.

Clay golems are frightening combatants, thanks to their immunities and their haste ability.

a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some
object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then
moving on to spread more destruction. Once a clay golem goes
berserk, no known method can reestablish control.
Cursed Wound (Ex): The damage a clay golem deals doesn’t
heal naturally and resists healing spells. A character attempting to
cast a conjuration (healing) spell on a creature damaged by a clay
golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the spell has
no effect on the injured character.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A clay golem is immune to any spell
or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain
spells and effects function differently against the creature, as
noted below.
A move earth spell drives
the golem back 120 feet and
deals 3d12 points of damage
to it.
A disintegrate spell slows
the golem (as the slow
spell) for 1d6 rounds
and deals 1d12 points
of damage.
An earth uake
spell cast directly
at a clay golem stops
it from moving on its
next turn and deals
5d10 points of damage. The golem gets
no saving throw
against any of these
effects.
Any magical attack
against a clay golem
that deals acid damage
heals 1 point of damage
for every 3 points of
damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount
of healing would cause
the golem to exceed its
full normal hit points, it gains
any excess as temporary hit points.
For example, a clay golem hit by
the breath weapon of a black
dragon heals 7 points of damage if the attack would have
dealt 22 points of damage. A
clay golem golem gets no
saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid
damage.
Haste (Su): After
it has engaged in at
least 1 round of combat, a
clay golem can haste itself once per day as a free action. The effect
lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.
Construction
A clay golem’s body must be sculpted from a single block of clay
weighing at least 1,000 pounds, treated with rare oils and powders
worth 1,500 gp. Creating the body requires a DC 15 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 15 Craft (pottery) check.

This automaton looks as though it was
constructed from a grisly assortment of
decaying human body parts, stitched
and bolted together into a form taller
than a living man. It smells faintly of
freshly dug earth and dead flesh.
A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body
parts, stitched together into a
single composite form.
No natural animal willingly tracks a flesh golem.
The golem wears whatever
clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged
pair of trousers. It has no
possessions and no weapons. It stands
8 feet tall and weighs almost 500
pounds.
A flesh golem golem cannot speak,
although it can emit a hoarse roar of
sorts. It walks and moves with a
stiff-jointed gait, as if not in
complete control of its
body.
Combat
Flesh golems often fare poorly in combat thanks to their fairly low
Armor Class, though they can easily crush foes that lack adamantine weaponry. A flesh golem supported by an ally that can launch
electricity attacks is fearsome indeed.
Berserk (Ex): When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a
cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks
free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on
a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some
object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then
moving on to spread more destruction. The golem’s creator, if
within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and

check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the
golem’s berserk chance to 0%.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A flesh golem is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition,
certain spells and effects function differently against the creature,
as noted below.
A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh
golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow
effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points
of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it
gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a flesh
golem hit by a lightning bolt heals 3 points of damage if the attack
would have dealt 11 points of damage. A flesh golem golem gets
no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.
Construction
The pieces of a flesh golem must come from normal human
corpses that have not decayed significantly. Assembly requires a
minimum of six different bodies—one for each limb, the torso
(including head), and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may
be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also
required. Note that creating a flesh golem requires casting a spell
with the evil descriptor.
Assembling the body requires a DC 13 Craft (leatherworking)
check or a DC 13 Heal check.

This metallic automaton is twice the height of a normal human and
resembles an armored giant.
This golem has a humanoid body made from iron.
An iron golem can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone
golem (see below), although it almost always displays armor of
some sort. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone
golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand.
An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds.
An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does
it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but
smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.
Combat
Iron golems are mighty combatants. They strike with deadly accuracy and incredible force. Their bodies are nearly invulnerable but
can be reduced to piles of rubbish by rust monsters.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): An iron golem is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition,
certain spells and effects function differently against the creature,
as noted below.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron
golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on
the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage
the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would
cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any
excess as temporary hit points. For example, an iron golem hit by
a fireball gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 18 points. An

An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that
of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
Construction
An iron golem’s body is sculpted from 5,000 pounds of pure iron,
smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures costing at least 10,000

STONE GOLEM
This automaton has been cut from stone. It is half again as tall as a
normal human and resembles a roughly chiseled statue of a soldier.
This golem has a humanoid body made from stone.
A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its
body is frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might
look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on
the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs.
Combat
Stone golems are formidable opponents,
being physically powerful and difficult
to harm.
Slow (Su): A stone golem
can use a slow effect, as the
spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of
10 feet and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to
negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A stone golem is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition,
certain spells and effects function differently against the creature,
as noted below.
A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone golem (as the slow
spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to
rock heals all of its lost hit points.
A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem’s structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for
1 full round.
Construction
A stone golem’s body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone,
such as granite, weighing at least 3,000 pounds. The stone must be

GORGON
Gorgon
137
Dusky, metallic scales cover this creature’s bull-like body. It has silver
horns.
Gorgons guard their territory fiercely. They are fond of rocky
areas, especially underground labyrinths.
A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 8 feet from snout to tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.
Gorgons are nothing if not aggressive. They attack intruders
on sight, attempting to trample, gore, or petrify them. There is
no way to calm these furious creatures, and they are impossible
to domesticate.
COMBAT
Whenever possible, a gorgon begins an encounter by charging at
its opponents.
Breath Weapon (Su): 60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds (but
no more than five times per day), turn to stone permanently, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Trample (Ex): Reflex DC 19 half. The save DC is Strengthbased.

This hulking biped has the mass of a giant. It has a
stooped frame, a gray, hairless body, and broad shoulders.
Its arms are long and sinewy, and its clawed hands scrape
along the ground as it walks. Its sloped forehead bears six
small, yellowish eyes. Its mouth is wide and powerful-looking, filled with black teeth.
Bestial and savage, the gray render is a deadly predator found in remote wilderness areas.
These beasts are thought to be composed of dense
muscle and bone, granting them the strength and
stamina of a giant. A gray render stands about 9 feet
tall in spite of its hunched posture and is about 4 feet
wide. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.
Rangers have reported seeing renders uproot trees
3 feet in diameter with their jaws and tear them into
splinters in just minutes.
Gray renders are never found in groups. Each of
these asexual creatures produces one offspring and carries it for a time in a pouch, but thereafter the young
render must fend for itself.
A unique quality of the gray render is its tendency to bond
with, protect, and provide for another creature (or group of creatures) native to its surroundings. This strange behavior seems
contrary to its otherwise savage nature, yet gray renders have
been found with wolves, lions, horses, displacer beasts, owlbears,
unicorns, hippogriffs, and occasionally even humanoid groups.
Whether accepted or not, the render always attempts to remain
fairly close, watching over its adopted charge(s) and daily bringing an offering of meat. It never willingly harms adopted creatures and retreats if they attack it. Most adopted creatures quickly
begin to appreciate having such a powerful ally and accept and
even rely on the gray render.
COMBAT
A gray render attacks to kill, whether to bring down prey or to protect itself or those it has adopted. When hunting, it sometimes
attempts to hide and wait for prey to wander close.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gray render must hit
with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
Rend (Ex): A gray render that wins a grapple check after a successful bite attack establishes a hold, latching onto the opponent’s
body and tearing the flesh. This attack automatically deals 2d6+9
points of damage.
Skills: Gray renders have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks due
to their six keen eyes.

This wormlike monster has a body as long as a man is tall, with four
tentacles a little longer than human forearms. The tentacles, located
on its head along either side of its jaws, are segmented, as is the
body itself.
Gricks are stealthy underground predators that infest dungeons,
caves, and other shadowed places under the earth, waiting patiently for prey to come within reach.
An adult grick is about 8 feet long from the tips of its tentacles
to the end of its body and weighs some 200 pounds. Its body coloration is uniformly dark, with a pale underbelly.
Gricks lair in any sheltered space that can
accommodate their bodies, including holes,
burrows, ledges, and crevices. They do not collect treasure, but their lairs are likely to contain the uneaten possessions of their victims.
When prey is scarce, gricks venture aboveground and hunt in the wilderness, using tactics similar to those they employ underground. These creatures are not comfortable
under the open sky, however, and return to
the subterranean world as quickly as possible.
COMBAT
Gricks attack when hungry or threatened.
They hunt by holing up near high-traffic
areas, using their natural coloration to
blend into convenient shadows. When prey
(virtually anything that moves) ventures
near, they lash out with their tentacles. A
grick’s rubbery body seems to shed blows of
any kind. Its jaws are relatively small and
weak compared to its body mass, so rather
than consume its kill immediately, a grick
normally drags its victim back to its lair to
be eaten at its leisure.
A grick’s natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Multiple gricks do not fight in concert.
Each attacks the prey closest to it, and breaks
off the fight as soon as it can drag dead or
unconscious prey away.
Skills: A grick has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or
threatened.
*Their coloration affords gricks a +8 racial bonus on Hide
checks when in natural rocky areas.

This beast’s body resembles that of a muscular lion. Its head and front
legs are those of a great eagle, and it has a pair of large, golden wings.
GRIFFON
139
Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures with the characteristics of both lions and eagles. They hunt all manner of prey but
favor the flesh of horses above all else.
From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8
feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair
of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature’s back and span
25 feet or more. A griffon weighs about 500 pounds.
Griffons make their homes in high places, swooping down
with a shrill, eaglelike cry to attack their prey. Although both
aggressive and territorial, they are also intelligent enough to
avoid obviously powerful enemies. They almost always attack
horses, however, and any who attempt to protect horses from a
hungry griffon often end up on the menu themselves.
A griffon cannot speak, but understands Common.
COMBAT
Griffons prefer to pounce on their prey, either diving to the attack
or leaping from above.
Pounce (Ex): If a griffon dives upon or charges a foe, it can
make a full attack, including two rake attacks.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +8 melee, damage 1d6+2.
Skills: Griffons have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Spot
checks.
TRAINING A GRIFFON
Although intelligent, a griffon requires training before it can bear a
rider in combat. To be trained, a griffon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful
Diplomacy check). Training a friendly griffon requires six weeks of
work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a griffon requires
an exotic saddle. A griffon can fight while carrying a rider, but the
rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
Griffon eggs are worth 3,500 gp apiece on the open market,
while young are worth 7,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge
1,500 gp to rear or train a griffon.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a griffon is up to 300
pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load,
601–900 pounds.

This muscular humanoid is about as tall as a human. It has thick, gray,
scaly skin and blank, eyeless eye sockets.
Grimlocks are natives of the deep places beneath the earth but
come to the surface to raid for slaves and pillage. While there,
they lurk in mountainous terrain, which hides them well. They
prefer raw, fresh meat—preferably human.
Extremely xenophobic, grimlocks are normally encountered in
small patrols or packs on the surface. Underground, they may
form larger communities that are led by powerful grimlocks
or by some more intelligent creature, such as a medusa or a
mind flayer.
Grimlocks speak their own language and Common.
COMBAT
Grimlocks are blind, but their exceptional senses of smell
and hearing allow them to notice foes nearby. As
a result, they usually shun ranged weapons and rush to the attack, brandishing their stone battleaxes.
Blindsight (Ex): Grimlocks
can sense all foes within 40 feet as a
sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they
treat all targets as having total concealment.
Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based
attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud
noises and sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence)
and overpowering odors (such as stinking cloud or
incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock’s sense of
smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal
Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both these senses are
negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.
Immunities: Grimlocks are immune to
gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and
other attack forms that rely on sight.
Skills: *A grimlock’s dull gray skin helps it hide in
its native terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks
when in mountains or underground.

GUARDINAL
Guardinals are a celestial race native to the
plane of Elysium. When at home, they are
among the most peaceful of creatures, quick to
laugh and slow to anger. They show a very different
face when away from Elysium, however—they have
no tolerance for evil and often rove the cosmos looking
for evil to confront.
Guardinals speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can
speak with almost any creature, thanks to their tongues ability.
Guardinal Traits: A guardinal possesses the following traits
(unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Immunity to electricity and petrification.
—Resistance to cold 10 and sonic 10.
—Lay on Hands (Su): As the paladin class feature, except that
each day, a guardinal can heal an amount of damage equal to its full
normal hit points.
— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.
—Speak with Animals (Su): This ability works like speak with
animals (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require
sound.

This creature has the body of a tall, muscular human, but with long,
powerful wings instead of arms. The face is more human than avian, but
the hair resembles a feathery cowl, and the eyes are bright gold. The legs
have strong talons and feathery vanes.
An avoral’s bones are strong but hollow, so even the largest
specimens weigh no more than 120 pounds. An avoral is
about 7 feet tall.
Each of an avoral’s wings has a small hand at the midpoint.
When the wings are folded, these appendages are about where
human hands would be and can do nearly anything hands can do.
An avoral’s visual acuity is virtually unmatched: It can see detail
on objects up to 10 miles away and is said to be able to discern the
color of a creature’s eyes at 200 paces.
Combat
On the ground, an avoral can lash out with its wings to deliver punishing blows. However, it prefers to meet its foes in the air, where
it can employ its talons and make full use of its aerial speed and
agility. It can’t make wing attacks while flying, however.
An avoral’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—aid, blur (self only), command
(DC 14), detect magic, dimension door, dispel magic, gust of wind (DC
15), hold person (DC 16), light, magic circle against evil (self only),
magic missile, see invisibility; 3/day—lightning bolt (DC 16). Caster
level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Fear Aura (Su): Once per day an avoral can create an aura of
fear in a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise identical with fear from an
8th-level caster (save DC 17). The save DC is Charisma-based.
True Seeing (Su): This ability is identical with true seeing (caster
level 14th), except that it has personal range and the avoral must
concentrate for 1 full round before it takes effect. Thereafter the
ability remains in effect as long as the avoral concentrates on it.
Skills: An avoral’s sharp eyes give it a +8 racial bonus on Spot
checks.

This creature looks like a powerful humanoid about 6 feet tall, covered in
short, golden fur. Its head is leonine in appearance, with a short muzzle
and a lush, dark gold mane. Its arms end in powerful claws, and its mouth
holds rows of long, sharp teeth.
One of the most powerful guardinal forms, a leonal is every bit as
regal as a lion of the Material Plane. As a foe, it can be just as terrifying, bellowing mighty roars and slashing with razor-sharp claws.
Combat
Leonals like their battles as straightforward as can be. They begin
with a roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with a
frenzy of claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with
others in their pride, watching one another’s flanks and setting up
devastating attacks.
A leonal’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Roar (Su): A leonal can roar up to three times per day. Each roar
releases a blast in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a holy
word spell and deals an extra 2d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude
DC 20 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Pounce (Ex): If a leonal charges a foe, it can make a full attack,
including two rake attacks.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a leonal must hit
with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can rake.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +20 melee, damage 1d6+8.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—detect thoughts, fireball (DC 15),
hold monster (DC 17), polymorph, wall of force; 3/day—cure critical
wounds (DC 16), neutralize poison, remove disease; 1/day—heal (DC
18). Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
—Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created
by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC
and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet
of the leonal. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect
and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster
level equals leonal’s HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are
not included in a leonal’s statistics block.)

HAG
Hags are horrible creatures whose love of evil is equaled only by
their ugliness.
Although they often plot and scheme for power or some malevolent end, hags also appear to do evil for its own sake. They may
use their dark magic and knowledge of fell things to serve a more
powerful evil being, but they are seldom faithful. They may turn
on their master if they see a chance to seize power for themselves.
Although different hags are unique in appearance and mannerism, they have many aspects in common. All take the form of
crones whose bent shapes belie their fierce power and swiftness.
Despite faces cracked by wrinkles and heavy with cruelty, their
eyes shine with villainy and cunning. Their long nails have the
strength of steel and are as keen as any knife.
Hags speak Giant and Common.
COMBAT
Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to
spells and can cast magic of their own. Hags often gather to form
coveys. A covey, usually containing one hag of each type, can use
powers beyond those of the individual members.

Alignment: Usually chaotic evil
Advancement: By character class
Level Adjustment: —
This creature looks like an ancient female human, but impossibly tall. It
has deep blue skin and filthy black hair.
The dreaded annis may be the most horrible of hags. An annis
commonly uses its disguise self ability to take the form of an exceptionally tall human, a fair giant, or an ogre.
An annis stands some 8 feet tall and weighs about 325 pounds.
Combat
Though physically powerful, these hags do not favor simple
assaults but try to divide and confuse their foes before combat.
They love to pose as commoners or gentlefolk to lull their victims
into a sense of false security before they attack.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an annis must hit a
Large or smaller opponent with a claw attack. It can then attempt
to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +13 melee, damage 1d6+7. An annis
can attack a grappled foe with both claws at no penalty.
Rend (Ex): An annis that hits with both claw attacks latches
onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d6+10 points of damage.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—disguise self, fog cloud. Caster

This creature looks like a very old female
human. It has a sickly green complexion
with dark, tangled hair that looks almost
like a twisted vine.
Green hags are found in desolate swamps
and dark forests.
A green hag is about the same height and weight as a
female human.
Combat
Green hags prefer to attack from hiding, usually after distracting
foes. They often use darkvision to their advantage by attacking
during moonless nights.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—dancing lights, disguise self, ghost
sound (DC 12), invisibility, pass without trace, tongues, water breathing.
Caster level 9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Weakness (Su): A green hag can weaken a foe by making a special touch attack. The opponent must succeed on a DC 16 FortiHAG
Green hag

tude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Mimicry (Ex): A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost
any animal found near its lair.
Skills: A green hag has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.

This creature looks like an old female human. Its flesh is sickly and yellow,
covered with warts and oozing sores. Its long, filthy hair resembles rotting
seaweed.
Perhaps the most wretched of hags, the sea hag is found in the
water of seas or overgrown lakes.
A sea hag is about the same height and weight as a female
human.
Combat
Sea hags are not subtle and prefer a direct approach to combat.
They usually remain in hiding until they can affect as many foes as
possible with their horrific appearance.
Horrific Appearance (Su): The sight of a sea hag is so revolting
that anyone (other than another hag) who sets eyes upon one
must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened,
taking 2d6 points of Strength damage. This damage cannot reduce
a victim’s Strength score below 0, but anyone reduced to Strength
0 is helpless. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hag’s
horrific appearance for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Evil Eye (Su): Three times per day, a sea hag can cast its dire
gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be dazed for three days, although
remove curse or dispel evil can restore sanity sooner. In addition, an
affected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or die
from fright. Creatures with immunity to fear effects are not
affected by the sea hag’s evil eye. The save DCs are Charismabased.
Amphibious (Ex): Although sea hags are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.
Skills: A sea hag has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.
HAG COVEY
From time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually this
foul triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always the
case.
Combat
Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.
A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4
evil giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised with a veil spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as
spies. Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as hag
eyes (see below).
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—animate dead, bestow curse (DC 17),
control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana (DC 18),
polymorph, veil (DC 19), vision. Caster level 9th. The save DCs are
based on a Charisma score of 16. To use one of these abilities
(which requires a full-round action), all three hags must be within
10 feet of one another, and all must participate.
Once per month, a covey that does not have a hag eye can create
one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).
Hag Eye
A hag eye is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a gem of seeing or other
such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a hag eye is worn
as a ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who
created the hag eye can see through it whenever they wish, so long
as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A hag eye has
hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Destroying a hag eye deals 1d10
points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the one
who sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours.
HALF-CELESTIAL
A celestial’s magical nature allows it to breed with virtually any
creature. The offspring of the resulting unions, half-celestials, are
glorious and wonderful beings.
To carry out their responsibilities, celestials sometimes spend
great amounts of time in mortal realms. Being devoted and kind,
they occasionally fall in love with mortals: humans, elves, unicorns, and similar creatures. The objects of celestial affection are
never evil and are always intelligent. They always return the love
of their immortal paramour and willingly conceive the child, usually caring for it since the celestial has other duties.
No matter the form, half-celestials are always comely and
delightful to the senses, having golden skin, sparkling eyes,
angelic wings, or some other sign of their higher nature.
Though noble and compassionate, half-celestials are often dismayed at the evil among their kin and take a stern, sometimes
harsh, view of base instincts or malevolent actions. Never truly fitting into any mortal society, half-celestials are usually loners and
wanderers attempting to right wrongs wherever they can.
SAMPLE HALF-CELESTIAL
This noble knight seems human, but he has golden eyes, and a large pair
of white-feathered wings spreads from his shoulders.

The half-celestial paladin is a champion of good, a roving knight
whose courage in the face of danger is legendary.
Combat
The half-celestial paladin strives to meet his foes in blade-to-blade
combat, resorting to flyby attacks only when confronted by a number
of dangerous foes. Against a powerful evil creature, the half-celestial
paladin readies himself for close combat with his spells and spell-like
abilities, and then makes good use of his ability to smite evil.
Daylight (Su): Half-celestials can use daylight (as the spell) at
will as a standard action.
Smite Evil (Su): Twice per day, this half-celestial paladin may
attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. He adds his +4
Charisma modifier to his attack roll and deals 9 points of extra
damage (1 per paladin level) if the attack hits. If he accidentally
smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect but it is
still used up for that day.
Also, once per day this half-celestial paladin can make a normal
melee attack with no additional bonus to deal 9 points of extra
damage against an evil foe (this is a benefit of the half-celestial
template).
Spell-Like Abilities (Half-Celestial): 3/day—protection from
evil; 1/day—aid, bless, cure serious wounds (DC 17), dispel evil (DC 19),
holy smite (DC 18), neutralize poison, remove disease. Caster level 9th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Turn Undead (Su): This paladin turns undead as a 6th-level
cleric.
Aura of Courage (Su): This paladin has immunity to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of him gains a +4
morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.
Aura of Good (Ex): This half-celestial paladin radiates a strong
aura of good (see the detect good spell) as the 9th-level cleric of a
good deity.
Detect Evil (Sp): At will, this paladin can use detect evil, as the
spell.
Divine Grace (Su): This paladin applies his Charisma modifier
as a bonus on all saving throws.
Divine Health (Ex): This paladin has immunity to all diseases,
including supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot
and lycanthropy).
Lay on Hands (Su): This paladin can cure up to 36 points of
damage per day.
Remove Disease (Sp): Half-celestial paladins can use remove disease
twice per week as a spell like ability (this is the paladin’s class feature). A half-celestial also has the ability to use remove disease as a
half-celestial spell-like ability (see above).
Typical Paladin Spells Prepared (2/1; save DC 13 + spell level):
1st—bless weapon, divine favor; 2nd—bull’s strength.
Possessions: +2 mithral breastplate, +2 large steel shield, +2 bastard
sword, masterwork composite longbow (+4 Str bonus), 10 silvered
arrows, 10 cold iron arrows. (Different half-celestials may have different possessions.)
CREATING A HALF-CELESTIAL
“Half-celestial” is an inherited template that can be added to any
living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher
and nonevil alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
A half-celestial uses all the base creature’s statistics and special
abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes to outsider. Do not
recalculate the creature’s Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size
is unchanged. Half-celestials are normally native outsiders.
Speed: A half-celestial has feathered wings and can fly at twice
the base creature’s base land speed (good maneuverability). If the
base creature has a fly speed, use that instead.
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with
any natural armor bonus the base creature has).
Special Attacks: A half-celestial retains all the special attacks of
the base creature and also gains the following special abilities.
Daylight (Su): Half-celestials can use a daylight effect (as the
spell) at will.
Smite Evil (Su): Once per day a half-celestial can make a normal
melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of
+20) against an evil foe.
Spell-Like Abilities: A half-celestial with an Intelligence or
Wisdom score of 8 or higher has two or more spell-like abilities,
depending on its Hit Dice, as indicated on the table below. The
abilities are cumulative; a half-celestial wyrmling brass dragon (4
HD) can use protection from evil and bless as well as aid and detect evil.
Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster
level equals the creature’s HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
HD Abilities
1–2 Protection from evil 3/day, bless
3–4 Aid, detect evil
5–6 Cure serious wounds, neutralize poison
7–8 Holy smite, remove disease
9–10 Dispel evil
11–12 Holy word
13–14 Holy aura 3/day, hallow
15–16 Mass charm monster
17–18 Summon monster IX (celestials only)
19–20 Resurrection
HALFDRAGON

Special Qualities: A half-celestial has all the special qualities of
the base creature, plus the following special qualities.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Immunity to disease.
—Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10.
—Damage reduction: 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if
HD 12 or more).
—A half-celestial’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
—Spell resistance equal to creature’s HD + 10 (maximum 35).
— +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poison.
Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4,
Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4.
Skills: A half-celestial gains skill points as an outsider and has
skill points equal to (8 + Int modifier) × (HD +3). Do not include
Hit Dice from class levels in this calculation—the half-celestial
gains outsider skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the
normal amount of skill points for its class levels. Treat skills from
the base creature’s list as class skills, and other skills as cross-class.
Challenge Rating: HD 5 or less, as base creature +1; HD 6 to
10, as base creature +2; HD 11 or more, as base creature +3.
Alignment: Always good (any).
Level Adjustment: Same as base creature +4.
HALF-CELESTIAL CHARACTERS
Half-celestial humanoids often have a character class, preferring
bard, cleric, fighter, and paladin. Nonhumanoids are also sometimes clerics or paladins. Half-celestial clerics serve good deities
such as Ehlonna, Heironeous, Kord, or Pelor.
HALF-DRAGON
A dragon’s magical nature allows it to breed with virtually any
creature. Conception usually occurs while the dragon has
changed its shape; it then abandons the crossbreed offspring.
Half-dragon creatures are always more formidable than others
of their kind that do not have dragon blood, and their appearance
betrays their nature—scales, elongated features, reptilian eyes,
and exaggerated teeth and claws. Sometimes they have wings.
SAMPLE HALF-DRAGON
This powerful humanoid has black, scaled skin, sharp claws and fangs,
and a pair of forward-curving horns above its eyes.
Here is an example of a half-dragon using a 4th-level human
fighter as the base creature and a black dragon as the nonhuman
parent.

CREATING A HALF-DRAGON
“Half-dragon” is an inherited template that can be added to any
living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
A half-dragon uses all the base creature’s statistics and special
abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes to dragon. Size is
unchanged. Do not recalculate base attack bonus or saves.
Hit Dice: Increase base creature’s racial HD by one die size, to a
maximum of d12. Do not increase class HD.
Speed: A half-dragon that is Large or larger has wings and can
fly at twice its base land speed (maximum 120 ft.) with average
maneuverability. A half-dragon that is Medium or smaller does
not have wings.
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4.
Attack: A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack,
and the claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can use weapons, the half-dragon retains this ability. A halfdragon fighting without weapons uses a claw when making an
attack action. When it has a weapon, it usually uses the weapon
instead.
Full Attack: A half-dragon fighting without weapons uses both
claws and its bite when making a full attack. If armed with a
weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack and its
bite as a natural secondary attack. If it has a hand free, it uses a
claw as an additional natural secondary attack.
Damage: Half-dragons have bite and claw attacks. If the base
creature does not have these attack forms, use the damage values
in the table below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base
creature’s damage values, whichever are greater.

HALF-FIEND
A fiend’s magical nature allows it to breed
with virtually any creature. Spawned deep
in the dark, nether planes, these fiendish
offspring are abominations that
plague mortal creatures.
Demons and devils bring
their progeny along to the
Material Plane and loose
them upon the world.
Sometimes, however,
fiends force themselves on mortal creatures
to create evil half-breeds. The more depraved
creatures are sometimes even willing to participate. Although half-fiend offspring are usually
destroyed at birth, some survive to become
grotesque mockeries of their mortal parents. All too rarely, though, one learns
from and takes on the characteristics of its
nonfiendish parent, turning from its evil heritage.
No matter its form, a half-fiend is always hideous to behold,
having dark scales, horns, glowing red eyes, bat wings, a fetid odor,
or some other obvious sign that it is tainted with evil.
Never truly fitting into any mortal society, half-fiends are usually loners. On the lower planes, they are mistreated and derided
because of their impure nature. Among nonfiends, they are outcasts, hated corruptions of the natural order. Humanoid halffiends are sometimes called cambions. They often serve more
powerful fiends or lead evil creatures on the Material Plane.
SAMPLE HALF-FIEND
This winged humanoid has claws, fangs, and short horns. Its eyes glow
red, and it reeks of brimstone.

CREATING A HALF-FIEND
“Half-fiend” is an inherited template that can be added to any
living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more
and nongood alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
A half-fiend uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes to outsider. Do not
recalculate Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged. Half-fiends are normally native outsiders.
Speed: A half-fiend has bat wings. Unless the base creature has
a better fly speed, the creature can fly at the base creature’s base
land speed (average maneuverability).
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with
any natural armor bonus the base creature has).
Attack: A half-fiend has two claw attacks and a bite attack, and
the claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can
use weapons, the half-fiend retains this ability. A half-fiend fighting without weapons uses a claw when making an attack action.
When it has a weapon, it usually uses the weapon instead.
Full Attack: A half-fiend fighting without weapons uses both
claws and its bite when making a full attack. If armed with a
weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack and its
bite as a natural secondary attack. If it has a hand free, it uses a
claw as an additional natural secondary attack.
Damage: Half-fiends have bite and claw attacks. If the base
creature does not have these attack forms, use the damage values
in the table below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base
creature’s damage values, whichever are greater.

Special Attacks: A half-fiend retains all the special attacks of
the base creature and gains the following special attack.
Smite Good (Su): Once per day the creature can make a normal
melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of
+20) against a good foe.
Spell-Like Abilities: A half-fiend with an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 8 or higher has spell-like abilities depending on its
Hit Dice, as indicated on the table below. The abilities are cumulative; a half-fiend with 4 HD can use darkness as well as desecrate.
Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster
level equals the creature’s HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
HD Abilities
1–2 Darkness 3/day
3–4 Desecrate
5–6 Unholy blight
7–8 Poison 3/day
9–10 Contagion
11–12 Blasphemy
13–14 Unholy aura 3/day, unhallow
15–16 Horrid wilting
17–18 Summon monster IX (fiends only)
19–20 Destruction
Special Qualities: A half-fiend has all the special qualities of
the base creature, plus the following special qualities.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Immunity to poison.
—Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10.
—Damage reduction: 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if
HD 12 or more).
—A half-fiend’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons
for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
—Spell resistance equal to creature’s HD + 10 (maximum 35).
Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4,
Dex +4, Con +2, Int +4, Cha +2.
Skills: A half-fiend gains skill points as an outsider and has skill
points equal to (8 + Int modifier) × (HD + 3). Do not include Hit
Dice from class levels in this calculation—the half-fiend gains
outsider skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the
normal amount of skill points for its class levels. Treat skills from
the base creature’s list as class skills, and other skills as cross-class.
Challenge Rating: HD 4 or less, as base creature +1; HD 5 to
10, as base creature +2; HD 11 or more, as base creature +3.
Alignment: Always evil (any).
Level Adjustment: +4.
HALF-FIEND CHARACTERS
Humanoid half-fiends often have a character class, preferring
cleric, fighter, rogue, and sorcerer. Rogues and fighters frequently
take levels in the assassin and blackguard prestige classes, respectively. Nonhumanoids are also sometimes clerics or sorcerers.

This humanoid stands about half as high as
a human. It has an athletic build, ruddy skin,
straight black hair, and dark eyes.
Halflings are cunning, resourceful survivors
and opportunists who find room for
themselves wherever they can. They
might be reliable, hard-working citizens or thieves just waiting for their
big chance.
Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and
usually weigh between 30 and 35
pounds. They have brown or
black eyes. Halfling men often
have long sideburns, but beards are rare among them
and mustaches almost unseen. Halflings prefer simple,
comfortable, and practical clothes. Unlike members of most races,
they prefer actual comfort to shows of wealth. Halflings reach
adulthood in their early twenties and generally live into the
middle of their second century.
Halflings speak Halfling and Common.
Most halflings encountered outside their home are warriors;
the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.
COMBAT
Halflings prefer to fight defensively, usually hiding and launching
ranged attacks as the foe approaches. Their tactics are very much
like those of elves but place more emphasis on cover and concealment and less on mobility.
Halfling Traits (Ex): Halflings possess the following racial
traits.
— +2 Dexterity, –2 Strength.
—Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls,
+4 bonus on Hide checks, –4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting
and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters.
—A halfling’s base land speed is 20 feet.
— +2 racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.
— +1 racial bonus on all saving throws.
— +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This bonus
stacks with the halfling’s +1 bonus on saving throws in general.
— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and
slings.
— +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.
—Automatic Languages: Common, Halfling. Bonus Languages:
Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Orc.
—Favored Class: Rogue.
The halfling warrior presented here had the following ability
scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10,
Wis 9, Cha 8.
HALFLING SOCIETY
Halflings try to get along with everyone else. They are adept at fitting into communities of humans, dwarves, elves, or gnomes and
making themselves valuable and welcome. Since human society
changes more frequently than the societies of the longer-lived
races, it most frequently offers opportunities to exploit, and halflings are often found in or around human lands.
Halflings often form tight-knit communities in human or dwarven cities. While they work readily with others, they often make
friends only among themselves.
Halflings also settle into secluded
places where they set up self-reliant
villages.
Halfling communities are known to
pick up and move en masse to a place
that offers some new opportunity,
such as where a new mine has opened up or
to a land where a devastating
war has made skilled workers
hard to find. If these opportunities are
temporary, a community may pick up and
move again once the opportunity is
gone, or once a better one presents
itself. If the opportunity is lasting,
the halflings settle and form
a new village. Some communities, on the other
hand, take to traveling as a
way of life, driving wagons
or guiding boats from place to
place, with no permanent home.
The chief halfling deity is Yondalla, the Blessed One,
protector of the halflings. Yondalla promises blessings and protection to those who heed her guidance, defend their clans, and cherish their families.
SUBRACES
The information above is for the lightfoot halfling, the most
common halfling variety. There are two other major halfling subraces, which differ from lightfoot halflings as follows.
Tallfellow
This humanoid stands a little more than half as high as a human. It has
a slim but athletic build, fair skin, and fair hair.
HALFLING
Halfling
149
HARPY
Harpy
150
Tallfellows are somewhat rare among halfling folk.
Tallfellows are 4 feet tall or more and weigh between 30 and 35
pounds. They generally speak Elven in addition to Common and
Halfling, and they greatly enjoy the company of elves.
Tallfellow Traits (Ex): These traits are in addition to the lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.
— +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks. Like an
elf, a tallfellow who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check as though actively looking for it. This trait replaces the lightfoot’s +2 bonus on Listen
checks.
—Tallfellows are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do
not have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.
Deep Halfling
This humanoid stands a little less than half as high as a human. It has a
stocky but athletic build, ruddy skin, straight black hair, and dark eyes.
These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common
lightfeet.
Deep halflings are about 2-1/2 tall and weigh between 30 and 35
pounds. Deep halflings take great pleasure in gems and fine
masonry, often working as jewelers or stonecutters. They rarely
mix with humans and elves but enjoy the company of dwarves
and speak Dwarven fluently.
Deep Halfling Traits (Ex): These traits are in addition to the
lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Stonecunning: Like dwarves, deep halflings have a +2 racial
bonus on checks to notice unusual stonework. Something that
isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual
stonework. A deep halfling who merely comes within 10 feet of
unusual stonework can make a check as though actively searching and can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a
rogue can. A deep halfling can also intuit depth, sensing the
approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can
sense which way is up.
— +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and Craft checks that
are related to stone or metal.
—Deep halflings are less athletic than lightfoot halflings
and do not have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move
Silently checks.
HARPY
This creature looks like an evil-faced old human with the
lower body, legs, and wings of a reptilian monster. Its hair is
tangled, filthy, and crusted with blood.
A more malignant and wretched creature than the
harpy is difficult to imagine. Taking great glee in causing suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always
watching for new victims.
A harpy’s coal-black eyes clearly reflect its evil soul, as
do the wicked talons on its knotty fingers. These vile
creatures wear no clothing and often wield large, heavy
bones as though they were clubs.
Harpies like to entrance hapless travelers with their
magical songs and lead them to unspeakable torments.
Only when a harpy has finished playing with its new “toys”
will it release them from suffering by killing and consuming
them.
COMBAT
When a harpy engages in battle, it prefers to use Flyby Attack and
strike with a melee weapon.
Captivating Song (Su): The most insidious ability of the harpy
is its song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies)
within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or
become captivated. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A
creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the
same harpy’s song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
A captivated victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most
direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area
(through flame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second
saving throw. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than
to defend themselves. (Thus, a fighter cannot run away or attack
but takes no defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet of the
harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the monster’s
attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for
1 round thereafter. A bard’s countersong ability allows the captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.
Skills: Harpies have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Listen
checks.
HARPY ARCHER
A cruel hunter and roaming brigand, the harpy archer has trained
as a fighter specializing in ranged combat. Harpy archers often
become mercenaries, selling their services to the highest bidder.
When not employed, they make ends meet as highway robbers,
forcing merchant caravans to pay protection money.
Combat
Captivating Song (Su): Will DC 17 negates.
Possessions: +3 studded leather, +1 frost composite longbow (+1 Str
bonus), 10 cold iron arrows, 10 silvered arrows, 5 +2 arrows, lesser
bracers of archery, potion of cure moderate
wounds, potion of cat’s grace, cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +1. (Different
harpy archers may have different possessions.)
HELL HOUND
The creature resembles a big, powerfully built dog with short, rust-red fur;
its markings, teeth, and tongue are sooty black. It has red, glowing eyes.
Hell hounds are aggressive, fire-breathing canines from the plane
of Acheron. Specimens are frequently brought to the Material
Plane to serve evil beings, and many have established indigenous breeding populations.
A typical hell hound stands 4-1/2 feet high at the shoulder and weighs 120 pounds.
Hell hounds do not speak but understand Infernal.
COMBAT
Hell hounds are efficient hunters. A favorite pack
tactic is to surround prey quietly, then attack
with one or two hounds, driving it toward the
rest with their fiery breath. If the prey doesn’t
run, the pack closes in. Hell hounds track fleeing prey relentlessly.
A hell hound’s natural weapons, as well as
any weapons it wields, are treated as evilaligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.
Breath Weapon (Su): 10-foot cone, once
every 2d4 rounds, damage 2d6 fire, Reflex
DC 13 half. The save DC is Constitutionbased.
Fiery Bite (Su): A hell hound deals an
extra 1d6 points of fire damage every time it
bites an opponent, as if its bite were a flaming weapon.
Skills: Hell hounds have a +5 racial bonus on
Hide and Move Silently checks.
*They also receive a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks
when tracking by scent, due to their keen sense of smell.
NESSIAN WARHOUND
The Lords of the Nine, the great devil princes who rule over the
Nine Hells, keep vast kennels of hell hounds. From the fiery pits
beneath the palace of Asmodeus in Nessus, the
lowest of the Nine Hells, come the Nessian
warhounds, a terrifying breed of hell
hound. Nessian warhounds are coalblack mastiffs the size of draft
horses, often fitted with shirts of
infernal chainmail.
Nessian warhounds resemble hell hounds, except as
otherwise noted.
Breath Weapon
(Su): 10-foot cone,
once every 2d4
rounds, damage
3d6 fire, Reflex DC
21 half. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Fiery Bite
(Su): A Nessian
warhound deals
an extra 1d8
points of fire

it bites an
opponent,
as if its bite
were a flaming
weapon.

This beast has the torso and hindquarters of a horse and the forelegs,
wings, and head of a giant eagle.
Hippogriffs are aggressive flying creatures that combine features
of horses and giant eagles. Voracious omnivores, hippogriffs will
hunt humanoids as readily as any other meal.
These beasts are very territorial, defending their preferred hunting and grazing areas against intruders with unusual ferocity.
Their range usually extends about 5d10 miles from their nest, in
which the young remain while the adults hunt. Hippogriffs never
leave their young undefended, however: Discovering a hippogriff
nest always means encountering adult creatures.
A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a wingspan of 20 feet, and
weighs 1,000 pounds.
COMBAT
Hippogriffs dive at their prey and strike with their clawed
forelegs. When they cannot dive, they slash with claws and beak.
Mated pairs and flights of these creatures attack in concert,
diving repeatedly to drive away or kill intruders. Hippogriffs fight
to the death to defend their nests and their hatchlings, which are
prized as aerial mounts and fetch a handsome price in many civilized areas.
Skills: Hippogriffs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.
TRAINING A HIPPOGRIFF
A hippogriff requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.
Training a hippogriff requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a hippogriff requires an exotic saddle. A
hippogriff can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot
also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
Hippogriff eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market,
while young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge
1,000 gp to rear or train a hippogriff.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a hippogriff is up to 300
pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load,
601–900 pounds.

This burly humanoid
stands about 6-1/2
feet tall. It has hairy
skin, feral eyes, and a
flat nose and chin.
Hobgoblins are larger
cousins of goblins. They are
far more aggressive and
organized than their
smaller relatives and wage a perpetual
war with other humanoids, particularly elves.
Hobgoblins’ hair color ranges from
dark reddish-brown to dark gray. They have
dark orange or red-orange skin. Large males have
blue or red noses. Hobgoblins’ eyes are yellowish or dark brown,
while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather. Their weaponry is
kept polished and in good repair.
Hobgoblins speak Goblin and Common.
Most hobgoblins encountered outside their homes are warriors;
the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.
COMBAT
These creatures have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and
are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under
the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate elves
and attack them first, in preference to other opponents.
Skills: Hobgoblins have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently
checks.
The hobgoblin warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12,
Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.
HOBGOBLIN SOCIETY
Hobgoblins are a military breed: They live for war and believe
strongly in strength and martial prowess as the most desirable
qualities for individuals and leaders alike. A hobgoblin leader is
likely to be the biggest and strongest in the group, maintaining
authority by enforcing strict discipline. Hobgoblins are often
leaders among tribes of goblins and orcs, whom they bully and
treat as inferiors. Hobgoblin mercenaries sometimes enter the
service of wealthy evil humanoids.
HOBGOBLIN

Hobgoblin society is organized into tribal bands, each intensely
jealous of its reputation and status. Meetings between rival bands
are likely to erupt in violence if the troops are not restrained. Only
an exceptionally powerful leader can force them to cooperate for
any length of time. Each band has a distinctive battle standard that
it carries into combat to inspire, rally, and signal the troops. Hobgoblin gangs and warbands are almost exclusively male. Bands and
tribes include females who help with defense. Noncombatant hobgoblins are children too young to fight effectively.
These creatures usually make lairs in places that either boast
natural defenses or can be fortified. Cavern complexes, dungeons,
ruins, and forests are among their favorites. Typical lair defenses
include ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude
catapults or ballistas.
Most hobgoblins revere Maglubiyet, who is also the patron
deity of goblins.
HOBGOBLIN CHARACTERS
Hobgoblin leaders tend to be fighters or fighter/rogues. Hobgoblin clerics worship Maglubiyet. A hobgoblin cleric has access to
two of the following domains: Evil, Destruction, or Trickery. Most
hobgoblin spellcasters, however, are adepts. Hobgoblin adepts
favor spells that deal damage.
Hobgoblin characters possess the following racial traits.
— +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution.
—A hobgoblin’s base land speed is 30 feet.

creatures are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts.
A homunculus’s creator determines its precise features.
Homunculi are little more than tools designed to carry out
assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing the
same alignment and basic nature. A homunculus cannot speak,
but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its master knows and can convey to him or her
everything it sees and hears, out to a distance of 1,500 feet. A
homunculus never travels beyond this range willingly, though it
can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to regain contact with its master. An attack that
destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master.
If the creature’s master is slain, the homunculus also dies, and its
body swiftly melts away into a pool of ichor.
COMBAT
Homunculi land on their victims and bite with their venomous
fangs.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage sleep for 1
minute, secondary damage sleep for another 5d6 minutes. The
save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
CONSTRUCTION
A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ashes, mandrake
root, spring water, and one pint of the creator’s own blood. The
materials cost 50 gp. The creature’s master may assemble the body
or hire someone else to do the job. Creating the body requires a
DC 12 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 12 Craft (pottery) check.
After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended
magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or
workroom, similar to an alchemist’s laboratory and costing 500 gp
to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature’s
body, the building and ritual can be performed together.
A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but
each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create.
Craft Construct (see page 303), arcane eye, mirror image, mending,
caster must be at least 4th level; Price — (never sold); Cost 1,050
gp + 78 XP.

HOMUNCULUS
Homunculus

Environment: Windswept Depths of Pandemonium
Organization: Solitary, gang (2–4), or pack (6–10)
Challenge Rating: 3
Treasure: None
Alignment: Always chaotic evil
Advancement: 7–9 HD (Large); 11–18 HD (Huge)
Level Adjustment: +3 (cohort)
This creature looks like some gaunt, bestial hound or feline, with a mane
of bristling quills.
Howlers live on planes where chaos and evil hold sway; they originate on the plane of Pandemonium. These beasts hunt in packs,
racing through caverns to wear down their prey and rend it to bits.
A howler is about 8 feet long and weighs about 2,000 pounds.
Although they are surprisingly intelligent, howlers do not
speak—they only howl. If there is a language within the howls, as
some have suggested, even spells cannot decipher it. Howlers
understand Abyssal.
COMBAT
Howlers attack in groups, for they are cowardly and cruel. They
prefer to charge into combat, race out, and then charge in again.
A howler’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Quills (Ex): A howler’s neck bristles with long quills. While
biting, the creature thrashes about, striking with 1d4 of
them. An opponent hit by a howler’s quill attack must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or have the quill break off
in his or her flesh. Lodged quills impose a –1 penalty
on attacks, saves, and checks per quill. The save DC is
Dexterity-based.
A quill can be removed safely with a DC 20
Heal check; otherwise, removing a quill
deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.
Howl (Ex): All beings other than
outsiders that hear the creature’s
howling for an hour or longer are
subject to its effect, though it does
not help the howler in combat.
Anyone within hearing range of a
howler for a full hour must succeed on a
DC 12 Will save or take 1 point of
Wisdom damage. The save DC is
Charisma-based. The save must
be repeated for each hour of
exposure. This is a sonic mindaffecting effect.
TRAINING A
HOWLER
Small and Medium infernal creatures such as quasits, abyssal orcs,
and even succubi sometimes use howlers as mounts or pack animals. Larger and more powerful demons use them like hunting
dogs.
Although intelligent, a howler requires training before it can
bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a howler must have a friendly
attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly howler requires six
weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a
howler requires an exotic saddle. A howler can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a howler is up to 460
pounds; a medium load, 461–920 pounds; and a heavy load,
921–1,380 pounds. A howler can drag 6,900 pounds.
HYDRA
This beast resembles some great reptile with a veritable forest of heads on
long, slender necks.
Hydras are reptilelike monsters with multiple heads; they can
quickly tear apart all but the most well-armored foes.
A hydra is gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan
underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white. It is
about 20 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds.
Hydras do not speak.
COMBAT
Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if they
move or charge during the round.
A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must make a successful
sunder attempt with a slashing weapon. (The player should
declare where the attack is aimed before making the attack roll.)
Making a sunder attempt provokes an attack of opportunity
unless the foe has the Improved Sunder feat. An opponent can
strike at a hydra’s heads from any position in which he could strike
at the hydra itself, because the hydra’s head writhe and whip about
in combat. An opponent can ready an action to attempt to sunder
a hydra’s head when the creature bites at him.
Each of a hydra’s heads has hit
points equal to the creature’s full
normal hit point
total, divided by
its original number of
heads. For example, if a
five-headed hydra
has 52 hit points, 10 or
more points of
damage severs a
head (52 ÷ 5
10.4, rounded down to 10).
Losing a head deals
damage to the body
equal to half the
head’s full normal hit
points. A natural
reflex seals the
neck shut to prevent further blood
loss. A hydra can no
longer attack with a
severed head but takes
no other penalties.
Each time a head is severed,
two new heads spring from the
stump in 1d4 rounds. A hydra can never have more than
twice its original number of heads at any one time, and any extra
heads it gains beyond its original number wither and die within a
day. To prevent a severed head from growing back into two heads,
at least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump
H YDR A
BEHIND THE CURTAIN: HYDRAS
Hydras are intended to be monsters that are difficult to defeat by
conventional means. Characters without the Improved Sunder feat will
find it difficult and dangerous to attack by lopping off the monster’s
heads, and the hydra’s fast healing ability means that damage directed
at its body is quickly restored. The hydra rewards characters who have
the Improved Sunder feat and parties who learn to coordinate their
p
attacks effectively.

(a touch attack to hit) before the new heads appear. A flaming
weapon (or similar effect) deals its energy damage to the stump in
the same blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid damage
from an area effect (such as a fireball spell or dragon breath) may
burn multiple stumps in addition to dealing damage to the hydra’s
body. A hydra does not die from losing its heads until all its heads
have been cut off and the stumps seared by fire or acid.
A hydra’s body can be slain
just like any other creature’s, but hydras possess
fast healing (see below)
and are difficult to defeat
in this fashion. Any attack that is not (or
cannot be) an attempt to sunder a
head affects the
body. For example, area
effects deal
damage to a
hydra’s body,
not to its heads.
Targeted magical effects cannot sever a
hydra’s heads (and
thus must be directed
at the body) unless they
deal slashing damage
and could be used
to make sunder
attempts.
Fast Healing (Ex): Each round, a hydra heals damage equal to
10 + the number of its original heads.
Skills: Hydras have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks,
thanks to their multiple heads.
A hydra has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take
10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight
line.
Feats: A hydra’s Combat Reflexes feat
allows it to use all its heads for attacks of
opportunity.
PYROHYDRA
Huge Magical Beast (Fire)
These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire
10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet
long. All heads breathe once every
1d4 rounds. Each jet deals 3d6
points of fire damage per
head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The
save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra’s
original number of heads
+ hydra’s Con modifier.

INEVITABLE
Hailing from the lawful neutral plane of Mechanus, inevitables
are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws of the
universe.
Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has
violated a fundamental principle, such as “The guilty should be
punished,” “Bargains should be kept,” or “Everyone dies eventually.” When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission,
then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables
insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using geas
and mark of justice to ensure compliance. From its first step, an
inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no
matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. If unable to cross an
ocean any other way, inevitables have been known to
walk into the waves, traversing the seabed to emerge
on another continent
months later.
Inevitables are
single-minded in
pursuit of their
quarry, but they
are under orders to
leave innocents alone.
Accomplices to their
prey are fair game,
however, which sometimes creates conflicts within their
programming. Even the
most effective inevitables are periodically
recalled to Mechanus for reprogramming.
In e v i t a b l e s
gladly sacrifice
themselves to
complete a
mission, but
they aren’t
suicidal. Faced
with impending
defeat, they are
likely to withdraw
and seek a way to
even the odds. They are
determined but
patient foes. They
ally with others if
that helps accomplish their mission,
but they have a
hard time keeping
allies for long.
It’s apparent
to anyone who
spends much time
with one that an inevitable would
sacrifice an ally to fulfill its purpose without a
second thought.
When an inevitable completes its task, it wanders the landscape
and passively observes life around it. When it discerns another
transgression of the principle it is dedicated to, it has a new mission. Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they’re in
observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Those
in the know who hear about a 12-foot-tall, golden-armored statue
roaming the countryside might seek out the inevitable and present a case, hoping it will take on the alleged transgressor. The decision is based on the idiosyncrasies of the inevitable’s programming, so there’s no guarantee.
Their forms vary, but all inevitables are gold-and-silver clockwork creatures, with gears and pistons where muscles would be
on flesh-and-blood creatures. Their eyes glow with a golden
radiance.
Note that unlike most constructs, inevitables have an Intelligence score and can think, learn, and remember.
Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the native language of their first target.
COMBAT
Unless their very
existence is threatened, inevitables
focus completely on the transgressor they’ve
been assigned
to, ignoring other
combatants completely. An inevitable might attack
anyone who hinders its progress,
but it won’t tarry
beyond the point
where it can
reengage its
quarry.
Inevitables take
self-defense very
seriously; anyone
who attacks an inevitable with what
the creature perceives as deadly
force is met with
deadly force in return.
An inevitable’s natural
weapons, as well as any
weapons it wields, are
treated as lawfulaligned for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Fast Healing (Ex): An inevitable
heals a certain amount of damage each
round (specified in each variety’s description) as
long as it has at least 1 hit point. However, damage dealt by chaotic
weapons heals at the normal rate.

This creature looks like a red-skinned humanoid made up of mechanical
parts. It is dressed in ornate golden armor and a flowing golden robe. It
carries a gleaming sword and wears banded mail.
Kolyaruts represent the ultimate enforcement clause in a contract—they mete out punishment to those who break bargains
and oaths. Originally sent from Mechanus to avenge major betrayals, once on the Material Plane they hunt down everyone from unscrupulous merchants to army deserters. Anyone who reneges on
a deal could draw the ire of a kolyarut, although the creature usually ignores inconsequential deals and rashly sworn oaths.
Before beginning a mission against a deal-breaker, a kolyarut
learns as much about the contract or oath as possible. It’s not interested in those who break deals accidentally or against their will—
only those who willingly break contracts violate the principle that
kolyaruts are created to uphold. If a written contract was broken,
the kolyarut typically carries a copy of the contract with it.
Kolyaruts are the most talkative of the inevitables, making credible attempts at social niceties such as proper greetings before getting down to the matter at hand. They can use disguise self to appear
as almost any kind of humanoid—useful if they need to go undercover to catch their quarry.
Combat
Like all inevitables, a kolyarut is patient enough to study a target
before striking. It has a good idea of the deal-breaker’s abilities and
defenses before it enters battle. When it fights, it tries to get the
conflict over as soon as possible, minimizing excess bloodshed
and mayhem. It doesn’t let concern for innocents delay or endanger its mission, however.
A kolyarut’s favorite tactic is to use invisibility or disguise self to
sneak close, then eliminate the quarry with its vampiric touch ability before it can react. A kolyarut has no compunctions about using
its vampiric touch ability on allies to increase its own power, if
doing so helps it complete its mission.
A kolyarut’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Enervation Ray (Su): A kolyarut can fire a black enervation
ray at targets within 200 feet. The effect is identical with the enervation spell (caster level 13th).
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—discern lies (DC 17), disguise self,

geas uest. Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Vampiric Touch (Su): As a melee touch attack, a kolyarut can
steal life force from its foe, as the vampiric touch spell (caster level
13th).
Skills: A kolyarut has a +4 racial bonus on Disguise, Gather
Information, and Sense Motive checks.

Maruts represent the inevitability of death. They confront those
who would try to deny the grave itself.
Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span (such as
a lich) could be targeted by a marut. Those who take extraordinary
measures to cheat death in some other way (such as sacrificing
hundreds of others to keep oneself safe from a plague) might be
labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to reverse
death (raise dead spells, for example) aren’t worthy of a marut’s attention unless they do so repeatedly or on a massive scale.
When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and
implacably toward the foe, never resting.
INEVITABLE
159
Combat
Once it has found its target, a marut brings it the death it has been
trying to avoid. Those who defile death through necromancy may
instead receive a geas and/or mark of justice to enforce proper respect. It typically uses wall of force to shut off any escape routes,
then opens up with chain lightning while it closes to melee range.
Once there, it strikes with its massive fists, using circle of death if
beset by numbers of defenders. It hits spellcasting opponents with
repeated uses of greater dispel magic, and it uses dimension door and
locate creature to track down foes who flee.
A marut’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Fists of Thunder and Lightning (Su): A marut’s left fist delivers a loud thunderclap whenever it hits something, dealing an
extra 3d6 points of sonic damage and causing the target to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the deafness). Its
right fist delivers a shock for an extra 3d6 points of electricity
damage, and the flash of lightning causes the target to be blinded
for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the blindness). The save
DCs are Strength-based and include the marut’s Ability Focus feat.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—air walk, dimension door, fear (DC

This clockwork creature resembles a centaur in shape. It wears ornate
golden armor over alabaster skin. It carries no weapons or other equipment.
Zelekhuts are charged with hunting down those who would deny
justice—especially those who flee to escape punishment. Expert
trackers, they use a combination of natural skill and magic to find
fugitives wherever they may hide.
A zelekhut may initially appear rather nonthreatening—but
when it is about to enter combat, it can cause two spiked chains to
spring forth from its forearms as a free action. In similar fashion, it
can cause a pair of golden metallic wings to emerge from its back.
Retracting the chains or the wings is also a free action.
Combat
Once it has found its fugitive, a zelekhut uses its speed and its
spell-like abilities to cover the most likely escape routes. Then it
immobilizes any defenders while attempting to protect any innocent bystanders. Finally, it apprehends the fugitive with its spiked
chains, tripping or disarming the foe as needed. If the sentence is
death, the zelekhut carries it out with little fuss or fanfare.
A zelekhut’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—clairaudience clairvoyance, dimensional anchor, dispel magic, fear (DC 16), hold person (DC 15), locate creature, true seeing; 3/day—hold monster (DC 17), mark of justice; 1/week—
lesser geas (DC 16). Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Skills: A zelekhut has a +4 racial bonus on Search and Sense
Motive checks.
Feats: Due to its centaurlike construction, a zelekhut qualifies
for feats as if it had the Mounted Combat feat.

Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of
Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon
them to perform specific tasks.
A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the
summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the
task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it
resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert
its instructions accordingly.
Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A see invisibility spell
shows only a dim outline of a cloud, while a true seeing spell reveals
a roiling cloud of vapor.
These creatures speak only Auran but can understand
Common.
INVISIBLE
STALKER
160
COMBAT
An invisible stalker attacks by using the air itself as a weapon. It
creates a sudden, intense blast of wind that pounds a single target
on the same plane as the creature.
An invisible stalker can be killed only when it is on the Elemental Plane of Air. When performing a task elsewhere, it automatically returns to its home plane when it takes damage sufficient to destroy it.
Natural Invisibility (Su): This ability is constant, allowing a
stalker to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is
inherent and not subject to the invisibility purge spell.
Improved Tracking (Ex): An invisible stalker is a consummate
tracker and makes Spot checks instead of the usual Survival
checks to trace a creature’s passage.

This humanoid is about the size of a gnome or halfling. It has a scaly hide,
a naked tail like that of a rat, and a doglike head with two small horns.
Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with cowardly and sadistic
tendencies.
A kobold’s scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty
black color. It has glowing red eyes. Its tail is nonprehensile.
Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange.
Kobolds usually consume plants or animals but are not averse to
eating intelligent beings. They spend most of their time fortifying
the land around their lairs with traps and warning devices (such as
spiked pits, tripwires attached to crossbows, and other mechanical
contraptions).
Kobolds hate almost every other sort of humanoid or fey, especially gnomes and sprites.
A kobold is 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds.
Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a
yapping dog.
COMBAT
Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds—at least two to
one—or trickery; should the odds fall
below this threshold, they usually flee.
However, they attack gnomes on sight
if their numbers are equal.
They begin a fight by slinging bullets,
closing only when they can see that their
foes have been weakened. Whenever they
can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped
areas. They aim to drive enemies into the
traps, where other kobolds wait to pour flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin onto them.
Light Sensitivity (Ex): Kobolds are dazzled
in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.
Skills: Kobolds have a +2 racial bonus on Craft
(trapmaking), Profession (miner), and Search
checks.
The kobold warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13,
Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.
Challenge Rating: Kobolds with levels in NPC

KOBOLD SOCIETY
Kobolds live in dark places, usually underground locations and
overgrown forests. They are good miners and often live in the
mines they are developing. A kobold tribe sends out warbands

that patrol within a 10-mile radius from the lair, attacking any
intelligent creatures that enter their territory. Kobolds usually kill
prisoners for food but occasionally sell some of them as slaves.
Their nasty habits and their distrust of most other beings mean
that they have many enemies.
A kobold lair has one noncombatant child and one egg per ten
adults.
The patron deity of the kobolds is Kurtulmak, who despises all
living creatures except kobolds.
KOBOLD CHARACTERS

This creature resembles an immense squid, with a streamlined body, two
staring eyes, and a mass of tentacles. Its body is approximately 30 feet
long and protected by layers of thick muscle.
Aggressive, cruel, and highly intelligent, krakens rule entire undersea regions. Though these behemoths are rarely seen on the
surface, stories tell of ships dragged under and islands scoured of
life by these monsters.
Krakens make their lairs thousands of feet below the ocean surface. They frequently inhabit huge cavern complexes that include
sections filled with breathable air, where they imprison and breed
humanoid slaves to serve and feed them.
Six of the beast’s tentacles are shorter arms about 30 feet long;
the remaining two are nearly 60 feet long and covered with barbs.
Its beaklike mouth is located where the tentacles meet the lower
portion of its body.
Krakens speak Common and Aquan.
COMBAT
Krakens strike their opponents with their barbed tentacles, then
grab and crush with their arms or drag victims into their huge
jaws. An opponent can make sunder attempts against a kraken’s
tentacles or arms as if they were weapons. A kraken’s tentacles
have 20 hit points, and its arms have 10 hit points. If a kraken is
currently grappling a
target with one
tentacle or arm,
it usually uses
a n o t h e r
limb to make
its attack of opportunity against the sunder attempt. Severing a
kraken’s tentacle or arm deals damage to the kraken equal to half the limb’s full
normal hit points. A kraken usually withdraws
from combat if it loses both tentacles or three of its
arms. A kraken regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the kraken
must hit with an arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
can constrict.
Constrict (Ex): A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle
damage with a successful grapple check.
Jet (Ex): A kraken can jet backward once per round as a fullround action, at a speed of 280 feet. It
must move in a straight line, but does
not provoke attacks of opportunity
while jetting.
K R A K E N
Kraken
162
Ink Cloud (Ex): A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in
an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken normally uses to
escape a fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are
considered to be in darkness.
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—control weather, control winds, dominate animal (DC 18), resist energy. Caster level 9th. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Skills: A kraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.

This creature seems to combine the worst features of a wolf and a hyena.
It has a shaggy, spotted coat, a bristling mane along its spine, and a long,
bushy tail.
The krenshar is a strange, catlike carnivore with extremely flexible skin on its head.
A typical krenshar measures 4 or 5 feet in length with a long,
narrow head. It weighs about 175 pounds. Males and
females hunt together, preferring herd animals for
food but attacking humanoids when game
becomes scarce. Krenshars are very
social among their own kind, and occasional attempts to domesticate
cubs have produced fierce and
loyal companions. They otherwise behave much like mundane great cats. A lair contains cubs numbering half
the adult total.
COMBAT
Krenshars use solitary scouts to drive
prey into the waiting clutches of
the pride. The scout appears
from hiding, uses its scare
ability, then chases the fleeing target to join the attack.
Scare (Ex or Su): As a standard action, a krenshar can pull the
skin back from its head, revealing the musculature and bony
structures of its skull. This alone is usually sufficient to scare away
foes (treat as a Bluff check with a +3 bonus).
Combining this scare ability with a loud screech produces an
unsettling effect that works like a scare spell from a 3rd-level
caster (Will DC 13 partial). A creature that successfully saves
cannot be affected again by the same krenshar’s scare ability for
24 hours. The shriek does not affect other krenshars. This is a
supernatural, sonic mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Skills: Krenshars have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Move
Silently checks.

KUO-TOA
Krenshar
163
This humanoid is a little shorter than a human. Its rounded body is
covered with fine scales, giving it the appearance of being pudgy or
bloated. The arms and legs are slender, almost willowy, ending in broad
hands and distended feet that look much like flippers. Its fishlike, bulletshaped head has bulging, silver-black eyes and a
wide mouth full of sharp teeth.
The kuo-toas are an ancient line of aquatic
humanoids noted for their sinister nature
and diabolical tendencies.
Although most individuals shun contact
with these loathsome creatures, sometimes
avoiding them is simply not possible. Kuotoas know much about long-forgotten, ancient
evils dwelling in the deepest parts of the ocean.
An average kuo-toa stands roughly 5 feet tall
and weighs about 160 pounds.
Although kuo-toas are generally a silver-gray
color, their pigmentation changes with their
mood. An angry kuo-toa is dark red, while a
frightened one becomes pale gray or even white.
The air around a kuo-toa carries a strong odor of
rotting fish.
Kuo-toas speak Kuo-Toan, Undercommon, and
Aquan.
COMBAT
Kuo-toa tactics and weapons vary greatly depending
upon the training and skills of the individual
encountered. A group of kuo-toa fighters usually
fights in formation, throwing spears before closing to
melee range.
Lightning Bolt (Su): Two or more
kuo-toa clerics (known as whips) operating together can generate a stroke
of lightning every 1d4 rounds. The
whips must join hands to launch
the bolt but need merely be
within 30 feet of one another
while it builds. The lightning
bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity
damage per whip, but a successful
Reflex save (DC 13 + number of
whips) halves this amount.
Pincer Staff: Many kuo-toa
fighters and all whips of 7th
level or higher carry this Large
exotic weapon. A pincer staff deals
1d10 points of bludgeoning damage,
threatens a critical hit on a natural
20, and deals double damage on a critical hit. It has a 10-foot reach and
cannot be used against an adjacent
opponent. A wielder that hits an opponent of at least Small but no larger
than Large size can attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking
an attack of opportunity. If the wielder wins
the grapple check, the staff establishes a hold and grabs the opponent, dealing 1d10 points of
damage each round the hold is
maintained.
Adhesive (Ex):
Kuo-toas use their own body oil and other materials to give
their shields a finish almost like flypaper, holding fast any
creatures or items touching them. Anyone who makes an unsuccessful melee attack against a kuo-toa must succeed on a DC
14 Reflex save, or the attacker’s weapon sticks to the shield and is
yanked out of the wielder’s grasp. Creatures using natural weapons are automatically grappled if they get stuck.
A kuo -toa requires 1 hour and special
materials costing 20 gp to coat a shield
with adhesive. The adhesive remains
good for up to three days or until it
actually catches someone or something (in which case the shield can
trap no additional items, since the
adhesive is used up). Pulling a stuck
weapon or limb from a shield requires a
DC 20 Strength check.
Amphibious (Ex): Although kuotoas breathe by means of gills, they can
survive indefinitely on land.
Keen Sight (Ex): Kuo-toas have excellent
vision thanks to their two independently
focusing eyes. Their eyesight is so keen that
they can spot a moving object or creature
even if it is invisible or ethereal. Only
by remaining perfectly still can such
objects or creatures avoid their notice.
Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to
bright light (such as sunlight or a daylight spell)
blinds kuo -toas for 1 round. On subsequent
rounds, they are dazzled while operating in
bright light.
Slippery (Ex): All kuo-toas secrete an oily film that makes
them difficult to grapple or snare. Webs, magical or otherwise,
don’t affect kuo-toas, and they usually can wriggle free from most
other forms of confinement.
Skills: Kuo-toas have a +8 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks
and a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.
A kuo-toa has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It
can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a
straight line.
KUO-TOA SOCIETY
Kuo-toas dwell in subterranean communities that are well supplied with pools for recreation and
breeding. They spawn as fish do,
raising their young in special
pools until their amphibian
qualities develop (about a year
after hatching).
Thanks to the efforts of the whips,
virtually all kuo-toas are devoted worshipers of the goddess Blibdoolpoolp, whom they refer
to as the Sea Mother. Every kuo-toa community has at
least one shrine to the Sea Mother. Larger communities with major temples serve as hubs for clusters
of smaller settlements. These are also centers
for intergroup trade and politics. Virtually all
kuo-toa communities are open to drow
and their servants, who provide
useful goods and services, although
the drow are both feared and hated
by the kuo-toas. This enmity leads
to many minor skirmishes
and frequent kidnappings between
the two societies.

KUO-TOA CHARACTERS
A kuo-toa’s favored class is rogue. Most kuo-toa leaders are

domains: Destruction, Evil, or Water. Kuo-toa monks, called monitors, also exist.

Lamias are evil and cruel creatures that take pleasure in causing suffering. They particularly target those who serve the cause of good.
A typical lamia is about 8 feet long and weighs about 700
pounds.
COMBAT
Though a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has
no stomach for a fair fight. It uses its illusion abilities to lure
heroes into perilous situations, and then uses its Spring Attack
feat to bound out of the shadows and drain Wisdom from its opponents. When it has sapped the will of its victim, it uses its enchantment abilities to beguile and ensnare the unfortunate soul. A
lamia forced into physical combat attacks with a dagger in one of
its human hands and a pair of lionlike claws.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—disguise self, ventrilo uism;
3/day—charm monster (DC 15), major image (DC 14), mirror image,
suggestion (DC 14); 1/day—deep slumber (DC 14). Caster level 9th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Wisdom Drain (Su): A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom
each time it hits with its melee touch attack. (Unlike with other
kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia does not heal any damage
when it uses its Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to use this power early
in an encounter to make foes more susceptible to charm monster
and suggestion.
Skills: Lamias have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Hide checks.
LAMMASU
This creature has the golden-brown body of a lion, the wings of a giant
eagle, and the face of a human.
Lammasus are noble creatures that are concerned with the welfare
and safety of all good beings.
These creatures dwell most often in old, abandoned temples
and ruins located in remote areas, where they contemplate how
best to combat the influence of evil in the world. Adventurers
sometimes seek them out to gain the benefit of their wisdom and
their knowledge of ancient mysteries. Lammasus receive good
beings and creatures cordially and usually offer assistance if the
visitor is directly combating evil. They tolerate neutral beings but
watch them carefully. They do not tolerate the presence of evil
beings, attacking them on sight.
The demeanor of a lammasu is noble and stern, but these creatures can be quite compassionate.
A typical lammasu is about 8
feet long and weighs about 500
pounds.
Lammasus speak Common, Draconic,
and Celestial.
COMBAT
A lammasu attacks with spells or its
razor-sharp claws. It almost always
enters combat if it observes a good creature being threatened by evil.
Spells: A lammasu casts spells as a
7th-level cleric, and can choose
spells from the cleric spell list, plus
any two of the following domains:
Good, Healing, Knowledge, or Law.
Typical leric Spells Prepared (6/6/5/4/2; save DC 13 + spell level):
0—detect magic, guidance (2), light, read magic, resistance; 1st—bless

3rd—daylight, dispel magic, magic circle against evil*, remove curse;
4th—holy smite , neutralize poison.
*Domain spell. Domains: Good and Healing.
Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A lammasu radiates a continuous magic circle against evil that affects a 20-foot radius.
Spell-Like Abilities: 2/day—greater invisibility (self only);
1/day—dimension door. Caster level 7th.
Pounce (Ex): If a lammasu charges a foe, it can make a full
attack, including two rake attacks.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +12 melee, damage 1d6+3.
Skills: Lammasus have a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.

GOLDEN PROTECTOR
(CELESTIAL HALF-DRAGON LAMMASU)
Child of a celestial lammasu and a gold dragon, the golden protector has migrated to the Material Plane to more actively
combat evil.

The golden protector’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Breath Weapon (Su): 30-foot cone, 1/day, damage 6d8 fire,

golden protectors may have different possessions.)
LICH
A lich is an undead spellcaster, usually a wizard or sorcerer but
sometimes a cleric or other spellcaster, who has used its magical
powers to unnaturally extend its life.
As a rule, these creatures are scheming and, some say, insane.
They hunger for ever greater power, long-forgotten knowledge,
and the most terrible of arcane secrets. Because the shadow of
death does not hang over them, they often conceive plans taking
years, decades, or even centuries to come to fruition.
A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh
stretched tight across horribly visible bones. Its eyes have long ago
been lost to decay, but bright pinpoints of crimson light burn on
in the empty sockets. Even the least of these creatures was a powerful person in life, so they often are draped in once-grand clothing. Multiclass fighters or clerics may still bear the armor of a warrior. Like its body, however, the garb of a lich shows all too well the
weight of years. Decay and corruption are its constant companion.
Liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in
life.
SAMPLE LICH
This skeletal creature wears the rotting, rich robes of a mighty wizard long
dead. Hateful crimson light dances in its empty eye sockets.
This example uses an 11th-level human wizard as the character.

CREATING A LICH
“Lich” is an acquired template
that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter
as the base creature), provided it
can create the required phylactery;
see The Lich’s Phylactery, below.
(Liches of other kinds of creatures, such as dragons, exist,
but use different templates.)
A lich has all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities
except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not
recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is
unchanged.
Hit Dice: Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.
Armor Class: A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base
creature’s natural armor bonus, whichever is better.
Attack: A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round.
If the base creature can use weapons, the lich retains this ability. A
creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A
lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its
primary natural weapon (if it has any). A lich armed with a
weapon uses its touch or a weapon, as it desires.
Full Attack: A lich fighting without weapons uses either its
touch attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If
armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary
attack along with a touch as a natural secondary attack, provided it
has a way to make that attack (either a free hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a secondary attack).
Damage: A lich without natural weapons has a touch attack
that uses negative energy to deal 1d8+5 points of damage to living
creatures; a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 lich’s HD + lich’s Cha modifier)
halves the damage. A lich with natural weapons can use its touch
attack or its natural weaponry, as it prefers. If it chooses the latter,
it deals 1d8+5 points of extra damage on one natural weapon
attack.
Special Attacks: A lich retains all the base creature’s
special attacks and gains those described below.
Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich’s HD + lich’s
Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.
Fear Aura (Su): Liches are shrouded in a dreadful
aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5
HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the
lich must succeed on a Will save or be
affected as though by a fear spell
from a sorcerer of the lich’s
level. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
again by the same lich’s aura
for 24 hours.
Paralyzing Touch (Su):
Any living creature a lich hits
with its touch attack must succeed
on a Fortitude save or be permanently
paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell
that can remove a curse can free the
victim (see the bestow curse spell description, page 203 of the Player’s Handbook).
The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone
paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a
DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check
reveals that the victim is still alive..
Spells: A lich can cast any spells it
could cast while alive.
Special Qualities: A lich retains all
the base creature’s special qualities and
gains those described below.
Turn Resistance (Ex): A lich has +4
turn resistance.
Damage Reduction (Su): A lich’s
undead body is tough, giving the creature damage reduction 15/bludgeoning
and magic. Its natural weapons are
treated as magic weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.
Immunities (Ex): Liches have immunity to cold, electricity,
polymorph (though they can use polymorph effects on themselves), and mind-affecting attacks.
Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2,
Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score.
Skills: Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same
as the base creature.
Organization: Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2–4 vampires_
and 5–8 vampire spawn).
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature + 2.
Treasure: Standard coins; double goods; double items.
Alignment: Any evil.
Advancement: By character class.
Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +4.
LICH CHARACTERS
The process of becoming a lich is unspeakably evil and can be
undertaken only by a willing character. A lich retains all class abilities it had in life.
THE LICH’S PHYLACTERY
An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a magic phylactery
in which the character stores its life force. As a rule, the
only way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its
phylactery. Unless its phylactery is located
and destroyed, a lich reappears 1d10 days
after its apparent death.
Each lich must make its own phylactery, which requires the Craft
Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast spells and
have a caster level of 11th or
higher. The phylactery costs
120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to
create and has a caster level
equal to that of its creator at
the time of creation.
The most common form
of phylactery is a sealed
metal box containing
strips of parchment on
which magical phrases
have been transcribed.
The box is Tiny and has 40
hit points, hardness 20,
and a break DC of 40.
Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings,
amulets, or similar items.

The creature looks like a female human or elf with the lower torso of a
multicolored serpent and huge, strikingly patterned wings like a bird’s.
Lillends are mysterious visitors from the plane of Ysgard. Many
are skilled in one or more forms of artistic expression.
Lillends are lovers of music and art. Gold, even food, means
little to them, while a song, story, or piece of artwork holds great
value. The destruction of art and the ill treatment of artists
enrages them. They are infamous for holding grudges, and
they are often encountered seeking violent retribution against enemies of their favorite arts.
Lillends also have a great love of
unspoiled wilderness. The wilds remind
them of the natural beauty of their home
plane, and they occasionally visit and enjoy
similar regions. A lillend
is as protective of its chosen
wilderness as it is of the arts.
These beings sometimes form
temporary alliances with rangers,
druids, and bards to defend their
favorite retreats against the encroachment of civilization. Sometimes a covey
of lillends adopts a tract of wilderness,
using any means necessary to drive off
despoilers.
A typical lillend’s coils are 20 feet long.
The creature weighs about 3,800 pounds. A
few lillends have male torsos.
Lillends speak Celestial, Infernal,
Abyssal, and Common.
COMBAT
Lillends are generally peaceful unless
they intend vengeance against someone they believe guilty of harming,
or even threatening, a favored art
form, artwork, or artist. Then they
become implacable foes. They use
their spells and spell-like abilities to
confuse and weaken opponents before
entering combat. A covey of lillends
usually discusses strategy before a
battle.
A lillend’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Constrict (Ex): A lillend deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a
successful grapple check. Constricting uses the entire lower portion of its body, so it cannot take any move actions when constricting, though it can still attack with its sword.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a lillend must hit with
its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Spells: A lillend casts arcane spells as a 6th-level bard.
Typical Bard Spells Known (3/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level): 0—
dancing lights, daze, detect magic, lullaby, mage hand, read magic; 1st—
charm person, cure light wounds, identify, sleep; 2nd—hold person, invisibility, sound burst.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—darkness, hallucinatory terrain (DC
18), knock, light; 1/day—charm person (DC 15), speak with animals,
speak with plants. Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charismabased.
A lillend also has the bardic music ability as a 6th-level bard.
Skills: Lillends have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks.

This tall humanoid looks
like a cross between a
powerfully built human and a
lizard. It has clawed hands, a
long tail, and toothy jaws.
Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that can be very dangerous if provoked.
Although they are omnivores, lizardfolk prefer meat; popular
lore holds that lizardfolk prefer humanoid flesh, but this charge is
largely unfounded (though some tribes do eat captives or slain
foes). Some more advanced tribes build huts and use a variety of
weapons and shields; leaders of these tribes may have equipment
stolen from or obtained in trade with other intelligent creatures.
A lizardfolk is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or brown
scales. Its tail is used for balance and is 3 to 4 feet long. A lizardfolk
can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds.
Lizardfolk speak Draconic.
COMBAT
Lizardfolk fight as unorganized individuals. They prefer frontal
assaults and massed rushes, sometimes trying to force foes into the
water, where the lizardfolk have an advantage. If outnumbered or if
their territory is being invaded, they set snares, plan ambushes, and
make raids to hinder enemy supplies. Advanced tribes use more
sophisticated tactics and have better traps and ambushes.
Hold Breath: A lizardfolk can hold its breath for a number of
rounds equal to four times its Constitution score before it risks
drowning (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).
Skills: Because of their tails, lizardfolk have a +4 racial bonus on
Jump, Swim, and Balance checks. The skill modifiers given in the
statistics block include a –2 armor check penalty (–4 on Swim
checks) for carrying a heavy shield.
LIZARDFOLK SOCIETY
Lizardfolk have a patriarchal society in which the most powerful
member rules the others. Shamans offer advice but rarely become
leaders themselves. Survival is the utmost concern of lizardfolk, and
a threatened or starving tribe will go to incredible lengths (even
committing deeds considered abominable by other humanoids) to
ensure its continued existence.
Most tribes live in swamps, but about a third of the population
lives in underwater air-filled caves. Local tribes often unite against
a greater threat (including hostile lizardfolk tribes) and occasionally make alliances with locathahs or serve more powerful creatures such as nagas or dragons. In isolated areas
they survive by fishing, gathering, and scavenging,
while those that live near other humanoids make
raids for food, supplies, and slaves. A lizardfolk lair
has half as many noncombatant hatchlings as
adults, and one egg per ten adults.
The patron deity of lizardfolk is Semuanya, whose
chief concern is the survival and propagation of its
charges.
LIZARDFOLK AS CHARACTERS
Most lizardfolk leaders are barbarians or druids.
Lizardfolk clerics (shamans) worship Semuanya.
A lizardfolk clertic has access to two of the following domains: Animal, Plant, or Water.
Lizardfolk characters possess the following
racial traits.
— +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, –2
Intelligence.

—A lizardfolk’s base land
speed is 30 feet.

—Racial Skills: A lizardfolk’s humanoid levels give it skill
points equal to 5 × (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1). Its class skills
are Balance, Jump, and Swim. Lizardfolk have a +4 racial bonus on
Balance, Jump, and Swim checks.

proficient with simple weapons and shields.
— +5 natural armor bonus.

This humanoid is slender and a little shorter than a
human. It has fine, yellow-green scales and large fins
on its arms and legs.
The nomadic locathahs dwell in
warm coastal waters, hunting fish
and gathering crustaceans for
food. Although humanoid in
shape, they are clearly more fish
than human.
Locathahs are not particularly aggressive but do
not trust surface dwellers—far
too many of their kind have been
swept up in fishing nets.
The average locathah stands 5 feet
tall and weighs 175 pounds. Females
and males look very much alike, although the former can be recognized
by the two ochre stripes marking their
egg sacs.
Locathahs speak Aquan.
COMBAT
Any battle with locathahs usually begins
with the creatures loosing volleys
of bolts from their crossbows;
underwater, their crossbows have a range increment of 20 feet. If they
have managed to set up an
ambush or other trap, they continue to employ crossbows for as long as possible. Otherwise, they close to bring their longspears into play.
Although primarily used for fishing, these spears make formidable weapons.
Locathahs lack teeth, claws, and other natural weapons, so they
are not especially dangerous if unarmed. A weaponless locathah
will generally turn and flee.
Skills: A locathah has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.
LOCATHAH SOCIETY
Locathah tribes usually move with each change of season, going
where they can find food. They make their encampments in caves,
rocky areas, or seaweed beds—locales that afford some concealment and protection. Patrols are usually hunting parties after
small game, but they also keep a lookout for enemies trespassing
in the tribe’s hunting area. Larger patrols of locathah are sometimes found tracking big animals or engaged in similar activities.
Entire tribes come together to trade or hold council.
Locathahs revere the deity Eadro, who created both them and
the merfolk.
LOCATHAH CHARACTERS
A locathah’s favored class is barbarian, and most locathah leaders
are barbarians. Most locathah spellcasters are adepts. Locathah
clerics worship Eadro. A locathah cleric has access to two of the
following domains: Animal, Protection, or Water.
LYCANTHROPE
Lycanthropes are humanoids or giants who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like
any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and
those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to have or
acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms, such as
thick, shaggy hair, pointed teeth, or long, strong fingers. In
animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its
eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint
spark of unnatural intelligence.
Evil lycanthropes often hide among normal folk,
emerging in animal form at night (especially under a
full moon) to spread terror and bloodshed. Good
lycanthropes tend to be reclusive individuals, uncomfortable around large numbers of people. They often
live alone in wilderness areas, far from villages and
towns.
Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease. Sometimes a lycanthrope begins life as a normal
humanoid or giant who subsequently contracts lycanthropy after being wounded by
a lycanthrope. Such a creature is called an
afflicted lycanthrope. Other lycanthropes
are born as lycanthropes, and are known as
natural lycanthropes.
Combat
A lycanthrope in its humanoid (or giant)
form uses whatever tactics and
weapons are favored by others of
its kind, though it tends to be
slightly more aggressive. A lycanthrope possesses the senses of its animal
form, including scent and low-light vision,
and it has a deep empathy for (and ability to communicate with) animals of its animal form. An afflicted lycanthrope
damaged in combat may be overwhelmed by rage, causing it to
change to its animal form involuntarily.
A lycanthrope in animal form fights like the animal it resembles, although its bite carries the disease of lycanthropy. It is
preternaturally cunning and strong, and possesses damage reduction that is overcome only by silvered weapons.
Finally, a natural lycanthrope (or an afflicted lycanthrope that
has become aware of its affliction) can assume a hybrid form that
is a mix of its humanoid and animal forms. A hybrid has hands and
can use weapons, but it can also attack with its teeth and claws. A
hybrid can spread lycanthropy with its bite, and it has the same
damage reduction that its animal form possesses.
WEREBEAR
This hulking humanoid is covered in shaggy brown fur and has long claws
and a bearlike face. It carries a greataxe in one paw.
LYCANTHROPE
Locathah
170
Werebears in humanoid form tend to be stout, well-muscled, and
hairy. Their brown hair is thick, and males usually wear beards.
They may have reddish, blond, ivory, or black hair, matching the
color of the ursine form. They dress in simple cloth and leather
garments that are easy to remove, repair, or replace. In their
animal form, werebears are moody and grumpy. They desire only
their own company and seek out evil creatures to slay.
Combat
Werebears fight just as brown bears do in animal form. In humanoid or hybrid form, they favor large, heavy weapons such as
greataxes or greatswords. The werebear’s greataxe is a Medium
weapon, so it can wield the axe in one hand in hybrid form.
Alternate Form (Su): A werebear can assume the form of a
brown bear or a bear-humanoid hybrid.
Bear Empathy (Ex): Communicate with bears and dire bears,
and +4 racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against bears and
dire bears.

werebear’s bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a
DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a werebear must be in
bear form and must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start
a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

bear form.

Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.
WEREBOAR
Stocky and powerful, this fierce humanoid is covered in short, stiff fur and
has boarlike tusks.
A wereboar in humanoid form tends to be a stocky, muscular individual of average height. It dresses in simple garments that are
easy to remove, repair, or replace.
Combat
In any form, wereboars are as ferocious as normal boars. When in
hybrid form, they fight with a weapon and their dangerous gore
attack.
Alternate Form (Su): A wereboar can assume the form of a
boar or a boar-humanoid hybrid.
Boar Empathy (Ex): Communicate with boars and dire boars,
and +4 racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against boars and
dire boars.
Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid or giant hit by the

Dire wereboars in giant form look much like normal hill giants,
though slightly stockier, and with coarser, stiffer hair and stiff.
The dire wereboar described here is based on a hill giant and natural lycanthrope with normal ability scores for a hill giant.
Combat
Dire wereboars anger quickly. They usually begin a battle in giant
form, then switch to hybrid form to take advantage of their immense strength in that shape. They like to use their Improved Bull
Rush and Improved Sunder feats to shove opponents around and
smash their weapons and shields.
Alternate Form (Su): A dire wereboar can assume a bipedal
hybrid form or the form of a dire boar.
Boar Empathy (Ex): Communicate with boars and dire boars,
and +4 racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against boars and
dire boars.
Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid or giant hit by a
dire wereboar’s bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed
on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.
Ferocity (Ex): A dire wereboar is such a tenacious combatant that
it continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.
CREATING A LYCANTHROPE
“Lycanthrope” is a template that can be added to any humanoid or
giant (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The lycanthrope
template can be inherited (for natural lycanthropes) or acquired (for
afflicted lycanthropes). Becoming a lycanthrope is very much like
multiclassing as an animal and gaining the appropriate Hit Dice.
Size and Type: The base creature’s type does not change, but the
creature gains the shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on
the characteristics of some type of carnivorous or omnivorous creature of the animal type (referred to hereafter as the base animal).
This animal can be any predator, scavenger, or omnivore whose
size is within one size category of the base creature’s size (Small,
Medium, or Large for a Medium base creature). Lycanthropes can
also adopt a hybrid shape that combines features of the base creature and the base animal. A lycanthrope’s hybrid form is the same
size as the base animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.
A lycanthrope uses either the base creature’s or the base animal’s
statistics and special abilities in addition to those described here.
Hit Dice and Hit Points: Same as the base creature plus those
of the base animal. To calculate total hit points, apply Constitution
modifiers according to the score the lycanthrope has in each form.
For example, a human commoner with a Constitution score of 11
as a human and a Constitution score of 15 as a wolf has 1d4 plus
2d8+4 hit points.
Speed: Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on
which form the lycanthrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature’s speed.
Armor Class: The base creature’s natural armor bonus increases
by +2 in all forms. In hybrid form, the lycanthrope’s natural armor
bonus is equal to the natural armor bonus of the base animal or the
base creature, whichever is better.
Base Attack/Grapple: Add the base attack bonus for the base
animal to the base attack bonus for the base creature. The lycanthrope’s grapple bonus uses its attack bonus and modifiers for
Strength and size depending on the lycanthrope’s form.
Attacks: Same as the base creature or base animal, depending
on which form the lycanthrope is using. A lycanthrope in hybrid
form gains two claw attacks and a bite attack as natural weapons.
These weapons deal damage based on the hybrid form’s size. A hybrid may attack with a weapon and a bite, or may attack with its
natural weapons. The bite attack of a hybrid is a secondary attack.

Medium 1d4 1d6
Large 1d6 1d8

Damage: Same as the base creature or base animal, depending
on which form the lycanthrope is in.
Special Attacks: A lycanthrope retains the special attacks of
the base creature or base animal, depending on which form it is
using, and also gains the special attacks described below.
A lycanthrope’s hybrid form does not gain any special attacks of
the base animal. A lycanthrope spellcaster cannot cast spells with
verbal, somatic, or material components while in animal form, or
spells with verbal components while in hybrid form.
Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): Any humanoid or giant hit by a natural
lycanthrope’s bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed
on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy. If the victim’s
size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope (for
example, a hill giant bitten by a wererat), the victim cannot contract lycanthropy from that lycanthrope. Afflicted lycanthropes
cannot pass on the curse of lycanthropy.
Special Qualities: A lycanthrope retains all the special qualities of the base creature and the base animal, and also gains those
described below.
Alternate Form (Su): A lycanthrope can shift into animal form as
though using the polymorph spell on itself, though its gear is not
affected, it does not regain hit points for changing form, and only
the specific animal form indicated for the lycanthrope can be
assumed. It does not assume the ability scores of the animal, but
instead adds the animal’s physical ability score modifiers to its
own ability scores. A lycanthrope also can assume a bipedal hybrid
form with prehensile hands and animalistic features.
Changing to or from animal or hybrid form is a standard action.
A slain lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it
remains dead. Separated body parts retain their animal form, however. Afflicted lycanthropes find this ability difficult to control

LYCANTHOPE
177
(see Lycanthropy as an Affliction, below), but natural lycanthropes
have full control over this power.
Damage Reduction (Ex): An afflicted lycanthrope in animal or
hybrid form has damage reduction 5/silver. A natural lycanthrope
in animal or hybrid form has damage reduction 10/silver.
Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex): In any form, lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with normal or dire animals of their
animal form. This gives them a +4 racial bonus on checks when
influencing the animal’s attitude and allows the communication
of simple concepts and (if the animal is friendly) commands, such
as “friend,” “foe,” “flee,” and “attack.”
Low-Light Vision (Ex): A lycanthrope has low-light vision in any
form.
Scent (Ex): A lycanthrope has the scent ability in any form.
Base Save Bonuses: Add the base save bonuses of the base
animal to the base save bonuses of the base creature.
Abilities: All lycanthropes gain +2 to Wisdom. In addition,
when in animal form, a lycanthrope’s physical ability scores
improve according to its kind, as set out in the table below. These
adjustments are equal to the animal’s normal ability scores –10 or
–11. For example, a werecrocodile (Str 19, Dex 12, Con 17) would
add Str +8, Dex +2, and Con +6 to its normal ability scores when it
takes crocodile form. A lycanthrope in hybrid form modifies its
physical ability scores by the same amount.
In addition, a lycanthrope may also gain an additional ability
score increase by virtue of its extra Hit Dice.
Skills: A lycanthrope gains skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier,
minimum 1) per Hit Die of its animal form, as if it had multiclassed
into the animal type. (Animal is never its first Hit Die, though, and
it does not gain quadruple skill points for any animal Hit Die.) Any
skill given in the animal’s description is a class skill for the lycanthrope’s animal levels. In any form, a lycanthrope also has any racial
skill bonuses of the base creature and of the base animal, although
conditional skill bonuses, such as a weretiger’s camouflage bonus
on Hide checks, only apply in the associated form.
Feats: Add the base animal’s feats to the base creature’s. If this
results in a lycanthrope having the same feat twice, the lycanthrope
gains no additional benefit unless the feat normally can be taken
more once, in which case the duplicated feat works as noted in the
feat description. This process may give the lycanthrope more feats
than a character of its total Hit Dice would normally be entitled to;
if this occurs, any “extra” feats are denoted as bonus feats.
It’s possible that a lycanthrope cannot meet the prerequisites for
all its feats when in humanoid form. If this occurs, the lycanthrope still has the feats, but cannot use them when in humanoid
form. A lycanthrope receives Iron Will as a bonus feat.
Environment: Same as either the base creature or base animal.
Organization: Solitary or pair, sometimes family (3–4), pack
(6–10), or troupe (family plus related animals)

LYCANTHROPY AS AN AFFLICTION
When a character contracts lycanthropy through a lycanthrope’s
bite (see above), no symptoms appear until the first night of the
next full moon. On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily
assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity, temporarily becoming an NPC under the DM’s control. The character
remains in animal form, assuming the appropriate alignment,
until the next dawn.
The character’s actions during this first episode are dictated by
the alignment of its animal form. Good-aligned lycanthropes seek
to avoid settlements or travelers and nonnatural environments,
seeking out wilderness environs. They may hunt the natural prey
of their kind, but avoid attacking good and neutral intelligent creatures. Evil-aligned lycanthropes seek to murder as many intelligent
creatures as possible, often killing their own family members and
friends. They generally seek out places where such victims may be
found. Neutral creatures seek remote areas and avoid contact with
civilization, but might attack travelers or other folk abroad in the
wilderness if the travelers are few in number. However, the attack
is driven by natural ferocity and hunger, not malice. In any case,
the character remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom check, in
which case he becomes aware of his lycanthropic condition.
Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in combat. He or
she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on
a Control Shape check (see page 303) to resist changing into
animal form. Any player character not yet aware of his or her
lycanthropic condition temporarily becomes an NPC under the
DM’s control during an involuntary change, and acts as described
above depending on the alignment of his or her animal form.
A character with awareness of his condition retains his identity
and does not lose control of his actions if he changes. However,
each time he changes to his animal form, he must make a Will
save (DC 15 + number of times he has been in animal form) or
permanently assume the alignment of his animal form in all
shapes. An evil lycanthrope who is aware of his actions in animal
form is not compelled to murder and kill indiscriminately, but he
delights in bloodshed and will certainly seek out opportunities to
slaughter intelligent beings, preferably those of his own race.
Once a character becomes aware of his affliction, he can now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid form, using the
appropriate Control Shape check DC (see page 303). An attempt is a
standard action and can be made each round. Any voluntary change
to animal or hybrid form immediately and permanently changes
the character’s alignment to that of the appropriate lycanthrope.
Changing Form
Changing form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary, the
character performs the change on his next turn following the triggering event. Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the character’s armor and clothing (including any items worn) if the new form
is larger than the character’s natural form; carried items are simply
dropped. Characters can hastily doff clothing while changing, but
not armor. Magic armor survives the change if it succeeds on a DC
15 Fortitude save. An afflicted character who is not aware of his condition remains in animal form until the next dawn. An afflicted
character who is aware of his or her condition (see above) can try to
resume humanoid form following a change (voluntary or involuntary) with a Control Shape check, but if he fails his check, he
remains in animal (or hybrid) form until the following dawn.
Curing Lycanthropy
An afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called
wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a lycanthrope’s attack can attempt a
DC 20 Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer administers the herb, use the character’s save bonus or the healer’s Heal
modifier, whichever is higher. The character gets only one chance,
no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna
must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).
However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must
succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength
damage. One minute later, the character must succeed on a second
DC 13 save or take an additional 2d6 points of Strength damage.
A remove disease or heal spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or
higher also cures the affliction, provided the character receives the
spell within three days of the lycanthrope’s attack.
The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast remove
curse or break enchantment on the character during one of the three
days of the full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must
succeed on a DC 20 Will save to break the curse (the caster knows
if the spell works). If the save fails, the process must be repeated.
Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined
in cages until the cure takes effect.
Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.
LYCANTHROPES AS CHARACTERS
Since they live in the wilderness, most lycanthropes become barbarians or rangers. Wererats tend to become rogues. Becoming a
lycanthrope does not change a character’s favored class but usually
changes alignment (see above). This alignment change may cause
characters of certain classes to lose some of their class features, as
noted in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook.
Lycanthrope characters possess the following racial traits.
— +2 Wisdom. Physical abilities are increased by the animal
form’s ability modifiers when a lycanthrope changes to its hybrid
or animal forms.
—Size same as the base creature or the base animal form.
—Low-light vision in any form.
—Scent in any form.
—Racial Hit Dice: A lycanthrope adds the Hit Dice of its animal
form to its base Hit Dice for race, level, and class. These additional
Hit Dice modify the lycanthrope’s base attack bonus and base
saving throw bonuses accordingly.
—Racial Skills: A lycanthrope adds skill points for its animal
Hit Dice much as if it had multiclassed into the animal type. It
gains skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die of the animal form. Any skills that appear in the animal’s
description are treated as class skills for the lycanthrope’s animal
levels. The lycanthrope’s maximum skill ranks are equal to its
animal form Hit Dice + its racial Hit Dice (if any) + its class levels
+ 3. Any racial skill adjustments of the lycanthrope’s base race and
its animal form (but not conditional adjustments) are added to its
skill modifiers in any form.
LYCANTHROPE

—Racial Feats: Add the animal’s Hit Dice to the base character’s
own Hit Dice to determine how many feats the character has. All
lycanthropes gain Iron Will as a bonus feat.

—Special Qualities (see above): Alternate form, lycanthropic

This glowing, humanoid creature
looks like a stumpy human sculpted
from fire and flowing lava. It radiates heat like a small bonfire, and
it has a gleeful, almost malicious smile on its face.
Magmins are small,
human - shaped
beings from the
Elemental Plane of
Fire that radiate intense
heat and are wreathed in an aura of
searing flames.
Although not evil, these fiery creatures are extremely mischievous. They like to watch things burn, perhaps lacking the ability to
understand that flames are painful or even deadly to other creatures.
A typical magmin is 4 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
Magmins speak Ignan.
COMBAT
Although small, magmins are dangerous opponents. Their touch
is effective against those who lack protection or immunity from
heat and flames, but if faced with opponents who have immunity
to fire, magmins rely on their slam attack. In any case, magmins
are not valiant fighters. They usually flee if injured, although often
only far enough to set up a fiery ambush for their enemies.
A magmin’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Combustion (Ex): Anyone a magmin touches must succeed on
a DC 12 Reflex save or take an extra 1d8 points of fire damage as
clothes ignite or armor becomes searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+2 rounds after the magmin’s last successful
attack. Magmins can also ignite flammable materials with a touch.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Fiery Aura (Ex): Anyone within 20 feet of a magmin must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of heat damage
per round from the intense heat. The save DC is Constitutionbased.
Melt Weapons (Ex): Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin
must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or melt away into slag.
The save DC is Constitution-based.

MANTICORE
Magmin
179
This creature is a monster in every sense of the word. It has the head of a
vaguely humanoid beast, the body of a lion, and the wings of a
dragon. The creature’s back is set
with curved barbs, and its long
tail ends in a cluster of
deadly spikes.
Manticores are fierce creatures that hunt widely for living flesh. They are
cunning and evil. A manticore can be a deadly
enemy or a powerful ally.
A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and
weighs about 1,000 pounds.
Manticores speak Common.
COMBAT
A manticore begins most attacks with a volley of spikes, then
closes. In the outdoors, it often uses its powerful wings to stay
aloft during battle.
Spikes (Ex): With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a
volley of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for
each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature
can launch only twenty-four spikes in any 24-hour period.
Skills: *Manticores have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

Though at first glance this creature
appeared to be a well-proportioned
human, a closer look reveals a
hideous face crowned with a
mass of writhing, hissing
snakes instead of hair, eyes
glowing a deep, feral red,
and scaly, earth-colored
skin.
The medusa is a
hateful, repulsive
creature that
petrifies living
beings with its
gaze. It prizes
art objects, fine
jewelry, and wealth. Its activities
often revolve around obtaining these
items.
A medusa is indistinguishable from a normal human at distances greater than 30 feet (or closer, if its face is concealed). The
creature often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding
its face behind a hood or veil.
Medusas are found in nearly every climate. Some dwell in large
cities, becoming active in the criminal underworld to gain their
desires. A few medusas have formed robbery rings or organized
smuggling cabals.
A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as
a human.
Medusas speak Common.
COMBAT
A medusa tries to disguise its true nature until the intended victim
is within range of its petrifying gaze, using subterfuge and bluffing games to convince the target that there is no danger. It uses
normal weapons to attack those who avert their eyes or survive its
gaze, while its poisonous snakes strike at adjacent opponents.
Petrifying Gaze (Su): Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.
MEPHIT
Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes. They are
more curious than evil, though each individual’s nature varies
depending on the essence of the element that birthed it.
All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less
humanoid features. While they are often described as impish,
their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.
COMBAT
All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon,
the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.
A mephit’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Breath Weapon (Su): A mephit can use its breath weapon once
every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.

MEPHIT

Spell-Like Abilities: All mephits have one or more spell-like
abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions
for details.
Summon Mephit (Sp): Once per day, a mephit can attempt to
summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a summon monster spell, but with only a 25% chance of success.
Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A
mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon
ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Fast Healing (Ex): Mephits heal 2 points of damage each
round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions
are met. See the individual descriptions for details.
MEPHIT GANGS AND MOBS
Groups of similar mephits (for example,
water, ooze, and ice) sometimes congregate

This winged creature looks like a
miniature fish-person. It is covered
with scales and views the world
through black, bulbous eyes.
Water mephits come from the
Elemental Plane of Water.
Water mephits are jaunty
creatures with an unflagging
sense of humor who quickly get
on the nerves of everyone around
them. Each one is about 4 feet tall
and weighs about 30 pounds.
Water mephits speak Common and
Aquan.
Combat
Breath Weapon (Su): 15-foot cone of caustic
liquid, damage 1d8 acid, Reflex DC 13 half. The save
DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
Spell-Like Abilities: Once per hour a water mephit can
hurl an acidic blob that functions like Melf ’s acid arrow (caster level
3rd). Once per day it can create a mass of smelly fog that duplicates the effect of a stinking cloud spell (DC 15, caster level 6th).
The save DC is Charisma-based.
Fast Healing (Ex): A water mephit heals only if it is exposed to
rain or submerged up to its waist in water.
Skills: A water mephit has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.

This being has the upper body, arms, and head of
a fair-featured human. Instead of legs, however, it
has the scaled tail of a great fish.
The merfolk are playful, marinedwelling people. Although wary of
surface dwellers, they are not usually hostile: They prefer sunning
themselves on rocks to engaging
in warfare.
Both male and female merfolk
decorate themselves with shells,
coral, and other underwater adornments.
Adventurers who encounter
merfolk are often the victims of
pranks and mischief. The sport of
merfolk can be cruel, although they
are not actually evil. Should surface
dwellers do them harm, however, these
creatures can be formidable enemies.
A merfolk is about 8 feet long from the top of the
head to the end of the tail, and weighs about 400 pounds.
Merfolk speak Common and Aquan.
Most merfolk encountered outside their home are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.
COMBAT
Merfolk favor heavy crossbows of shell and coral that fire bolts
fashioned from blowfish spines, with an underwater range increment of 30 feet. Merfolk often barrage their enemies before closing, when they resort to tridents.

MERFOLK SOCIETY
Merfolk live in semipermanent communities located near choice
fishing and hunting areas. They often keep company with porpoises. Surface dwellers who come face to face with merfolk commonly encounter a scouting or hunting patrol.
The merfolk revere the deity Eadro, who created both them and
the locathahs.
MERFOLK CHARACTERS
A merfolk’s favored class is bard; most merfolk leaders are bards.
Merfolk spellcasters who are not bards are generally adepts. Merfolk clerics worship Eadro. A merfolk cleric has access to two of
the following domains: Animal, Protection, or Water.

What originally appeared to be
an object now shows signs of
organic life as the creature
sprouts a lashing pseudopod.
The mimic is a strange and
deadly creature that can
change its pigmentation
and shape. It uses this ability to
lure hapless victims close enough to
slay them.
It is said that mimics are not natural creatures but were created
long ago by a now-forgotten wizard. Ever since, these terrible
things have served to guard treasures.
A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not
more than 10 feet long. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic
feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 4,500 pounds.
Mimics speak Common.
COMBAT
A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out
with a heavy pseudopod. The creature does not necessarily fight to
the death if it can succeed in extorting treasure or food from a
party.
Adhesive (Ex): A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a
powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that
touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples
any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled
cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the
adhesive first.
A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast
unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A successful
DC 16 Strength check is needed to pry it off.
Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can
grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and
the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.
Crush (Ex): A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.
Mimic Shape (Ex): A mimic can assume the general shape of
any object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6
feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame.
The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s
body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it
might present. Anyone who examines the mimic can detect the
ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by the mimic’s Disguise
check. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late.
Skills: A mimic has a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks.
MIND FLAYER
This strange humanoid-shaped being stands about as tall as a human. Its
flesh is rubbery and greenish-mauve, glistening with slime. The creature’s
head looks rather like a four-tentacled octopus, made all the more horrible by a pair of bloated white eyes.
Mind flayers, also called illithids, are so insidious, diabolical, and
powerful that all denizens of the dark fear them. They bend others
to their will and shatter enemies’ minds.
A mind flayer’s mouth, a revolting thing shaped like a
lamprey’s maw, constantly drips an oily slime when it is
not siphoning out the brains of living prey.
In addition to being highly intelligent, wholly evil, and terribly
sadistic, mind flayers are
utterly self-serving. If an
encounter turns against the
creature, it flees at once,
caring nothing for the
fate of its companions or
servitors.
A mind flayer is about
the same height and
weight as a human.
Mind flayers speak Undercommon but prefer to communicate telepathically.

MINDFLAYER
Illus. by T. Lockwood
Mindflayer
187
COMBAT
Mind flayers like to fight from a distance,
using their psionic abilities, particularly
mind blast. If pressed into melee combat, a
mind flayer lashes its enemies with the
tentacles ringing its mouth.
Mind Blast (Sp): This psionic attack
is a cone 60 feet long. Anyone caught in
this cone must succeed on a DC 17 Will
save or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. Mind
flayers often hunt using this power and
then drag off one or two of their
stunned victims to feed upon. The
save DC is Charisma-based. This
ability is the equivalent of a 4thlevel spell.
Psionics (Sp): At will—charm
monster (DC 17), detect thoughts (DC
15), levitate, plane shift, suggestion (DC
16). Effective caster level 8th. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use
this ability, a mind flayer must hit a
Small, Medium, or Large creature
with its tentacle attack. It can
then attempt to start a grapple
as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and attaches
the tentacle to the opponent’s
head. A mind flayer can grab
a Huge or larger creature, but
only if it can somehow reach the foe’s head.
If a mind flayer begins its turn with at least
one tentacle attached, it can try to attach its
remaining tentacles with a single grapple check.
The opponent can escape with a single successful
grapple check or an Escape Artist check, but the
mind flayer gets a +2 circumstance bonus for
every tentacle that was attached at the beginning
of the opponent’s turn.
Extract (Ex): A mind flayer that begins
its turn with all four tentacles attached
and that makes a successful grapple
check automatically extracts the opponent’s
brain, instantly killing that creature. This
power is useless against constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. It is not
instantly fatal to foes with multiple heads, such
as ettins and hydras.
MIND FLAYER SORCERER
While many mind flayers train as wizards and
grow mighty in the arcane arts along that
disciplined path, some of the most fearsome of the illithids are sorcerers, whose
mastery of magic seems almost instinctual.
Combat
The save DCs for this mind flayer sorcerer’s
mind blast (DC 21) and its psionics (charm monster DC 21, detect thoughts DC 19, suggestion DC

MIND FLAYER
SOCIETY
Mind flayers congregate in
underground cities of 200 to
2,000 inhabitants, plus at least
two slaves for each resident.
Slaves obey their masters without question. The center of a community is
its elder brain, a pool of briny fluid that
contains the brains of the city’s deceased
mind flayers.
Although they constantly vie for power,
mind flayers are quite willing to work
together. A small group of these creatures,
known as an inquisition, often forms to root
out some dark and terrible secret. In
many ways, a mind flayer inquisition is not unlike a party of adventurers, with each member contributing its own skills and
knowledge to the group.
When a task is too great
for an inquisition to handle,
mind flayers generally form a
cult. A pair of illithids commands
the group, each struggling for
supremacy.

Tactics Round-by-Round
A mind flayer is most effective as a ranged combatant, using its
spell-like abilities to attack from a distance.
Prior to combat: Use detect thoughts to scout foes and determine threat
potential. (Highly intelligent creatures are considered most dangerous; creatures of lower intelligence are potential pawns and food.)
Round 1: Mind blast.
Round 2: If most of the party is stunned, use charm
monster on a remaining foe. If most of the party is
not stunned, maintain distance and use mind
blast again.
Round 3: If fewer than two foes remain unstunned, order any charmed foes to protect
you. Grapple a stunned foe with tentacles.
If a majority of the party remains unstunned, flee using levitate or, if necessary, plane shift.
Round 4: If still in a position of strength, start eating
brains. Use charmed foes to guard you. If in a position of
weakness, use plane shift, perhaps with grappled foe.
A mind flayer works well as a “boss monster.” If
it has minions, it varies its tactics to suit the
situation, as follows.
Prior to combat: Dispatch minions with orders to assault foes from
one side of the battlefield. Use levitate
and cover to take a safe command position, preferably out of obvious sight.
Round 1: Order minions into optimal
positions using telepathy. If the opportunity presents itself, use mind blast on
foes (without hitting minions if possible—but
they’re all expendable). If the battlefield is too
congested, use charm monster or suggestion to
sow confusion in foes.
Round 2: Identify enemy spellcasters and
order minions telepathically to assault
them at all costs. Focus spell-like abilities
on lesser foes.
Round 3: Order charmed foes toward
you (telepathically). Grapple them.
Have minions keep uncharmed,
unstunned foes busy.
Round 4: Eat brains.

Advancement:
By character class
Level Adjustment: +2
The creature looks like an
incredibly tall, powerfully
muscled human, covered in
shaggy fur, with the head of a
bull. The dark eyes of the
brute gleam with savage
fury.
Minotaurs are strong,
fiercely territorial creatures often found in
vast underground
labyrinths.
A minotaur’s
natural cunning
and feral instincts
enable it to find its
way easily through
even the most confusing tunnel complexes
—an ability it puts to
great use in hunting, tormenting, and ultimately
destroying intruders.
A minotaur stands more than 7
feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.
Minotaurs speak Giant.
COMBAT
Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength
serves them well.
Powerful Charge (Ex): A minotaur typically begins a
battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to
bring its mighty horns into play. In addition to the
normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this
allows the beast to make a single gore attack
with a +9 attack bonus that deals 4d6+6 points
of damage.
Natural Cunning (Ex): Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This
gives them immunity to maze spells, prevents
them from ever becoming lost, and enables
them to track enemies. Further, they are
never caught flat-footed.
Skills: Minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus
on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.

—Space/Reach: 10 feet/10 feet.
—A minotaur’s base land speed is 30 feet.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Racial Hit Dice: A minotaur begins with six levels of monstrous humanoid, which provide 6d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus

This creature looks like a gaunt, nearly skeletal
corpse, its rib cage filled with horrid, writhing viscera.
The creature’s tongue is its most noteworthy
feature—long, cartilaginous, and clawed.
Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains who died without
atoning for their crimes. Tortured by an allconsuming hatred of living things, they
long to live again.
Most mohrgs are 5 to 6 feet tall and
weigh about 120 pounds.
MUMMY
Mummy
190
COMBAT
Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their
fists. They often catch opponents flat-footed, for they move much
faster than zombies.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a
creature of its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity.
Paralyzing Touch (Su): A mohrg lashes out with its
tongue in combat. An opponent the tongue touches
must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charismabased.
Create Spawn (Su): Creatures killed by a mohrg
rise after 1d4 days as zombies under the morhg’s
control. They do not possess any of the abilities
they had in life.
MUMMY
This creature looks like a withered and desiccated
corpse, with features hidden beneath centuries-old
funereal wrappings. It moves with a slow, shambling gait and groans with the weight of the
ages.
Mummies are preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark
desert gods best forgotten. They usually
inhabit great tombs or temple complexes,
maintaining a timeless vigil and destroying
would-be grave robbers.
These horrid creatures are often marked
with symbols of the dire gods they serve.
While other undead often stink of carrion, the herbs and powders
used to create a mummy give off a sharp, pungent odor like that of
a spice cabinet.
Mummies attack intruders without pause or mercy. They never
attempt to communicate with their enemies and never retreat. An
encounter with a mummy can end only with the destruction of
one combatant or the other (unless the mummy’s foe elects to
retreat).
Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.
Mummies can speak Common, but seldom bother to do so.
COMBAT
In melee combat, a mummy delivers a
powerful blow. Even if it had no other
abilities, its great strength and grim determination would make it a formidable
opponent.
Despair (Su): At the mere sight
of a mummy, the viewer must
succeed on a DC 16 Will save or
be paralyzed with fear for 1d4
rounds. Whether or not the save is
successful, that creature cannot be
affected again by the same
mummy’s despair ability for 24
hours. The save DC is Charismabased.
Mummy Rot (Su): Supernatural
disease—slam, Fortitude DC 16,
incubation period 1 minute;
damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The

Unlike normal diseases, mummy
rot continues until the victim reaches

Mummy lord
191
Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature
afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level
check, or the spell has no effect on the afflicted character.
To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with
break enchantment or remove curse (requiring a DC 20 caster level
check for either spell), after which a caster level check is no longer
necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot
can be magically cured as any normal disease.
An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot
shrivels away into sand and dust that blow
away into nothing at the first
wind.
MUMMY LORD
Unusually powerful or evil
individuals preserved as
mummies sometimes
rise as greater mummies
after death. A mummy
lord resembles its lesser
fellows, but often wears
or carries equipment it
used in life—ancient
bronze armor, a runemarked sword, or a magic
staff.
Mummy lords are often
potent spellcasters. They are
found as guardians of the
tombs of high lords,
priests, and mages. Most
are sworn to defend for
eternity the resting place
of those whom they
served in life, but in some
cases a mummy lord’s unliving state is the result of a terrible curse or rite designed to
punish treason, infidelity, or crimes
of an even more abhorrent nature. A
mummy lord of this sort is usually
imprisoned in a tomb that is never
meant to be opened again.
Despair (Su): The save DC against this
mummy lord’s despair is 17.
Mummy Rot (Su): The save DC against this
mummy lord’s mummy rot is 17.

NAGA
Nagas are highly intelligent creatures with a variety of magical
powers. They are natural masters of those around them, using
subtle wards and clever traps to keep intruders from disturbing
their peace.
All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening
scales, and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10
to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are
bright and intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.
COMBAT
Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are
almost always found in the lairs they guard and know well, they
can arrange most encounters to suit their wishes.

Wise and good, guardian
nagas often protect
sacred places or maintain a lookout against
evil deeds.
A guardian naga tends to raise its crest
when it becomes angry.
Guardian nagas speak Celestial and
Common.
Combat
Guardian nagas usually warn
off intruders before attacking.
If the warning is ignored, they
may begin a spell assault or spit
poison.
Poison (Ex): Injury or contact, Fortitude DC 19, initial and secondary damage 1d10 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Spit (Ex): A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a
standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves
(see above) to avoid the effect.
Spells: Guardian nagas cast spells as 9th-level sorcerers, and can
also cast spells from the cleric list and from the Good and Law
domains. The cleric spells and domain spells are considered
arcane spells for a guardian naga, meaning that the creature does
not need a divine focus to cast them.

This being looks like a hideously ugly human woman. Its flesh is the blueviolet of a deep bruise and covered with warts, blisters, and open sores. It
has straggly jet-black hair and jagged, yellow teeth The eyes burn like hot
coals, throwing out a thick, red radiance.
Merciless and utterly evil, night hags are creatures from the plane
of Hades that constantly hunger for the flesh and souls of innocent men and women.
A night hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.
Night hags speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal.
COMBAT
Night hags attack good creatures on sight if the odds of success
seem favorable.
These creatures rip through armor and flesh with their deadly
teeth. They love to use sleep and then strangle those who are overcome by it.
A night hag’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Disease (Ex): Demon fever—bite, Fortitude DC 18, incubation
period 1 day, damage 1d6 Con. Each day after the first, on a failed
save, an afflicted creature must immediately succeed on another
DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution drain. The
save DC is Constitution based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—detect chaos, detect evil, detect good,
detect law, detect magic, magic missile, polymorph (self only), ray of
enfeeblement (DC 12), sleep (DC 12). Caster level 8th. A night hag
can use etherealness at will (caster level 16th) so long as it possesses
its heartstone (see below). The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Dream Haunting (Su): Night hags can visit the dreams of
chaotic or evil individuals by using a special periapt known as a
heartstone to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature.
Once a hag invades someone’s dreams, it rides on the victim’s back
until dawn. The sleeper suffers from tormenting dreams and takes
1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions, by confronting and
defeating the night hag.
HEARTSTONE
All night hags carry a periapt known as a heartstone, which
instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition,
a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws
(this bonus is included in the statistics block). A night hag that
loses this charm can no longer use etherealness until it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than
the hag can benefit from the heartstone’s powers, but the periapt
shatters after ten uses (any disease cured or saving throw affected
counts as a use) and it does not bestow etherealness to a bearer that
is not a night hag. If sold, an intact heartstone brings 1,800 gp.
NIGHTMARE
At first glance, this creature looks like a large, powerful horse with a jetblack coat. A closer look, however, reveals its true nature. Flames wreathe
its steely hooves, trail from its flared nostrils, and smolder in the depths of
its dark eyes.
Nightmares are proud equine creatures with hearts as black and
evil as the dark abysses from which they come. They dwell on the
plane of Hades.
A nightmare is a wild and restless creature. It roams the world
doing evil and haunting the dreams of all who dare cross it.
Although it has no wings, the creature can fly with great speed. It
seldom allows anyone to ride it, but particularly powerful and evil
creatures have been known to make mounts of nightmares.
A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse.
COMBAT
A nightmare does battle by biting with its viperish fangs and kicking with its powerful legs. A nightmare can fight while carrying a
rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless he or she succeeds on
a Ride check.

A nightmare’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Flaming Hooves (Su): A blow from a nightmare’s hooves sets
combustible materials alight.
Smoke (Su): During the
excitement of battle, a
nightmare snorts and
neighs with rage. This
snorting fills a 15-
foot cone with a hot,
sulfurous smoke that
chokes and blinds
opponents. Anyone in
the cone must succeed
on a DC 16 Fortitude save
or take a –2 penalty on all
attack and damage rolls
until 1d6 minutes after
leaving the cone. The
cone lasts 1 round, and the
nightmare uses it once as a free
action during its turn each
round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Because of the smoke it gives off, a
nightmare has concealment against creatures 5
feet away and total concealment against creatures
10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not
obscure the nightmare’s vision at all.
Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su): These abilities
function just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th);
a nightmare can use either at will.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a nightmare is up to 300
pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load,
601–900 pounds.
CAUCHEMAR
The cauchemar is a horrible, especially malevolent version of a
nightmare. The sight of one of these great horrors bearing down is
enough to shake the heart of the boldest champion.
Combat
The save DC for the cauchemar’s smoke attack (DC 24) is
adjusted for its greater number of Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a cauchemar is up to 612
pounds; a medium load, 613–1,224 pounds; and a heavy load,
1,225–1,840 pounds.
NIGHTSHADE
Nightshades are powerful undead composed of equal parts darkness
and absolute evil. Their chilling malevolence hangs heavily about
them, along with the smell of an open grave on a winter’s morning.
Nightshades can read and understand all forms of communication; however, they communicate with others by telepathy.
COMBAT
Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature with unique powers and abilities. Their tactics vary according
to their abilities, but they all make liberal use of haste.
Nightshade Abilities
All nightshades have the following special abilities.
Aversion to Daylight (Ex): Nightshades are creatures of utter
darkness and loathe all light. If exposed to natural daylight (not
merely a daylight spell), they take a –4 penalty on all attack rolls,
saving throws, and skill checks.
Desecrating Aura (Su): All nightshades give off a 20-footradius emanation of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative energy. This ability works much like a desecrate
spell, except that the nightshade’s evil is so great that it is treated as
the shrine of an evil power. All undead within 20 feet of the
nightshade (including the creature itself ) gain a +2 profane
bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and
+2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit Dice, attack, and
save entries given here include these profane
bonuses.) Charisma checks made to turn
undead within this area take a –6
penalty.
A nightshade’s desecrating aura
cannot be dispelled except by a
dispel evil spell or similar
effect. If the effect is dispelled, the nightshade
can resume it as a free
action on its next
turn. Its desecrating
aura is suppressed if a
nightshade enters a
consecrated or hallowed
area, but the nightshade’s presence
also suppresses the
consecrated or hallowed effect for as
long as it remains in
the area.

NIGHTSHADE
Illus. by T. Lockwood
Nightmare
195
This creature looks like an immense worm covered with plates of dead
black, chitinous armor. Its toothy maw is wider than a human is tall, and
its teeth and gullet are black, too.
A nightcrawler is a massive behemoth similar to a purple worm,
though utterly black in color.
A nightcrawler measures about 7 feet in diameter and is 100 feet
long from its toothy maw to the tip of its stinging tail. It weighs
about 55,000 pounds.
Combat
A nightcrawler attacks by burrowing through the ground and
emerging to strike.
A nightcrawler’s natural weapons are treated as magic
weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures inside a nightcrawler’s gizzard gain one negative level each round.
The DC is 26 for the Fortitude save to remove a
negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.
For each such negative level bestowed, the
nightcrawler gains 5 temporary hit points.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a
nightcrawler must hit with its bite attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can try
to swallow the opponent in the following round.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude
DC 22, initial and secondary

Summon Undead (Su): A
nightcrawler can summon undead creatures once per night: 9–16 shadows, 3–6
greater shadows, or 2–4 dread wraiths. The
undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1
hour or until released.
Swallow Whole (Ex): A nightcrawler can try
to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or
smaller size by making a successful grapple check.
Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of
bludgeoning damage plus 12 points of acid damage
per round from the nightcrawler’s gizzard and is
subject to the creature’s energy drain. A swallowed creature
can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing
weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.
A nightcrawler’s interior can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium,
128 Small, 512 Tiny or smaller opponents.

The creature looks like a humanoid giant, taller than a house
and composed of pure darkness.
It wears no clothing and has
smooth, hairless skin and a
genderless body.
Nightwalkers are human-shaped
horrors that haunt the darkness.
A nightwalker is about 20 feet tall and
weighs about 12,000 pounds.
Combat
Nightwalkers lurk in dark areas where they can
almost always surprise the unwary.
A nightwalker’s natural weapons are
treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Crush Item (Su): A nightwalker can destroy any
weapon or item of Large size or smaller (even magic ones, but
not artifacts) by picking it up and crushing it between its
hands. The nightwalker must make a successful disarm attempt to
grab an item held by an opponent. The item is entitled to a DC 34
Fortitude save to resist destruction. The save DC is Strength-based.
Evil Gaze (Su): Fear, 30 feet. A creature that meets the nightwalker’s gaze must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be paralyzed

1 hour or until released.
Skills: *When hiding in a dark area, a nightwalker gains a +8
racial bonus on Hide checks.
Tactics Round-by-Round
The nightwalker is an exceedingly intelligent foe that makes the
best use of all its abilities. It favors using its spell-like abilities to
divide and disable its enemies, then closing to melee with opponents it has isolated from their allies.
Prior to combat: The nightwalker keeps its see invisibility power
active most of the time. It uses haste and invisibility to prepare for
battle.
Round 1: Move to within 30 feet to make use of gaze attack and
strike with confusion or hold monster, coupled with a quickened
unholy blight.
Round 2: Hit a spellcaster with finger of death and another quickened unholy blight.
Round 3: Move up to engage the enemy and attempt to disarm an
enemy fighter.
Round 4: Crush the disarmed weapon (or use gaze attack if
disarm attempt failed).
Round 5: Full attack against the unarmed foe (or on a nearby
spellcaster).

The creature seems to be nothing but a mass of utter darkness shaped like
a monstrous bat.
Nightwings are batlike flyers that hunt on the wing.
A nightwing has a wingspan of about 40 feet and weighs about
4,000 pounds.
Combat
Nightwings prowl the night sky and dive onto their victims. They
are all but invisible, detectable only because of the stars they
obscure in their passing.
A nightwing’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Magic Drain (Su): A nightwing can weaken magic armor,
weapons, and shields by making a successful touch attack. The
targeted item must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or lose 1
point of its enhancement bonus (for example, a +2 sword becomes
a +1 sword). The save DC is Charisma-based. An item that loses its
entire enhancement bonus becomes merely a masterwork item
and loses any special abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting
dispel evil upon the item reverses the effect of the magic drain,
provided this occurs within a number of days after the attack
equal to the caster’s level and the caster succeeds on a DC 29
caster level check.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—contagion (DC 18), deeper darkness, detect magic, haste, see invisibility, unholy blight (DC 18);

This being’s beauty exceeds mere words; she is captivating and dangerous
because of the emotions she inspires. She has long, copper hair, perfect
skin, large eyes, and long, swept-back ears.
Nymphs are nature’s embodiment of physical beauty, and the
guardians of the sacred places of the wild. They are so unbearably lovely that even a glimpse of one can blind an onlooker.
Nymphs hate evil and any who would despoil the wilds for any
reason.
A nymph’s demeanor is wild and mercurial. Like nature itself,
she embodies both great beauty and fearsome danger. She
can be kind and graceful to mortals who revere the
wild places of the world, but is also quick to
strike against mortals who take more than
they need or who treat nature thoughtlessly. Animals of all types flock to a
nymph, ignoring the presence of
natural enemies; injured beasts
know that the nymph will tend
their wounds.
A nymph is about the height
and weight of a female elf.
Nymphs speak Sylvan and
Common.
COMBAT
A nymph usually avoids contact
with nonfey, but she often has a
place she holds sacred and
defends against all intrusion—a
grove, a pool, or sometimes a hilltop or peak. She uses her spells
and animal allies to drive intruders away from the spot she
defends, preferring to use nonlethal attacks first and resorting
to deadly attacks only when faced
by evil creatures or intruders who
reply to her efforts with deadly
attacks of their own.
Nymphs are better disposed
toward elves, half-elves, and
druids, individuals they recognize as friends of nature.
They are likely to offer such
people a chance to explain their
presence instead of driving
them away. Nymphs have also
been known to aid good heroes
who approach them in a courteous and respectful manner.
Blinding Beauty (Su): This ability
affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a nymph.
Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the blindness
spell. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—dimension door. Caster level 7th.
Spells: A nymph casts divine spells as a 7th-level druid.
Typical Druid Spells Prepared (6/5/4/3/1, save DC 13 + spell level):
0—cure minor wounds, detect magic, flare, guidance, light, resistance;
1st—calm animal, cure light wounds, entangle, longstrider, speak with
animals; 2nd—barkskin, heat metal, lesser restoration, tree shape; 3rd—
call lightning, cure moderate wounds, protection from energy; 4th—rusting grasp.
Stunning Glance (Su): As a standard action, a wrathful nymph
can stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target creature
must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4
rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Unearthly Grace (Su): A nymph adds her Charisma modifier
as a bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to
her Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these
bonuses).
Wild Empathy (Ex): This power works like the druid’s wild
empathy class feature, except that a nymph has a +6 racial bonus
on the check.
Skills: A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. She can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
endangered. She can use the run action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.
OGRE
This hulking brute appears to be at least 9
feet tall. It has a thick hide covered in dark,
warty bumps, it wears smelly skins, and its
hair is long, unkempt, and greasy.
Ogres are big, ugly, greedy creatures
that live by raiding and scavenging.
They join other monsters to prey on
the weak and associate freely with
ogre mages, giants, and trolls.
Lazy and bad-tempered, ogres
solve problems by smashing them;
what they can’t smash, they either
ignore or flee. Dwelling in small
tribal groups, ogres occupy any convenient location and eat nearly anything they can catch, steal, or slay.
Ogres sometimes accept mercenary service with other evil
humanoids (including humans).
Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet
tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds.
Their skin color ranges from dull
yellow to dull brown. Their
clothing consists of poorly
cured furs and hides, which add
to their naturally repellent odor.
Ogres speak Giant, and those
specimens who boast Intelligence scores of at least 10 also
speak Common.
Combat
Ogres favor overwhelming odds, sneak
attacks, and ambushes over a fair fight. They are
intelligent enough to fire ranged weapons first to soften up
their foes before closing, but ogre gangs and bands fight as unorganized individuals.
OGRE BARBARIAN
Their inherent bent toward chaos combines with their size and
strength to make ogres natural barbarians. Indeed, their leaders
are almost always barbarians of low to middle level, monstrous
brutes whose fury in battle is truly fearsome. A raging ogre barbarian is an inspiration to other ogres.
Combat
Marginally more intelligent than his brutish fellows, an ogre barbarian is slightly more likely to enter a fair fight, but in general
prefers the brutish tactics common to all its kind.

Rage (Ex): Twice per day, an ogre barbarian can enter a state of
fierce rage that last for 9 rounds. The following changes are in
effect as long as he rages: AC 17 (touch 8, flat-footed 17); hp 95;
Atk +18/+13 melee (2d6+16, +1 greatclub); SV Fort +14, Will +4; Str
30, Con 22; Climb +15, Jump +16. At the end of his rage, the ogre
barbarian is fatigued for the duration
of the encounter.
Trap Sense (Ex): An ogre barbarian has a +1 bonus on Reflex
saves made to avoid traps. He
also has a +1 bonus to his AC
against attacks by traps.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex):
An ogre barbarian retains
his Dex bonus to AC regardless of being caught
flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent. His
Dex bonus to AC is
+0, but this means that
he is not subject to a
rogue’s sneak attack in
these circumstances.
MERROW
These cousins of the ogre
have the aquatic subtype.
They dwell in freshwater
lakes and rivers. They have a
base land speed of 30 feet and
a swim speed of 40 feet and are
found only in aquatic environments. Instead of the typical
ogre’s greatclub, they prefer
to use longspears in melee
(attack +8 melee, damage
1d8+7).

This creature looks like a big,
demonic human. It has green
skin, dark hair, and a pair of short
ivory horns protruding from its
forehead. The eyes are dark with
strikingly white pupils, and its
teeth and claws are jet black.
The ogre mage is a more
intelligent and dangerous
variety of its mundane cousin.
Rapacious and cruel by nature,
ogre mages often lead organized raids for slaves, treasure,
and food.
These creatures dwell in
fortified structures or underground lairs, usually living alone or
with a small group of ogre followers. Status among ogre mages is
measured by wealth. While they do not generally associate with
their own kind, they often undertake raids and schemes in competition with one another to amass the most riches.
An ogre mage stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 700
pounds. Its skin varies in color from light green to light blue, and
its hair is black or very dark brown. Ogre mages favor loose, comfortable clothing and lightweight armor.
Ogre mages speak Giant and Common.
Combat
Ogre mages rely on their spell-like abilities, resorting to physical
combat only when necessary. When faced with obviously superior
forces, they prefer to retreat using gaseous form rather than fight a
losing battle. Ogre mages hold deep, abiding grudges, however,
and the unwise person who crosses one would do well to keep
looking over one’s shoulder.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—darkness, invisibility; 1/day—
charm person (DC 14), cone of cold (DC 18), gaseous form, polymorph,
sleep (DC 14). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Flight (Su): An ogre mage can cease or resume flight as a free
action. While using gaseous form it can fly at its normal speed and
has perfect maneuverability.
Regeneration (Ex): Fire and acid deal normal damage to an
ogre mage.
An ogre mage that loses a
limb or body part can reattach it by holding the severed
member to the stump. Reattachment takes 1 minute. If
the head or some other vital
organ is severed, it must be
reattached within 10 minutes
or the creature dies. An ogre
mage cannot regrow lost body
parts.

OGRE MAGE
Ogre mage

OOZE
Oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit
underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins,
and dungeons in search of organic matter—living or dead.
COMBAT
Oozes attack any creatures they encounter. They lash out with
pseudopods or simply engulf opponents with their bodies, which
secrete acids that help them catch or digest their prey.
Blindsight (Ex): An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory
organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.
BLACK PUDDING
This creature resembles nothing so much as a roundish blob of inky
black goo.
Black puddings slither and undulate along underground terrain
seeking sustenance.
The typical black pudding measures 15 feet across and 2 feet
thick. It weighs about 18,000 pounds.
Combat
A black pudding attacks by grabbing and squeezing their prey.
Acid (Ex): The creature secretes a digestive acid that
dissolves organic material
and metal quickly, but does
not affect stone. Any
melee hit or constrict
attack deals acid damage, and the opponent’s
armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless
they succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves. A metal or wooden
weapon that strikes a
black pudding also
dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on
a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
The pudding’s acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round
to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact
with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.
Constrict (Ex): A black pudding deals automatic slam and acid
damage with a successful grapple check. The opponent’s clothing
and armor take a –4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a black pudding must
hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins
the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Split (Ex): Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a
black pudding. Instead the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round
down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split
and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
Skills: A black pudding has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks
and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed
or threatened.
ELDER BLACK PUDDING
The most ancient black puddings are vast pools of inky
death.
Combat
The save DC for the elder
black pudding’s acid attack
(DC 29) is adjusted for its
additional Hit Dice and
higher Constitution score.

This creature looks like a thick wall of quivering, transparent protoplasm.
The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and
trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the
cube’s body.
A typical gelatinous cube is 15 feet on a side and weighs about
50,000 pounds, though much larger specimens are not unknown.
Combat
A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is
capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes.
Acid (Ex): A gelatinous cube’s acid does not harm metal or
stone.
Engulf (Ex): Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can
simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action.
It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs.
The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the opponents,
affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled
to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the cube
moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube’s paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped
within its body. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1
racial bonus.
Paralysis (Ex): A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing
slime. A target hit by a cube’s melee or engulf attack must succeed
on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube
can automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Transparent (Ex): Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under
ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one.
Creatures who fail to notice a cube and walk into it are automatically engulfed.

What seemed to be just a puddle of water is in fact a slimy horror that
moves and flows like some giant protozoan.
A gray ooze appears to be a harmless puddle of water, a patch of
wet sand, or a section of damp stone—until it moves or strikes.
A gray ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of about 6 inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700
pounds.
Combat
A gray ooze strikes like a snake, slamming opponents with its
body.
Acid (Ex): A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material and metal, but not stone. Any melee hit or
constrict attack deals acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves
and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16
Reflex save. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze
also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex
save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
The ooze’s acidic touch deals 16 points of damage per round to
wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact
with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.
Constrict (Ex): A gray ooze deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check. The opponent’s clothing and
armor take a –4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gray ooze must hit
with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Transparent (Ex): A gray ooze is hard to identify, even under
ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one.
Creatures who fail to notice a gray ooze and walk into it are automatically hit with a melee attack for slam and acid damage.

This creature resembles a giant, dark yellow amoeba.
An ochre jelly seeps along floors, walls, and ceilings with ease,
squeezing its malleable body under doors and through cracks in
search of meals.
An ochre jelly can grow to a diameter of about 15 feet and a
thickness of about 6 inches, but can compress its body to fit into
cracks as small as 1 inch wide. A typical specimen weighs about
5,600 pounds.
Combat
An ochre jelly attempts to envelop and squeeze its prey.
Acid (Ex): An ochre jelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves
only flesh. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage.
Constrict (Ex): An ochre jelly deals automatic slam and acid
damage with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an ochre jelly must hit
with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Split (Ex): Slashing and piercing weapons and electricity
attacks deal no damage to an ochre jelly. Instead the creature splits
into two identical jellies, each with half of the original’s current hit
points (round down). A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot be
further split and dies if reduced to 0 it points.
Skills: An ochre jelly has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and
can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or
threatened.

This creature looks like a primitive human with gray skin and coarse hair.
It has a stooped posture, low forehead, and a piglike face with prominent
lower canines that resemble a boar’s tusks.
Orcs are aggressive humanoids that raid, pillage, and battle other
creatures. They have a hatred of elves and dwarves that began generations ago, and often kill such creatures on sight.
An orc’s hair usually is black. It has lupine ears and reddish eyes.
Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green,
and deep purple. Their equipment is dirty and unkempt. An adult
male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds.
Females are slightly smaller.
When not actually fighting other creatures, orcs are usually
planning raids or practicing their fighting skills.
The language an orc speaks varies slightly from tribe to tribe,
but any orc is understandable by someone else who speaks Orc.
Some orcs know Goblin or Giant as well.
Most orcs encountered away from their homes are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.
COMBAT
Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that
cause the most damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up
the warrior or fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion
or the greataxe as a martial weapon. They
enjoy attacking from concealment
and setting ambushes, and
they obey the rules of war
(such as honoring a truce)
only as long as it is convenient for them.
Light Sensitivity
(Ex): Orcs are dazzled in bright
sunlight or within the radius
of a daylight spell.
ORC
Orc
203
ORC SOCIETY
Orcs believe that to survive, they must conquer as much territory
as possible, which puts them at odds with all intelligent creatures
that live near them. They are constantly warring with or preparing
to war with other humanoids, including other orc tribes. They can
ally with other humanoids for a time but quickly rebel if not commanded by orcs. Their deities teach them that all other beings are
inferior and that all worldly goods rightfully belong to the orcs,
having been stolen by the others. Orc spellcasters are ambitious,
and rivalries between them and warrior leaders sometimes tear a
tribe apart.
Orc society is patriarchal: Females are prized possessions at best
and chattel at worst. Male orcs pride themselves on the number of
females they own and male children they sire, as well as their
battle prowess, wealth, and amount of territory. They wear their
battle scars proudly and ritually scar themselves to mark significant achievements and turning points in their lives.
An orc lair may be a cave, a series of wooden huts, a fort, or even
a large city built above and below ground. A tribe includes females
(as many as there are males), young (half as many as there are
females), and slaves (about one for every ten males).
The chief orc deity is Gruumsh, a one-eyed god who tolerates
no sign of peaceability among his people.
ORCS AS CHARACTERS
Orc leaders tend to be barbarians. Orc clerics worship Gruumsh.
An orc cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos,
Evil, Strength, or War (favored weapon: any spear). Most orc spellcasters are adepts. Orc adepts favor spells that deal damage.
Orc Traits (Ex): Orcs possess the following racial traits.
— +4 Strength, –2 Intelligence, –2 Wisdom, –2 Charisma.
—An orc’s base land speed is 30 feet.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Light Sensitivity: Orcs are dazzled in bright sunlight or
within the radius of a daylight spell.

The orc warrior presented here had the following ability scores

Cha 8.
HALF-ORCS
These orc–human crossbreeds can be found in
either orc or human society (where their
status varies according to local sentiments), or in communities of their
own. Half-orcs usually inherit a
good blend of the physical characteristics of their parents. They
are as tall as humans and a little
heavier, thanks to their muscle.
They have greenish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws,
prominent teeth, and coarse body hair.
Half-orcs who have lived among or
near orcs have scars, in keeping with
orcish tradition.
Half-Orc Traits (Ex): Half-orcs possess
the following racial traits.
— +2 Strength, –2 Intelligence, –2 Charisma.
—Medium size.
—A half-orc’s base land speed is 30
feet.
—Darkvision: Half-orcs can see in the
dark up to 60 feet.
—Orc Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-orc is considered an orc. Half-orcs, for example, are just as vulnerable to special
effects that affect orcs as their orc ancestors are, and they can use
magic items that are only usable by orcs.

This creature looks like a bloated ovoid covered with a rocklike skin. A
vinelike stalk about 2 feet long rises from the top of the disgusting body
and bears the two eyes. Its mouth—little more than a wide gash filled
with razor-sharp teeth—is in the center of the mass. The creature shuffles
about on three thick, sturdy legs and has two long tentacles covered in
rough, thorny protrusions. The tentacles end in leaflike appendages
covered in more thorny growths.
OTYUGH
Illus. by T. Lockwood
Otyugh
204
Otyughs are grotesque subterranean monsters that lurk within
heaps of refuse. Although primarily scavengers that can eat almost
any kind of refuse, they never object to a meal of fresh meat when
the opportunity presents itself.
An otyugh spend most of its time within its lair, which it keeps
filled with carrion, offal, and all manner of similar trash. An
otyugh usually covers itself with this vile stuff, leaving only its
sensory stalk exposed (the stack also carries the otyugh’s olfactory
organ) and lies there for hours, shoveling food into its mouth.
Intelligent subterranean beings sometimes coexist with otyughs,
which they regard as convenient garbage disposals: They dump
their refuse in the lair of the otyugh, which generally refrains
from attacking them.
A typical otyugh has a body 8 feet in diameter and weighs about
500 pounds.
Otyughs speak Common.
COMBAT
An otyugh attacks living creatures if it feels threatened or if it is
hungry; otherwise it is content to remain hidden. Otyughs slash
and squeeze opponents with their tentacles, which they also use to
drag prey into their mouths.
Constrict (Ex): An otyugh deals automatic tentacle damage
with a successful grapple check.
Disease (Ex): Filth fever—bite,
Fortitude DC 14, incubation
period 1d3 days; damage 1d3
Dex and 1d3 Con. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use
this ability, an otyugh must hit
with a tentacle attack. It can
then attempt to start a grapple as
a free action without provoking
an attack of opportunity. If it wins
the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can constrict.
Skills: *An otyugh has a +8 racial
bonus on Hide checks when in its lair,
due to its natural coloration.

Giant owls are nocturnal birds of prey, feared for their ability to
hunt and attack in near silence. They are intelligent, and though
naturally suspicious, sometimes associate with good creatures.
They attack creatures that appear threatening, especially those
intent on raiding the owls’ nest for eggs or fledglings, which fetch
a handsome price in many civilized areas. Young owls can be
trained and are prized as aerial mounts.
A typical giant owl stands about 9 feet tall, has a wingspan of up
to 20 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way
except size.
Giant owls speak Common and Sylvan.
COMBAT
A giant owl attacks by gliding silently just a few feet above its prey
and plunging to strike when directly overhead.
A solitary giant owl is typically hunting or patrolling in the vicinity of its nest and generally ignores creatures that do not appear
threatening. A mated pair of giant owls will attack in concert and
fight to the death to
defend their nest. Several giant owls sometimes
operate as a company for
some specific purpose, such as
driving away a group of evil
humanoids.
Superior Low-Light Vision
(Ex): A giant owl can see five times as
far as a human can in dim light.
Skills: Giant owls have a +8 racial
bonus on Listen checks and a +4 racial
bonus on Spot checks.
*When in flight, giant owls gain a +8
bonus on Move Silently checks.
TRAINING A
GIANT OWL
Although intelligent, a giant
owl requires training before it
can bear a rider in combat. To be
trained, a giant owl must have a
friendly attitude toward the trainer
(this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a
friendly giant owl requires six
weeks of work and a DC 25
Handle Animal check. Riding
a giant owl requires an exotic
saddle. A giant owl can fight while carrying a
rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
she succeeds on a Ride check.
Giant owl eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece
on the open market, while chicks are
worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant
owl.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a
giant owl is up to 300 pounds; a medium
load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load,
601–900 pounds.

This creature has a thick, shaggy
coat of feathers and fur. Its body is
like a bear’s, but it has an avian
head with big, round eyes and a
hooked beak.
Owlbears are extraordinarily vicious predators with a reputation
for ferocity, aggression, and sheer ill temper. They tend to attack
nearly anything that moves without provocation.
Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most
common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. An owlbear’s coat ranges
in color from brown-black to yellowish brown; its beak is a dull
ivory color. A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weigh
up to 1,500 pounds. Adventurers who have survived encounters
with the creature often speak of the bestial madness they
glimpsed in its red-rimmed eyes.
Owlbears inhabit wilderness areas, making their lairs within
tangled forests or in shallow underground caverns. They can be
active during the day or night, depending on the habits of the
available prey. Adults live in mated pairs and hunt in packs, leaving their young in the lair. A lair usually has 1d6 young, fetching a
price of 3,000 gp each in many civilized areas. While owlbears
cannot be domesticated, they can still be placed in strategically
important areas as free-roaming guardians. Professional trainers
charge 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear (DC 23 for a young creature, DC 30 for an adult).
COMBAT
Owlbears attack prey—any creature bigger than a mouse—on
sight, always fighting to the death. They slash with claws and beak,
trying to grab their prey and rip it apart.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an owlbear must hit
with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

This creature looks like a horse but has two large,
feathered wings. Its coat and wings are pure white.
The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves
the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are
wild and shy creatures not easily tamed.
Pegasi mate for life, building their nests in high, remote locations. A mated pair have either 1–2 eggs or 1–2 young in their
nest.
A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs
1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Rumors tell of some
specimens that are brown or black instead of white.
Pegasi cannot speak, but they understand Common.
COMBAT
Pegasi attack with their sharp hooves and powerful bite. Mated
pairs and herds attack as a team, fighting to the death to defend
their eggs and young.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—detect good and detect evil within a
60-foot radius. Caster level 5th.
Skills: Pegasi have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Soft, squelching footfalls and a strange, moldy odor
indicate that some creature is nearby—but nothing can be
seen.
This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a
cluster of nodules atop the main mass, though it is visible
only when dead. A cluster of nodules atop the main
mass serve as sensory organs. The creature feeds and
attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth.
Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it
to move about.
This ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator among
subterranean inhabitants.
COMBAT
A phantom fungus usually roams
quietly, hunting for prey. It
attacks lone individuals almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it
prefers an open space where it has a better
chance .
Greater Invisibility (Su): This ability is constant,
allowing a phantom fungus to remain invisible even
when attacking. It works like greater invisibility
(caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the phantom fungus is alive. This ability is not subject to
the invisibility purge spell. A phantom fungus
becomes visible 1 minute after it is killed.
Skills: A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move
Silently checks.

PHASE SPIDER
Phantom fungus illus. by C. Crichlow
Pegasus
Phantom fungus 207
This creature resembles a giant wolf spider, except with a larger head and
variegated markings in white, gray, and blue over the legs and back. Its
eight eyes are silver-white.
Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from
the Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane.
A typical phase spider’s body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700
pounds.
Phase spiders cannot speak.
COMBAT
Phase spiders dwell and hunt on
the Material Plane. Once a spider locates prey, however, it
shifts to the Ethereal Plane to
attack, attempting to catch its
victim flat-footed. The spider
shifts in, bites its victim,
and retreats quickly back
to the Ethereal Plane.
Ethereal Jaunt
(Su): A phase spider can shift
from the Ethereal Plane
to the
Material Plane as a free action,
and shift back again as a move
action (or during a move action). The ability is otherwise
identical with ethereal jaunt (caster level 15th).
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary
damage 1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Skills: A phase spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks
and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed
or threatened.

Level Adjustment: —
This creature looks like a slithering blob of multicolored goo perhaps 5 feet
wide and a little less than half that high.
A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of
almost any other creature or object.
Its shapeshifting ability frees a phasm from most material
needs, which usually leads it to a life of exploration, hedonism, or
philosophical contemplation. There’s no telling where
a phasm will turn up, nor what it will do if discovered. They are natural spies but notoriously unreliable, since they feel no
particular need to report
what they learn. They
have an affinity for
d o p p e l g a n g e r s
and sometimes
ally themselves
with groups of
them for security—or just
for the fun
of it.
A phasm in its natural form is about 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet
high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory organs. In this
form, a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack with a
pseudopod. It weighs about 400 pounds.
Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication.
COMBAT
When faced with potential danger, a phasm is equally likely to
retreat, parley, or attack, as its fancy strikes. Phasms value new
experiences: fresh scents and tastes, obscure facts, gossip, odd brica-brac, and the like. Those who offer a phasm such things stand a
good chance of avoiding a fight.
If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the
most fearsome creature it knows, such as an adult
white dragon or a fire giant, and attacks. When seriously hurt, it changes to some fast or agile
form and tries to escape.
Amorphous (Ex): A phasm in its natural form has immunity to poison,
sleep, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. It is not subject to critical hits and, having no clear front or
back, cannot be flanked.
Resilient (Ex): A phasm has a +4
racial bonus on Fortitude and Reflex
saves (included in the statistics block).
Alternate Form (Su): A phasm can assume any form of Large
size or smaller as a standard action. This ability functions as a polymorph spell cast on itself (caster level 15th), except that the phasm
does not regain hit points for changing form. A phasm can remain
in its alternate form until it chooses to assume a new one or return
to its natural form.
Tremorsense (Ex): A phasm can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground,
so long as it is touching the ground itself.
Skills: *When using shapechange, a phasm gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks.

PLANETOUCHED
209
PLANETOUCHED
Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can
trace his or her bloodline back to an outsider, usually a fiend or
celestial.
The effects of having a supernatural being in one’s heritage last
for many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a
half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special
qualities.
The two planetouched varieties described here are the most
common. Aasimars are humans with some trace of celestial blood
in their veins, and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family
tree.
There is no “typical” aasimar or tiefling. They do not have their
own societies or cultures, instead blending into existing ones.
Many have character classes.

This being looks like a beautiful human,
with calm, serene features and an inner
radiance that shines from its face.
Graced with a touch of the holy, aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and
generally pleasant. Some have a minor
physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver hair, golden
eyes, or an unnaturally
intense stare.
Most aasimars are
decidedly good-aligned.
They fight against evil causes
and attempt to sway others to do
the right thing. Occasionally they take on
the vengeful, judgmental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this
is rare. They are rarely found in leadership positions and often live
as loners due to their absolute dedication to goodness. Others are
less fanatical and fit seamlessly into normal human society.
Combat
Aasimars usually like a fair, straightforward contest. Against a particularly evil foe, however, they fight with utter conviction and to
the death.
Daylight (Sp): An aasimar can use daylight once per day as a 1stlevel caster or a caster of his class levels, whichever is higher.
Skills: An aasimar has a +2 racial bonus on Spot and Listen

This being looks like a human, but it has a faintly disturbing demeanor
about it and a wicked gleam in its eyes. Short horns sprout from its forehead.
Twisted, devious, and untrustworthy, tieflings more often than
not follow their inherent tendencies and heed the call to evil. A
few defy their nature, but still must fight against popular opinion
(if their nature is known) or the feeling of otherworldly “wrongness” that seems to follow them wherever they go.
Aside from a demeanor that many find disturbing, many
tieflings are indistinguishable from humans. Others have small
horns, pointed teeth, red eyes, a whiff of brimstone about them, or
even cloven feet. No two tieflings are the same.
In most human societies, tieflings maintain a low profile, operating as thieves, assassins, or spies. Occasionally one rises to a position of power, but when its nature is revealed it quickly becomes
an outcast.
Combat
Tieflings are sneaky, subtle, and
generally conniving. They prefer to
strike from ambush
and usually avoid a fair
fight if they can.
Darkness (Sp): A tiefling can
use darkness once per day (caster
level equal to class levels).
Skills: A tiefling has a +2 racial
bonus on Bluff and Hide checks.
The tiefling warrior presented here
had the following ability scores

This creature resembles a miniature red dragon, slightly smaller than a
housecat. It is red-brown in color rather than deep red. It has fine
scales and sharp horns and teeth. Its tail is about twice as long
as its body, barbed, and very flexible.
Pseudodragons are tiny, playful
members of the dragon family.
A pseudodragon has a body
about 1 foot long, with a 2-
foot tail. It weights about
7 pounds.
A pseudodragon
can communicate
t e l e p a t h i c a l l y
and can also vocalize animal
noises, such
as a rasping
purr (pleasure),
a hiss (unpleasant surprise), a
chirp (desire), or
a growl (anger).
COMBAT
A pseudodragon can deliver a vicious bite, but its principal
weapon is its sting-equipped tail.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage sleep for 1
minute, secondary damage sleep for 1d3 hours. The save DC is
Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Blindsense (Ex): A pseudodragon can locate creatures within
60 feet by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by
noticing vibration and other environmental clues). Opponents
the pseudodragon can’t actually see still have total concealment
against the pseudodragon.
Telepathy (Su): Pseudodragons can communicate telepathically with creatures that speak Common or Sylvan, provided they
are within 60 feet.
Skills: Pseudodragons have a chameleonlike ability that grants
them a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. *In forests or overgrown
areas, this bonus improves to +8.
PSEUDODRAGON COMPANIONS
A pseudodragon may very rarely seek humanoid companionship.
It stalks a candidate silently for days, reading his or her thoughts
and judging his or her deeds. If it finds the candidate promising,
the pseudodragon presents itself as a potential companion and observes the other’s reaction. If the candidate seems delighted and
promises to take very good care of it, the pseudodragon accepts.
Otherwise, it flies away.
A pseudodragon’s personality has been described as catlike.
At times the creature seems arrogant, demanding, and less than
helpful. It is willing to serve—provided that it is well fed and
groomed, and receives lots of attention. The companion
must pamper it and make it feel like the most
important thing in his or her life. If the pseudodragon is mistreated or insulted, it will leave—
or worse, play pranks when least expected.
Pseudodragons particularly dislike cruelty
and will not serve cruel masters.
A pseudodragon egg can fetch a price of
up to 10,000 gp, and a hatchling as much
as 20,000 gp. Pseudodragons have a life
span of 10 to 15 years. Like dragons, they
are attracted to bright, shiny objects.

This creature looks like a massive worm covered with plates of dark purple,
chitinous armor. Its toothy maw is as wide as a human is tall.
These massive scavengers attempt to consume any organic material they find. Purple worms are feared for swallowing their prey
whole: Entire groups of adventurers have vanished down their
gullets, one member after the other.
The body of a mature purple worm is 5 feet in diameter and 80
feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds. The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail.
A purple worm consumes great quantities of dirt and rock when
tunneling. Its gizzard may hold gems and other acid-resistant
items. In mineral-rich areas, purple worm castings might contain
unrefined ores.
COMBAT
In battle, a purple worm forms into a coil 20 feet in diameter,
biting and stinging anything within reach.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a purple worm must
hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it
wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can attempt to swallow the
foe the following round.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 25,
initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage
2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Swallow Whole (Ex): A purple worm can try to
swallow a grabbed opponent of a smaller size than
itself by making a successful grapple check. Once
inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of
crushing damage plus 8 points of acid
damage per round from the worm’s gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its
way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of
damage to the gizzard (AC 17). Once
the creature exits, muscular action
closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out. A
Gargantuan worm’s interior can hold 2
Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or
512 Diminutive or smaller opponents.
Skills: A purple worm has a +8
racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or
avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or
endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.

This being looks like a humanoid tiger garbed in expensive clothes. The
body seems mostly human except for a luxurious coat of tiger’s fur and
its tiger head.
Some say rakshasas are the very embodiment of evil. Few beings
are more malevolent.
A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands
are where the backs of the hands would be on a human. While
this doesn’t detract from the creature’s manual dexterity, it
makes a rakshasa look very disturbing to those unfamiliar with
the creature.
A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human.
Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon.
COMBAT
In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it
employs its sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible,
it uses its other abilities to make such encounters unnecessary.
Detect Thoughts (Su): A rakshasa can continuously use
detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15
negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spells: A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.
Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level):
0—detect magic, light, mage hand, message, read magic, resistance,
touch of fatigue; 1st—charm person, mage armor, magic missile, shield,
silent image; 2nd—bear’s endurance, invisibility, Melf ’s acid arrow;
3rd—haste, suggestion.
Change Shape (Su): A rakshasa can assume any humanoid
form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid
form, a rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often
equips itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains
in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in
form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural
form when killed. A true seeing spell reveals its natural form.
Skills: A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise
checks.
*When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10
circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent’s
mind, its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a further +4.
RAKSHASAS AS CHARACTERS
Rakshasa characters possess the following racial traits.
— +2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, +2 Intelligence,
+2 Wisdom, +6 Charisma.
—Medium size.
—A rakshasa’s base land speed is 40 feet.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Racial Hit Dice: A rakshasa begins with seven levels of outsider, which provide 7d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +7, and
base saving throw bonuses of Fort +5, Ref +5, and Will +5.
—Racial Skills: A rakshasa’s outsider levels give it skill points
equal to 10 × (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Bluff, Disguise,
Listen, Move Silently, Perform, Sense Motive, and Spot. A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks, and it can
gain further bonuses by using change shape (+10 on Disguise
checks) and detect thoughts (+4 on Bluff and Disguise checks).
—Racial Feats: A rakshasa’s outsider levels give it three feats.
— +9 natural armor bonus.
—Natural Weapons: Bite (1d6) and 2 claws (1d4).
—Detect Thoughts (Su): The save DC is 13 + the character’s Cha
modifier.
—Spells: A rakshasa character casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer. If the character takes additional levels of sorcerer, these
levels stack with the rakshasa’s base spellcasting ability for spells
known, spells per day, and other effects dependent on caster
level. For example, a rakshasa 2nd-level sorcerer has the same
spells known, spells per day, and caster level as any other 9thlevel sorcerer. A rakshasa character likewise uses the sum of its
racial spellcasting levels and class levels to determine the abilities of its familiar.
—Special Qualities (see above): Change shape, damage reduction 15/good and piercing, spell resistance equal to 27 + class
levels.
—Automatic Languages: Common, Infernal. Bonus Languages:
Sylvan, Undercommon.
—Favored Class: Sorcerer.

This vile creature must have at least a dozen long, spindly claws that hang
from its bulbous, floating body. Its round head is almost all mouth, and
its mouth is almost all teeth.
Rasts swarm in isolated pockets on distant planes, particularly the
Elemental Plane of Fire. Floating, fleshy sacks of teeth and claws,
these insatiable creatures eat almost continuously.
At its heart, a rast is a creature of ash and cinder, but it feasts on
blood with a lust that would shame most normal beasts. A rast has
anywhere from ten to fifteen claws, though it can only use four at
once.
A rast has a body about the size of a large dog’s, with a head
almost as large as the body. It weighs about 200 pounds.
COMBAT
Rasts attack with a frightening, brutal cunning. The creatures paralyze as many of their foes as possible, then attack any that are still

same round.
Paralyzing Gaze (Su): Paralysis for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

without provoking an attack of opportunity.
Blood Drain (Ex): A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold.
Flight (Su): A rast can cease or resume flight as a free action. A
rast that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action
(either a move action or an attack action) each round.

This creature has a long, serpentine body that trails away
as it floats effortlessly through the air, and a single
claw that juts forward near its head.
Ravids are creatures from the Positive
Energy Plane. These bizarre entities imbue
creatures with energy by their touch and
animate lifeless objects around them.
Ravids that make their way to the Material Plane wander about aimlessly, followed
by the objects to which they have given
life.
A ravid is about 7 feet long and weighs
about 75 pounds.
COMBAT
Ravids fight only in self-defense. A ravid itself is not very powerful but is always accompanied by at least one animated object that
defends it.
R A V I D
Rast

Positive Energy Lash (Su): A ravid can make a touch attack or
hit with a claw or tail slap attack to infuse a target with positive energy. The energy produces an unpleasant tingle in
living creatures, and against undead foes (even incorporeal ones) it deals 2d10 points of damage.
Animate Objects (Su): Once per round, a
random object within 20 feet of a ravid animates as
though by the spell animate objects (caster level 20th).
These objects defend the ravid to the best of their ability, but the ravid isn’t intelligent enough to employ elaborate tactics with them.
Flight (Su): A ravid can cease or resume flight as a
free action. A rast that loses this ability falls and can
perform only a single action (either a move action
or an attack action) each round.
Feats: A ravid has the Multiattack feat even
through it does not have the requisite three
natural weapons.

The beast looks like a huge worm with dozens of insectoid legs,
faceted eyes, and a wide mouth brimming with jagged teeth. The back
of the head bristles with a pair of winglike fins.
The remorhaz is an arctic monster, an aggressive predator that
burrows through ice and earth.
Although wild remorhazes prey on frost giants (as well as polar
bears, elk, and deer), the giants occasionally train or entice these
beasts to guard their lairs.
A remorhaz is whitish-blue in color but pulses with a reddish
glow from the heat its body produces. The creature is a little more
than 20 feet long, with a body about 5 feet wide. It weighs about
10,000 pounds.
Remorhazes cannot speak.
COMBAT
Remorhazes hide under the snow and ice until they hear movement above them, then attack from below and surprise prey.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a remorhaz
must hit an opponent least one size category smaller than
itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can
attempt to swallow the opponent the following round.
Swallow Whole (Ex): When a remorhaz begins its turn with
a grappled opponent in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent
with a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent
takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 points of
fire damage per round from the remorhaz’s gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard
(AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole;
another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.
A Huge remorhaz’s interior can hold 2 Large, 4
Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or
512 Fine or smaller opponents.
Heat (Ex): An enraged remorhaz
generates heat so intense that anything touching its body takes 8d6
points of fire damage. Creatures
striking a remorhaz with natural
attacks or unarmed attacks are subject
to this damage, but creatures striking
with melee weapons do not take damage
from the remorhaz’s heat. This heat can melt
or char weapons; any weapon that strikes a

This creature is an enormous bird, easily the size of a building.
Almost too big to be believed, rocs are huge birds of prey that
dwell in warm mountainous regions and are known for carrying
off large animals (cattle, horses, even elephants).
A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail.
In a few rare instances, red, black, or white rocs are sighted, but
they are often considered bad omens. These enormous creatures
are 30 feet long from the beak to the base of the tail, with wingspans as wide as 80 feet. A roc weighs about
8,000 pounds.
Rocs lair in vast nests made from
trees, branches, lumber, and the like.
They prefer to dwell high in the mountains, far from other rocs, to avoid straining their food supply; they hunt within
a radius of about 10 miles around
their nests.
COMBAT
A roc attacks from the air, swooping
earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself
and its young to devour. A
solitary roc is typically hunting and
will attack any Medium or larger
creature that appears edible. A
mated pair of rocs attack in concert,
fighting to the death to defend
their nests or hatchlings.
Skills: Rocs have a +4 racial

This creature looks much like a natural stalagmite about 10
feet tall. Its great, gaping maw lined with crystalline teeth
suggests it is a meat eater.
Ropers are hideous creatures that lurk in the deep caverns of the world. They are altogether evil and far more
intelligent than most people would judge by their
appearance.
ROPER
Roc
Roper 215
A roper stands some 9 feet tall and tapers from 3 or 4 feet in
diameter at the base to 1 foot across at the top. It weighs 2,200
pounds. A roper’s coloration and temperature change to match the
features of the surrounding cave.
Ropers speak Terran and Undercommon.
COMBAT
A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of rock.
This tactic often allows it to attack with surprise. When prey
comes within reach, it lashes out with its strands. In melee, it bites
adjacent opponents with its powerful maw.
Drag (Ex): If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand latches
onto the opponent’s body. This deals no damage but drags the
stuck opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking
no attack of opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which
requires a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check.
The check DCs are Strength-based, and the Escape Artist DC
includes a +4 racial bonus. A roper can draw in a creature within
10 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round.
A strand has 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a roper’s strand does
not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the strand is currently
attached to a target, the roper takes a –4 penalty on its opposed
attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a strand deals no
damage to a roper.
Strands (Ex): Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires
strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at
once, and they can strike up to 50 feet away (no range increment).
If a strand is severed, the roper can extrude a new one on its next
turn as a free action.
Weakness (Ex): A roper’s strands can sap an opponent’s
strength. Anyone grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC 18
Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of Strength damage. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
Skills: *Ropers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in stony
or icy areas.

This creature seems to be about the size of a
pony. It has four insectlike legs and a squat, humped. body protected by a
thick, lumpy hide. Its tail is covered with armor plates and ends in a bony
projection that looks like a double-ended paddle. The creature sports two
long antennae on its head, one beneath each eye.
Most fighters would rather face an army of orcs than confront a
rust monster. These creatures corrode and eat metal objects and
have ruined the armor, shields, and weapons of countless adventurers.
The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan
underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster’s prehensile
antennae can rust metals on contact.
The typical rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high,
weighing 200 pounds.
COMBAT
A rust monster can scent a metal object from up to 90 feet away.
When it detects one, it dashes toward the source and attempts to
strike it with its antennae. The creature is relentless, chasing characters over long distances if they still possess intact metal objects
but usually ceasing its attacks to devour a freshly rusted meal. A
clever (or desperate) character can often distract a hungry rust
monster by tossing it some metal objects, then fleeing while it
consumes them.
The creature targets the largest metal object available, striking
first at armor, then at shields and smaller items. It prefers ferrous
metals (steel or iron) over precious metals (such as gold or silver)
but will devour the latter if given the opportunity.
Rust (Ex): A rust monster that makes a successful touch attack
with its antennae causes the target metal to corrode, falling to
pieces and becoming useless immediately. The touch can destroy
up to a 10-foot cube of metal instantly. Magic armor and weapons,
and other magic items made of metal, must succeed on a DC 17
Reflex save or be dissolved. The save DC is Constitution-based and
includes a +4 racial bonus.
A metal weapon that deals damage to a rust monster corrodes
immediately. Wooden, stone, and other nonmetallic weapons are
unaffected.

This humanoid has scaly skin with webbed fingers and toes, and sharp
fangs fill its mouth. It has a long tail ending in a curved fin, and it has fins
on its arms, back, and head. Its great, staring eyes are deep black.
Sahuagin are marine predators superbly adapted to undersea
hunting. Also known as sea devils, these beings dwell in coastal
waters, forming organized groups that raid shore communities.
Most sahuagin feature green coloration, darker along the back and
lighter on the belly. Many have dark stripes, bands, or
spots, but these tend to fade with age. An adult male sahuagin stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.
Sahuagin are the natural enemy of aquatic elves. The two
cannot coexist peacefully: Wars between them are prolonged,
bloody affairs that sometimes interfere with shipping and maritime trade. Sahuagin have an only slightly less vehement
hatred for tritons.
Sahuagin speak their own language, Sahuagin.
Thanks to their high Intelligence scores, most sahuagin also speak two bonus languages, usually Common
and Aquan.
COMBAT
Sahuagin are savage fighters, asking for and giving no
quarter. When swimming, a sahuagin tears with its
feet as it strikes with its talons or a weapon. About
half of any group of sahuagin are also armed with nets.
When sahuagin raid surface dwellers’ communities, they venture ashore on dark, moonless nights to slaughter the inhabitants
and livestock for food. They attack ships by swarming up from all
sides, leaving a portion of their forces in the water as reinforcements or to deal with opponents the raiders throw into the sea.
Blindsense (Ex): A sahuagin can locate creatures underwater
within a 30-foot radius. This ability works only when the sahuagin
is underwater.
Blood Frenzy: Once per day a sahuagin that takes damage in
combat can fly into a frenzy in the following round, clawing and
biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +2
Constitution and +2 Strength, and takes a –2 penalty to Armor
Class. A sahuagin cannot end its frenzy voluntarily.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +2 melee, damage 1d4+1. A sahuagin
also gains two rake attacks when it attacks while swimming.
Freshwater Sensitivity (Ex): A sahuagin fully immersed in
fresh water must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become
fatigued. Even on a success, it must repeat the save attempt every
10 minutes it remains immersed.
Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as
sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds sahuagin for round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled while operating in bright light.
Speak with Sharks (Ex): Sahuagin can communicate telepathically with sharks up to 150 feet away. The communication is
limited to fairly simple concepts such as “food,” “danger,” and
“enemy.” Sahuagin can use the Handle Animal skill to befriend
and train sharks.
Water Dependent (Ex): Sahuagin can survive out of the water
for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the
drowning rules on page 304 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).
Skills: A sahuagin has a +8 racial bonus on any
Swim check to perform some special action or
avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
*Underwater, a sahuagin has a +4 racial
bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks.

SAHUAGIN MUTANTS
About one in two hundred sahuagin has four arms. Such creatures
can make four claw attacks or use extra weapons, in addition to the
claw and bite attacks.
If a community of aquatic elves is located within 100 miles of a
sahuagin community, about one in one hundred sahuagin looks
just like an aquatic elf. These creatures, called malenti, have a swim
speed of 40 feet, can remain out of water for 1 hour per point of
Constitution, and have freshwater sensitivity and light sensitivity
(dazzled in bright light). Malenti have no natural attacks. They are
otherwise identical with sahuagin.
SAHUAGIN SOCIETY
The sea devils live by a code of ritualized behavior developed over
millennia. Every member of a sahuagin
community knows its place well—and
remains there. The sahuagin
pride themselves on
self-sufficiency and
strict adherence to
their social code.
Unfortunately for
others, one of
their core beliefs is
that the survival of
the sahuagin depends on ruthlessly
eradicating anything
that is not sahuagin.
Sahuagin dwell in
communities of varying sizes, from villages
to cities, built of stone
and other natural materials deep beneath the
ocean waves. The creatures employ a variety
of defenses, both passive (such as seaweed
camouflage) and active
(such as traps and tame
sharks), to protect their communities. Elite groups of senior
males (especially the four-armed ones) rule each community:
A baron governs a village, while a prince rules approximately
twenty villages. Sahuagin kings rule much larger territories and
dwell within cities having as many as six thousand inhabitants. A
sahuagin kingdom generally covers an entire seacoast, with villages and towns at least 100 miles apart. Sahuagin clerics function
as teachers and keepers of lore, controlling religious life in their
communities. Despite the presence of these priestesses within
their society, the superstitious sea devils distrust and fear magic.
The patron deity of sahuagin is Sekolah, a great devil shark.
SAHUAGIN CHARACTERS
A male sahuagin’s favored class is ranger, and most sahuagin leaders are rangers. Most sahuagin rangers choose humanoids (elves)
as their favored enemy. Female sahuagin favor the cleric class.
Sahuagin clerics worship Sekolah. A sahuagin cleric has access to
two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, or War (favored
weapon: trident).
SALAMANDER
This being has a muscular humanoid upper body with a hawkish face.
Its body is serpentine from the waist down, and is covered in red and
black scales. Flame-shaped spines sprout form the creature’s spine,
arms, and head.
The Elemental Plane of Fire is home to many strange creatures,
including the fearsome legions of the salamanders. These serpentine beings dwell in metal cities glowing with supernatural heat.
Salamanders are selfish and cruel, and they enjoy tormenting
others. They are rarely encountered without their heated metal
spears, but sometimes wield other weapons.
When summoned to the Material Plane, salamanders often
assist forge workers and smiths. Their ability to work metal while
it’s still in the fire makes them some of the best metalsmiths
known anywhere.
Salamanders reproduce asexually, each producing a single
larva every ten years and incubating the young in fire pits until
they reach maturity. Flamebrothers and average salamanders are
actually different species, while nobles rise from the ranks of the
average.
Salamanders speak Ignan. Some average
salamanders and all nobles also speak
Common.
COMBAT
Salamanders use metal spears
heated red-hot by their own
furnacelike bodies. Bloodthirsty and sadistic,
they are quick to attack. They prefer to
take on those who
appear strongest
first, saving weaker
enemies for slower,
agonizing treatment
later.
If a salamander
has damage reduction, its natural
weapons are treated
as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Constrict (Ex): A salamander deals automatic tail slap damage
(including fire damage) with a successful
grapple check. A noble salamander can constrict multiple creatures simultaneously, provided they are all at least two sizes
smaller than it.
Heat (Ex): A salamander generates so much heat that its mere
touch deals additional fire damage. Salamanders’ metallic weapons also conduct this heat.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a salamander must hit
a creature of up to one size larger than itself with its tail slap attack.
It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can constrict.
Spell-Like Abilities: (Noble salamanders only) 3/day—burning hands (DC 13), fireball (DC 15), flaming sphere (DC 14), wall of fire
(DC 16); 1/day—dispel magic, summon monster VII (Huge fire elemental). Caster level 15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Skills: Salamanders have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (blacksmithing) checks.
Feats: Salamanders have the Multiattack feat even though they
do not have the requisite three natural weapons.
SALAMANDER SOCIETY
Flamebrothers, the smallest of the salamanders, are barbaric and
tribal. Often more sophisticated salamanders force their civilization upon their smaller kin. Salamander nobility make a point of
traveling through the planes, learning secrets to further their
power. These experienced creatures eventually return to master
their own kind and raise mighty kingdoms.
In a mixed society, status is determined by size and power—
flamebrothers are the lowest class and the front ranks of salamander armies. Average salamanders are the middle class and the main
fighting force, while noble salamanders are commanders.
Salamander nations do their best to resist the mighty elemental
lords on their plane, and they disdain the azers, efreet, and other
inhabitants. They often fail, though, and are enslaved by other
fiery masters or conscripted into elemental armies.
SALAMANDER CHARACTERS
Flamebrothers have no favored class. They sometimes become
adepts or warriors. Average or noble salamanders may be clerics,
sorcerers, or fighters (their favored class).

This being might best be described as a horned man with the legs of a
goat.
Satyrs, also known as fauns, are hedonistic creatures
that frolic in the wild places of the world. They
love fine food, strong drink, and passionate romance.
A satyr’s hair is red or chestnut
brown, while its hooves and horns
are jet black.
A satyr is far more likely to be
carrying musical instruments
or bottles of wine than weapons. For the most part, satyrs leave
travelers alone. They are, however, more than a little mischievous and often seek fun
at the expense of those
who wander too near their
woodland homes.
A satyr is about as tall
and heavy as a
half-elf.
Satyrs speak Sylvan,
and most also speak
Common.
COMBAT
The keen senses of a satyr
make it almost impossible
to surprise one in the wild.
Conversely, with their
own natural grace and
agility, satyrs can sneak
up on travelers who are not
carefully watching the surrounding wilderness.
Once engaged in battle,
an unarmed satyr attacks
with a powerful head butt.
A satyr expecting trouble
is likely to be armed with a bow and a dagger and typically looses
arrows from hiding, weakening an enemy before closing.
Pipes (Su): Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on their
pan pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries pipes. When it
plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must
succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected by charm person, sleep,
or fear (caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).
In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A
creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe’s effects
cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save
DC is Charisma-based.
A satyr often uses its pipes to charm and seduce especially
comely women or to put a party of adventurers to sleep and then
steal their valuables.
Skills: Satyrs have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.
SATYRS AS CHARACTERS
Satyr characters possess the following racial traits.
— +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom,
+2 Charisma.
—Medium size.
—A satyr’s base land speed is 40 feet.

—Racial Hit Dice: A satyr begins with five levels of fey, which
provide 5d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving
throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4.
—Racial Skills: A satyr’s fey levels give it skill points equal to 8
× (6 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Bluff, Hide, Knowledge
(nature), Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot. Satyrs have a +4
racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot
checks.

This creature has a body like that of a porpoise or a small whale, with a
leonine head and forepaws. A ruff of silky hair runs from the top of its head
all the way to its tail flukes.
The sea cat is a fearsome aquatic predator.
Sea cats inhabit shallow coastal waters, making their lairs in
undersea caves or in the wreckage of ships. They hunt for fish,
aquatic mammals, sea birds, and anything else they can catch and
kill.
SEA CAT
Satyr
220
Sea cats are aggressively territorial, attacking any creature,
regardless of size, that enters their domain. Their chief enemies
and competitors are sharks, and sea cats go out of their way to
attack them. Sometimes they form temporary prides to deal with
particularly dangerous or resistant intruders. Their normal pride
structure is much like that of terrestrial lions.
A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.
COMBAT
Sea cats attack on sight, either for food or to defend their territory,
and use both claws and teeth to grab and rend their prey. They display tremendous courage, always fighting to the death, even
against creatures many times their size. Pairs and prides of sea cats
attack in concert, trying to wear the opponent down until one
beast can dispatch it.
Hold Breath (Ex): A sea cat can hold its breath for a number of
rounds equal to 6 × its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Rend (Ex): A sea cat that hits with both claw attacks latches
onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This automatically
deals an extra 2d6+6 points of damage.
Skills: A sea cat has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can
use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a
straight line.
SHADOW
This creature seems to be nothing but a patch of mobile gloom, more or
less humanoid in shape.
Shadows are creatures of sentient darkness, hating life and light
with equal fervor. Their touch bestows the painful chill of nonexistence, making them very dangerous opponents.
A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but
stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places.
Natural enemies of all that live, shadows are aggressive and
predatory. They are quick to strike and make short work of those
unprepared to deal with them.
A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is weightless.
Shadows cannot speak intelligibly.
COMBAT
Shadows lurk in dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by.
Strength Damage (Su): The touch of a shadow deals 1d6 points
of Strength damage to a living foe. A creature reduced to Strength
0 by a shadow dies. This is a negative energy effect.

*A shadow gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in areas of
shadowy illumination. In brightly lit areas, it takes a –4 penalty
on Hide checks.
GREATER SHADOW
Although no more intelligent than an average shadow, a
greater shadow is more fearsome because of its
increased damage and its hit-and-run tactics.
Combat
A greater shadow uses stealth and
cunning in combat. A favorite
tactic is to lie in wait, almost completely concealed by walls or floor, then swoop out, make an
incorporeal touch attack, and retreat back into a solid object
without allowing a return attack.
Strength Damage (Su): The touch of a greater shadow
deals 1d8 points of Strength damage to a living foe.

This creature has the body of a large dog, with a smooth
black coat and a mouth full of sharp teeth.
Shadow mastiffs are great hounds
that prowl the night, seeking
any prey they can find. Their
native plane is a place of
eternal shadow.
A shadow
mastiff is
slightly more
than 2 feet high at
the shoulder and
weighs about 200 pounds.
Shadow mastiffs cannot speak, but they understand Common.
COMBAT
Shadow mastiffs prefer fighting in shadows or dark
conditions, which gives them a great advantage.
If a magical light source negates the shadows around them, shadow mastiffs are
cunning enough to either move out of
the light or back off and break up the
opposition with their baying. They have
been known to seize and carry off items
enspelled with daylight spells.
Bay (Su): When a shadow mastiff howls
or barks, all creatures except evil outsiders
within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a
DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4
rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear
effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an
affected creature is immune to the same mastiff ’s bay for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Trip (Ex): A shadow mastiff that hits with
its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent
as a free action (+3 check modifier) without
making a touch attack or provoking an attack of
opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent
cannot react to trip the shadow mastiff.
Shadow Blend (Su): In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow mastiff can
disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment. Artificial illumination, even a light or continual
flame spell, does not negate this ability. A daylight spell,
however, will.
Skills: *A shadow mastiff has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

SHADOW
MASTIFF
Illus. by S. Wood
Shadow
222 Shadow mastiff
This creature looks like a mass of leaves and vines with a generally humanlike form. It has a barrel-shaped body with ropy arms and stumpy legs. It
doesn’t seem to have a head.
Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, appear to be heaps of
rotting vegetation. They are actually intelligent, carnivorous
plants.
A shambler’s brain and sensory organs are located in its upper
body.
A shambler is almost totally silent and invisible in its natural
surroundings, often catching opponents flat-footed. It may lie partially submerged in a shallow bog, waiting patiently for some creature to walk onto it. Shamblers move easily through water as well,
and they have been known to sneak into the camps of unsuspecting travelers at night.
Adventurers tell stories of shamblers moving about during
intense electrical storms without so much as flinching from direct
lightning strikes.
A shambler’s body has an 8-foot girth and is about 6 feet tall
when the creature stands erect. It weighs about 3,800 pounds.
COMBAT
A shambling mound batters or constricts its opponents with two
huge, armlike appendages.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a shambler must hit
with both slam attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins
the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Constrict (Ex): A shambler deals 2d6+7 points of damage with
a successful grapple check.
Immunity to Electricity (Ex): Shamblers take no damage
from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack (such as shocking
grasp orlightning bolt) used against a shambler temporarily grants it
1d4 points of Constitution. The shambler loses these points at the
rate of 1 per hour.
Skills: Shamblers have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and
Move Silently checks. *They have a +12 racial bonus on Hide
checks when in a swampy or forested area.

SHIELD
GUARDIAN
Shambine mound
Shield guardian
223
This massive conglomeration of stone, wood, and metal is the size of an
ogre and resembles a giant stick figure with stony appendages.
Created by spellcasters to be bodyguards, shield guardians are constructs that protect their masters with spells and stamina.
When it is fashioned, a shield guardian is keyed to a particular
magical amulet. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet
to be its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so).
A shield guardian obeys its master’s verbal commands to the
best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat
and possibly simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform
specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met.
The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.
A shield guardian is some 9 feet tall and weighs more than
1,200 pounds.
Shield guardians cannot speak, but they understand commands
given in any language.
COMBAT
Shield guardians are straightforward in battle, bashing with their
heavy stone fists. They are made for defense and are not particularly impressive on offense.
Find Master (Su): As long as a shield guardian and its amulet
are on the same plane, the shield guardian can find the amulet
wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is
called).
Guard (Ex): If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves swiftly
to defend the wearer of its amulet, blocking blows and disrupting
foes. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a –2 penalty when
the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.
Shield Other (Sp): The wearer of a shield guardian’s amulet can
activate this defensive
ability if within 100 feet
of the shield guardian.
Just as the spell of the
same name, this ability
transfers to the shield
guardian half the damage that would be dealt
to the amulet wearer
(this ability does not
provide the spell’s AC or
save bonuses).
Spell Storing (Sp): A
shield guardian can
store one spell of 4th
level or lower that is cast
into it by another creature. It “casts” this spell
when commanded to do
so or when a predefined
situation arises. Once
this spell is used, the
shield guardian can
store another spell (or
the same spell again).
CONSTRUCTION
A shield guardian is
built from wood, bronze,
stone, and steel. The
materials cost 5,000 gp.
The creature’s master
may assemble the body
or hire someone else to
do the job. Creating the body requires a DC 16 Craft (blacksmithing) or Craft (carpentry) check. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time, and its cost (20,000 gp) is included in the
cost of the guardian. After the body is sculpted, the shield
guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an
alchemist’s laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature’s body, the building
and the ritual can be performed together.
A shield guardian with more than 15 Hit Dice can be created,
but each additional Hit Die adds +5,000 gp to the market price,
and the price increases by +20,000 gp if the creature’s size increases
to Huge, modifying the cost to create accordingly.
CL 15th; Craft Construct (see page 303), limited wish, discern location, shield, shield other, caster must be at least 15th level; Price
120,000 gp; Cost 65,000 gp + 4,600 XP.
AMULET
If a shield guardian’s amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to
function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the
amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command
it was given.

This little lizard is about the size of a terrier, It has
a bullet-shaped head sporting a large pair of horns that
sweep back from the sides like spiky ears. A similar structure appears on the tip of the tail.
The shocker lizard is a sleek reptilelike creature whose body
can generate intense electrical shocks.
A shocker lizard has a pale gray or blue underside, shading
to a darker hue on its back. It has blue-black markings
along its back and tail.
Shocker lizards prefer warm and damp
conditions, and often lurk in swamps,
shaded riverbanks, and water-filled
caves. They hunt fish, reptiles, and
small animals, but also scavenge or take
larger prey from time to time. They spend most
of their time hiding and waiting for prey to
happen by.
A shocker lizard is about 1 foot tall at the shoulder
and weighs about 25 pounds.
COMBAT
Unless it is very hungry, a shocker lizard dislikes fighting creatures larger than itself and usually tries to
warn off intruders by emitting a series of rapid
clicks. The sound is actually a lowpower electrical discharge, and
living creatures within 10 feet
can feel the current tickling their skins and
scalps. If the warning fails,
the lizard raises its horns and tail to administer stunning shocks.
A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat. A
lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent
unconscious or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A
solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker
lizards are nearby, they all home in on their comrade’s discharges
and attempt to administer their shocks to the foe.
Stunning Shock (Su): Once per round, a shocker lizard can
deliver an electrical shock to a single opponent within 5 feet. This
attack deals 2d8 points of nonlethal damage to living opponents
(Reflex DC 12 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Lethal Shock (Su): Whenever two or more shocker lizards
are within 20 feet of each other, they can work together to create
a lethal shock. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any
one contributing lizard. The shock deals 2d8 points of electricity
damage for each lizard contributing to it, to a maximum of 12d8.
A Reflex save (DC 10 + number of lizards contributing) reduces
the damage by half.
Electricity Sense (Ex): Shocker lizards automatically detect
any electrical discharges within 100 feet.
Skills: Shocker lizards have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks
due to their coloration. Shocker lizards have a +2 racial bonus on
Listen and Spot checks.
Shocker lizards use their Dexterity modifier instead of their
Strength modifier for Climb and Jump checks.
A shocker lizard has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or
threatened.
A shocker lizard has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
SKELETON
This creature appears to be nothing
but a set of animated bones. Pinpoints of red light smolder in its
empty eye sockets.
Skeletons are the animated
bones of the dead, mindless
automatons that obey the
orders of their evil masters.
A skeleton is seldom
garbed in anything more
than the rotting remnants
of any clothing or armor it
was wearing when slain.
A skeleton does only what it
is ordered to do. It can draw no
conclusions of its own and takes no
initiative. Because of this limitation,
its instructions must always be
simple, such as “Kill anyone
who enters this chamber.”
A skeleton attacks
until destroyed, for
that is what it
was created to
do. The threat
posed by a
group of
skeletons depends
primarily on its size.
CREATING A SKELETON
“Skeleton” is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system
(referred to hereafter as the base creature).
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes to undead. It
retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good)
and subtypes that indicate kind (such as goblinoid or reptilian).
It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from class levels (to a
minimum of 1) and raise remaining Hit Dice to d12s. If the creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can’t be made into a skeleton

Armor Class: Natural armor bonus changes to a number based
on the skeleton’s size:
Tiny or smaller +0
Small +1
Medium or Large +2
Huge +3
Gargantuan +6
Colossal +10
Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can’t work without flesh (such as a
mind flayer’s tentacle attacks). A creature with hands gains one
claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw
attacks at its full attack bonus. A skeleton’s base attack bonus is
equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice.
Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton’s
size. (If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands,
use the skeleton claw damage only if it’s better.)
Diminutive or Fine 1
Tiny 1d2
Small 1d3
Medium 1d4
Large 1d6
Huge 1d8
Gargantuan 2d6
Colossal 2d8
Special Attacks: A skeleton retains none of the base creature’s
special attacks.

the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that
improve its melee or ranged attacks. A skeleton gains the following special qualities.
Immunity to Cold (Ex): Skeletons are not affected by cold.
Damage Reduction 5/Bludgeoning: Skeletons lack flesh or internal
organs.
Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and
Will +1/2 HD + 2.
Abilities: A skeleton’s Dexterity increases by +2, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its
Charisma changes to 1.
Skills: A skeleton has no skills.
Feats: A skeleton loses all feats of the base creature and gains
Improved Initiative.
Environment: Any, usually same as base creature.

This creature looks like an
abominable crossbreed of
human and fish. Its fins
have grown into twisted arms
and legs, and its bent back is crowned with a long,
spiny frill. It has a slender, muscular tail and bulbous eyes.
Skum are misbegotten creatures created by aboleths to serve as
beasts of burden and slaves. They are derived from human stock,
making them even more loathsome.
A skum is about the same height and weight as a human.
Skum speak Aquan.
COMBAT
In the water, skum are dangerous enemies who attack by biting,
clawing, and raking with their rear legs. Skum serving an aboleth
are sometimes trained to fight with weapons, usually two-handed
melee weapons with reach (such as longspears) and simple ranged
weapons such as javelins, tridents, or slings.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +0 melee, damage 1d6+2. A skum also
gains two rake attacks when it attacks while swimming.
Skills: *Skum have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot
checks underwater.
A skum has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take
10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight
line.
SLAAD
The chaotic planes seethe and roil with random energy and bits of
matter. Weaving their way amid this cacophony of light and sound
are the slaadi.
Creatures of chaos, slaadi have been likened to humanoid toads,
but that description belies their agility and fearsome fighting
prowess.
All slaadi speak their own language, Slaad. Green, gray, and
death slaadi also speak Common, and in addition death slaadi
can communicate telepathically.
COMBAT
Slaadi generally attack with their claws and
bite. They relish melee combat but are savvy
enough to use their summoning and other
spell-like abilities to good effect. A slaad’s
natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned
for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
All slaadi have resistance to acid 5,
cold 5, electricity 5, and fire 5, and
immunity to sonic damage.
Summon Slaad (Sp): Slaadi can
summon other slaadi much as
though casting a summon monster spell, but they have only a
limited chance of success. Roll
d%: On a failure, no slaadi
answer the summons. Summoned creatures automatically
return whence they came after
1 hour. A slaad that has just
been summoned cannot use its
own summon ability for 1
hour.
Most slaadi do not use this
ability lightly, since they are
generally distrustful and fearful of one another. In general,
they use it only when necessary
to save their own lives.
SLAADI CHARACTERS
Slaadi rarely have the focus to devote themselves to a character
class. Grays sometimes become sorcerers, and the most powerful
death slaadi train as rogues to take the assassin class.

This creature looks like a roughly humanoid, red-skinned toad with almost
no neck and a massive, flat head. It is bipedal, with clawed hands and
feet. The hands and the digits on them are particularly large. A human
would stand only about as high as the creature’s shoulders.
Weakest of the slaadi, the reds wander about individually, often establishing secret lairs on
other planes. Most seek to escape from
the other more powerful and sometimes cruel slaadi.
A red slaad is about 8 feet tall
and weighs about 650 pounds.
As its name suggests, a red
slaad is mostly red, darker
along the back and paler
around the belly.
Red slaadi are found in
groups only when working
for some greater power that
somehow has mastered
them. Even then, they
don’t coordinate actions
well.
Combat
Red slaadi usually attack
only when hungry or
riled. Once aroused,
however, a red slaad
fights to the death.
Pounce (Ex): If a
red slaad charges, it
can make a full
attack in the same
round.
Implant (Ex): A
red slaad that hits
with a claw attack can
inject an egg pellet into
the opponent’s body. The
affected creature must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save to
avoid implantation. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Often the slaad implants an unconscious or otherwise helpless
creature (which gets no saving throw). The egg gestates for one
week before hatching into a blue slaad that eats its way out, killing
the host. Twenty-four hours before the egg fully matures, the
victim falls extremely ill (–10 to all ability scores, to a minimum of
1). A remove disease spell rids a victim of the pellet, as does a DC 25
Heal check. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each
attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the
patient.
If the host is an arcane spellcaster, the egg pellet instead hatches
into a green slaad.
Stunning Croak (Su): Once per day a red slaad can emit a loud
croak. Every creature (except slaadi) within 20 feet must succeed
on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Summon Slaad (Sp): Once per day a red slaad can attempt to
summon another red slaad with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

This hulking creature
looks like a strapping
blue-skinned humanoid
toad, as big as an ogre, with almost no neck
and a massive, flat head. It is bipedal, with clawed hands and feet. It has
wicked-looking, bony hooks on the backs of its hands.
Blue slaadi gather to wage horrific battles against other societies
and their own. They are bullies that value only strength and
power.
A blue slaad is about 10 feet tall and very broad. It weighs about
1,000 pounds. As its name suggests, a blue slaad is mostly blue,
darker along the back and paler around the belly.
Blue slaadi are most often found in groups and work well
together—at least, better than red slaadi.
SLAAD
Blue Slaad
Death slaad

Combat
Blue slaadi are quick to anger, and inclined to attack most other
creatures on sight to prove their strength. The bone hooks on the
backs of its hands give a blue slaad four claw attacks each round
when it makes a full attack.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—hold person (DC 13), passwall, telekinesis (DC 15); 1/day—chaos hammer (DC 14). Caster level 8th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Slaad Fever (Su): Supernatural disease—bite, Fortitude DC 18,
incubation period 1 day, damage 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Cha. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
An afflicted humanoid reduced to Charisma 0 by slaad fever
immediately transforms into a red slaad. It retains none of the features, traits, memories, or abilities of its
former self, and is a normal red
slaad in all respects.
If the infected being is an
arcane spellcaster, the disease
instead produces a green slaad.

This tall, gangly creature looks like a cross between an ogre and a frog. Its
skin is a mottled green, and it has long, sharp claws and a wide mouth.
If a red slaad’s egg pellet or a blue slaad’s disease infects an arcane
spellcaster, that host produces a green slaad.
A green slaad is about 10 feet tall and very broad. It weighs
about 1,000 pounds. As its name suggests, a green slaad is mostly
green, darker along the back and paler around the belly.
Green slaadi are self-centered, arrogant louts that think only of
themselves. They lust after magical power, eventually transforming into grays (see below) if they find it.
Green slaadi work in groups if
doing so suits their immediate
needs.
Combat
Green slaadi prefer to use
spell-like abilities over physical
combat but aren’t afraid to attack
with tooth and claw if they must.
They never fight to the death,
though, if they can avoid it.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—
chaos hammer (DC 15), detect magic,
detect thoughts (DC 13), fear (DC 15),
protection from law, see invisibility,
shatter (DC 13); 3/day—
dispel law (DC 16), deeper
darkness, fireball (DC 14). Caster
level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su): A green can assume any Medium or
Large humanoid form as a standard action. In humanoid form, a
green slaad cannot use its natural weapons (although a slaad can
equip itself with weapons and armor appropriate to its appearance). A green slaad remains in one form until it chooses to
assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the
slaad reverts to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell
reveals its natural form.
Summon Slaad (Sp): Twice per day a green slaad can attempt to
summon another green slaad with a 40% chance of success. This
ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.

Lean and quick-looking, this humanoid resembles a two-legged frog. Its
skin is a dappled gray color, and its fingers are long and clawed. It stands
as tall as a human.
A green slaad that survives for more than a century retreats into
isolation for at least a year. It returns as a smaller, leaner gray slaad
and devotes most of its time and attention to magical study. Gray
slaadi enjoy crafting magic items to further their own power.
Combat
Gray slaadi prefer to fight from a distance, using their spell-like
abilities, although they don’t shy away from melee.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—chaos hammer (DC 16), deeper

Summon Slaad (Sp): Twice per day a gray slaad can attempt to

Lean and quick-looking, this humanoid resembles a two-legged frog. Its
skin is a dappled gray color, and its fingers are long and clawed. It stands
as tall as a human.
Death slaadi are grays that undergo some mysterious ritual that
transforms them into veritable killing machines. Although they
have spell-like abilities like gray slaadi, death slaadi focus more on
killing than on magical power. They look exactly like gray slaadi.
All slaadi obey the command of a death slaad, out of fear more
than anything else. Death slaadi represent a corruption of pure
chaos by evil rather than true exemplars of it.
Combat
Although its prowess with its natural weapons is fearsome, a death
slaad enjoys wielding a magic weapon if available.
Stun (Ex): Three times per day, a death slaad can attempt to
stun its opponent on an attack with one of its natural weapons. If
the opponent fails a DC 21 Fortitude save, it is stunned for 1 round
in addition to taking normal damage from the attack. The save DC
is Wisdom-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—animate objects, chaos hammer
(DC 18), deeper darkness, detect magic, dispel law (DC 19), fear (DC 18),
finger of death (DC 21), fireball (DC 17), fly, identify, invisibility, magic
circle against law, see invisibility, shatter (DC 16); 3/day—circle of death
(DC 20), cloak of chaos (DC 22), word of chaos (DC 21); 1/day—implosion (DC 23), power word blind. Caster level 15th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su): A death slaad can assume any humanoid
form as a standard action. In humanoid form, a death slaad cannot
use its natural weapons (although a slaad can equip itself with
weapons and armor appropriate to its appearance). A death slaad
remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A
change in form cannot be dispelled, but the slaad reverts to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell reveals its natural form.
Summon Slaad (Sp): Twice per day a death slaad can attempt to
summon 1–2 red or blue slaadi with a 60% chance of success, or
1–2 green slaadi with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the
equivalent of a 6th-level spell.

This entity looks like a human,
but with a diaphanous and faintly luminous body.
Spectres are incorporeal undead often mistaken for
ghosts. They haunt the places
where they died, retaining their
sentience but now hating all living
things.
A spectre looks much as it did in life
and can be easily recognized by those who
knew the individual or have seen the individual’s face in a painting or a drawing. In many cases, the
evidence of a violent death is visible on its body. The chill of death
lingers in the air around spectres and in the places they haunt.
A spectre is roughly human-sized and is weightless.
COMBAT
In close combat a spectre attacks with its numbing, life-draining
touch. It makes full use of its incorporeal nature, moving through
walls, ceilings, and floors as it attacks.
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a spectre’s incorporeal touch attack gain two negative levels. The DC is 15 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charismabased. For each such negative level bestowed, the spectre gains 5
temporary hit points.
Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a spectre becomes
a spectre in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the
spectre that created them and remain enslaved until its death.
They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Unnatural Aura (Su): Animals, whether wild or domesticated,
can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30
feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if
forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within
that range.
Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A spectre
caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move
or attack action in a round.
SPHINX
Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and
leonine bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but the more intelligent ones can differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent trespass.
A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800
pounds.
Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.
Combat
Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help
them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound
creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.
Pounce (Ex): If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a
full attack, including two rake attacks.
Rake (Ex): A sphinx that pounces onto a
creature can make two rake attacks with its
hind legs. Each sphinx’s description provides its attack bonus and damage.

This creature is bigger than a riding horse and has a tawny lion body, great
falcon wings, and a humanoid face.
These sphinxes are always male. Androsphinxes are clever and
generally good-natured, but they can be savage opponents.
Though outwardly gruff and bad-tempered, androsphinxes
have noble hearts, and are a little bit shy. They appreciate small
courtesies, but seldom admit it, and praise makes them feel
uncomfortable.
SPECTRE

Combat
In battle, an androsphinx rips apart enemies with its razor-sharp
claws. It relies on its natural weapons in a fight, employing its
spells for defense or healing.
Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +18 melee, damage 2d4+3.
Roar (Su): Three times per day an androsphinx can loose a
mighty roar. The first time it does this, all creatures within 500 feet
must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by a
fear spell for 2d6 rounds.
If the sphinx roars a second time during the same encounter, all
creatures within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save
or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, and all those within 90 feet are
deafened for 2d6 rounds (no save).
If it roars a third time during the same encounter, all those within
250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points
of Strength damage for 2d4 rounds. In addition, any Medium or
smaller creature within 90 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be thrown to the ground and take 2d8 points of
damage. The force of this roar is so great that it deals 50 points
of damage to any stone or
crystalline object within
90 feet. Magic items and
held or carried items can avoid
damage with a DC 19 Reflex save.
Other androsphinxes are immune
to these effects. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spells: An androsphinx casts divine
spells as a 6th-level
cleric from the
cleric spell list and
from the Good, Healing,
and Protection domains.
Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (5/5/5/4; save DC 13 + spell level):
0—cure minor wounds, detect magic, guidance, light,

This creature is bigger than a horse and has a tawny lion body, great

These sphinxes are always male. Neither good nor evil, they lack
the intelligence of the androsphinx.
Criosphinxes constantly seek gynosphinxes, but if they cannot
find one, they pursue wealth above all else. The best deal an adventurer can hope to strike with a criosphinx is safe passage in exchange for all of his or her treasure.
Combat
Criosphinxes
attack with their
claws, as do their kin, but
they can also butt with their
horns. They don’t cast spells and
employ only the most simple battle tactics.

This creature is bigger than a horse and has a tawny lion body, great
falcon wings, and the head of a female humanoid.
These sphinxes are the female counterparts of androsphinxes.
Gynosphinxes often are willing to bargain for treasure or service. They constantly seek out new intellectual challenges—riddles, puzzles, and other such tests delight them to no end. They
find criosphinxes and hieracosphinxes detestable.
Combat
In close combat, gynosphinxes use their powerful claws to flay the
flesh from their enemies. Despite their deadly nature, they prefer
to avoid combat whenever possible.

This beast resembles an enormous, two-legged hornet
with a pair of small forelimbs and huge bat wings.
A spider eater has a temperament that
matches its nasty appearance. Nevertheless,
these predators are valued as flying steeds. A company of bandits mounted on spider eaters is fearsome indeed. The creature gets its name from
its ability to shrug off webs and its habit of laying
eggs in the paralyzed bodies of enormous creatures,
often arachnids.
A spider eater is about 10 feet long and 4 feet high,
and has a wingspan of about 20 feet. It weighs about
4,000 pounds.
COMBAT
A spider eater attacks with its venomous sting and
powerful mandibles. Its usual tactic is to deliver a
sting, then back off, hovering out of reach until the
venom takes effect. Spider eaters do not like to give up
their prey, and foes who harry them with spells or
ranged attacks provoke a determined counterattack.
Implant (Ex): Female spider eaters lay their eggs inside
paralyzed creatures of Large or larger size. The young emerge
about six weeks later, literally devouring the host from inside.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial damage none, secondary damage paralysis for 1d8+5 weeks. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Freedom of Movement (Su): Spider eaters have a continuous
freedom of movement ability as the spell (caster level 12th). When
the spider eater serves as a mount, this effect does not extend to its
rider.
Skills: Spider eaters have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.
TRAINING A SPIDER EATER
A spider eater requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. Training a spider eater requires six weeks of work and a DC 25
Handle Animal check. Riding a spider eater requires an exotic
saddle. A spider eater can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider
cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
Spider eater eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market,
while young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge
3,000 gp to rear or train a spider eater.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a spider eater is up to 306
pounds; a medium load, 307–612 pounds; and a heavy load,
613–920 pounds.

This being looks something like a small elf. It has green skin, webbed
fingers and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver eyes.
Nixies are aquatic sprites who dwell in and protect pristine ponds
and lakes. They are even more reclusive than most fey and tend to
treat intruders with suspicion and hostility.
Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green
skin and dark green hair. Females often twine shells and pearl
strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Males wear loincloths of the same materials. Nixies prefer
not to leave their lakes.
A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.
Nixies speak Aquan and Sylvan. Some also speak Common.
Combat
Nixies rely on their charm person ability to deter enemies, entering
combat only to protect themselves and their territory.
Charm Person (Sp): A nixie can use charm person three times per
day as the spell (caster level 4th). Those affected must succeed on
a DC 15 Will save or be charmed for 24 hours. Most charmed crea-

tures are used to perform heavy labor, guard duty, and other onerous tasks for the nixie community. Shortly before the effect wears
off, the nixie escorts the charmed creature away and orders it to
keep walking. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Amphibious (Ex): Although nixies are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.
Water Breathing (Sp): Once per day a nixie can use water breathing as the spell (caster level 12th). Nixies usually bestow this effect
on those they have charmed.
Wild Empathy (Ex): This ability works like the druid’s wild
empathy class feature, except that a nixie has a +6 racial bonus on
the check.
Skills: A nixie has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can
use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a
straight line.
*Nixies have a +5 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the
water.

This being resembles a very small elf, but with longer ears and gossamer
wings.
Pixies are merry pranksters that love to lead travelers astray. They
can, however, be roused to surprising ire when dealing with evil
creatures.
These sprites love to trick misers out of their wealth. They do
not covet treasure themselves but use it to taunt and frustrate
greedy folk. If a victim of pixie pranks exhibits no greed or
demonstrates a good sense of humor, the tricksters may allow the
individual to choose a reward from their hoard.
Pixies wear bright clothing, often including a cap and shoes
with curled and pointed toes.
A pixie stands about 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.
Pixies speak Sylvan and Common, and may know other languages as well.
Combat
The normally carefree pixies ferociously attack evil creatures and
unwanted intruders. They take full advantage of their invisibility

This nasty-looking creature seems to be a cross between a bat and a giant
mosquito. It has membranous bat wings, a short furry body, eight jointed
legs that end in sharp pincers, and a needlelike proboscis.
Stirges are batlike creatures that feed on the blood of living beings.
While just one
poses little danger
to most adventurers,
multiple stirges can be a formidable threat.
A stirge’s coloration ranges from
rust-red to reddish-brown, with a
dirty yellow underside. The
proboscis is pink
at the tip, fading to
gray at its base.
A stirge’s body is about 1 foot
long, with a wingspan of about 2
feet. It weighs about 1 pound.
COMBAT
A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, finding a vulnerable spot, and plunging its proboscis
into the flesh. This is a touch attack and can target only
Small or larger creatures.
Attach (Ex): If a stirge hits with a touch attack, it uses its
eight pincers to latch onto the opponent’s body. An
attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The
stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC
of 12, but holds on with great tenacity. Stirges have a +12
racial bonus on grapple checks (already figured into the Base
Attack/Grapple entry above).
An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled
itself. To remove an attached stirge through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the stirge.
Blood Drain (Ex): A stirge drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
Constitution damage in any round when it begins its turn
attached to a victim. Once it has dealt 4 points of Constitution
damage, it detaches and flies off to digest the meal. If its victim
dies before the stirge’s appetite has been sated, the stirge detaches
and seeks a new target.
SWARM
Swarms are dense masses of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures
that would not be particularly dangerous in small groups, but
can be terrible foes when gathered in sufficient numbers. While
a single cloud of locusts might actually be hundreds of feet
across, for game purposes a swarm is defined as a single creature
with a space of 10 feet—gigantic hordes of bats or locusts are
actually composed of dozens of swarms in close proximity. A
swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. It
makes saving throws as a single creature.
Many different creatures can mass as swarms; bat swarms,
centipede swarms, hellwasp swarms, locust swarms, rat swarms,
and spider swarms are described here. The swarm’s type varies
with the nature of the component creature (most are animals or
vermin), but all swarms have the swarm subtype.
A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or
1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists
of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of
Fine creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying
or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their
normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly
together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when
moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples
of single swarms. A large swarm is completely shapeable, though
it usually remains contiguous.
COMBAT
In order to attack, a single swarm moves into opponents’ spaces,
which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same
space as a creature of any size,
since it crawls all over its prey, but
remains a creature with a 10-foot
space. Swarms never make attacks
of opportunity, but they can provoke attacks of opportunity.
Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot
space, a swarm is shapeable. It can occupy any
four contiguous squares, and it can squeeze
through any space large enough to contain one
of its component creatures (for example, a bat
swarm can squeeze through a space that a Tiny
creature could squeeze through).
Vulnerabilities of Swarms
Swarms are extremely difficult to fight with physical
attacks. However, they have a few special vulnerabilities, as follows:
A lit torch swung as an improvised weapon
deals 1d3 points of fire damage per hit.
A weapon with a special ability such as flaming or frost deals its full energy damage with
each hit, even if the weapon’s normal
damage can’t affect the swarm.
A lit lantern can be used as a thrown weapon, dealing 1d4 points
of fire damage to all creatures in squares adjacent to where it breaks.

A bat swarm is nocturnal, and is never found aboveground in
daylight.
Combat
A bat swarm seeks to surround and attack any warm-blooded prey
it encounters. The swarm deals 1d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move.
Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that begins its turn with
a swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or be
nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Wounding (Ex): Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm
continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a
cure spell or some other healing magic.
Blindsense (Ex): A bat swarm notices and locates creatures
within 20 feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the
bat swarm (but swarm attacks ignore concealment).
Skills: A bat swarm has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsense is negated.

An angry buzz fills the air around a darting cloud of thousands of ruby-red
insects.
Hellwasps are vicious, foul-tempered magical insects from the
infernal planes. A single hellwasp resembles a thumb -sized
normal wasp, except its carapace is gleaming black with ruby-red
stripes, and its compound eyes are an iridescent green. In swarms,
hellwasps form a collective hive mind intelligence with infernal
cunning and bloodlust.
Combat
Like any swarm, a hellwasp swarm seeks to surround and attack
any living prey it encounters. A swarm deals 3d6 points of damage
to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move. The
swarm can take over the bodies of its prey and infest both the living and the dead, using them as horrible living (or unliving) puppets to accomplish acts of wickedness that a swarm of insects
could never attempt.
A hellwasp swarm’s attack is treated as an evil-aligned weapon and
a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that begins its turn with a
hellwasp swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save
or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Inhabit (Ex): A hellwasp swarm can enter the body of a helpless or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices.
Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small,
Medium, or Large (although four swarms working together can
SWARM
238
inhabit a Huge creature). The swarm can abandon the body at any
time, although doing this takes 1 full round. Any attack against
the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well,
although the swarm’s resistances and immunities may negate
some or all of this damage.
If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can restore animation to the creature and control its movements, effectively transforming it into a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the
swarm remains inside. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living
victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control
the victim’s movement and actions as if using dominate monster on
the victim. The hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing
2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour they inhabit a body. A
body reduced to Constitution 0 is dead.
A hellwasp-inhabited creature is relatively easy to spot, since its
skin crawls with the forms of insects inside. The swarm is intelligent enough to attempt to hide beneath loose clothing or a large
cloak to keep its presence from being detected. The swarm can
attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with
a –4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host.
A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces
the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial and secondary
damage 1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Hive Mind (Ex): Any hellwasp swarm with at least 1 hit point
per Hit Die (or 12 hit points, for a standard hellwasp swarm) forms
a hive mind, giving it an Intelligence of 6. When a hellwasp swarm
is reduced below this hit point threshold, it becomes mindless.

This scaly biped seems about as tall as a five-story building. It carries itself
like a bird of prey, leaning well forward and using its powerful, lashing tail
for balance. It has two horns on its head and a thick, reflective carapace
on its back.
The legendary tarrasque—fortunately, only one exists—is possibly the most dreaded monster of all (except for the largest dragons). None can predict where and when the creature will strike
next.
The location of the tarrasque’s lair is a mystery, and the beast
remains dormant much of the time. Its torporous slumber usually
lasts 6d4 months before it leaves its lair for a brief hunting foray
lasting 1d3 days. Once every decade or so, the monster is particularly active, staying awake for 1d2 weeks. Thereafter, it slumbers
for at least 4d6 years unless disturbed.
When active, the tarrasque is a perfect engine of destruction. It
rampages across the land eating everything in its path, including
plants, animals, humanoids, and even towns. Nothing is safe, and
entire communities prefer to flee the ravening tarrasque rather
than face its power.
Many legends surround the tarrasque’s origins and purpose.
Some hold it to be an abomination unleashed by ancient, forgotten
gods to punish all of nature, while others tell of a conspiracy between evil wizards or merciless elemental powers. These tales are
mere speculation, however, and the creature’s true nature will probably remain a mystery. The tarrasque isn’t in the habit of explaining
itself, and it rarely leaves any living witnesses in its wake.
The tarrasque is 70 feet long and 50 feet tall, and it
weighs about 130 tons.
The tarrasque cannot speak.
TARRASQUE
Illus. by C. Critchlow
Tarrasque
240
COMBAT
The tarrasque attacks with its claws, teeth, horns, and tail.
The tarrasque’s natural weapons are treated as epic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Augmented Critical (Ex): The tarrasque’s bite threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 18–20, dealing triple damage on
a successful critical hit.
Frightful Presence (Su): The tarrasque can inspire terror by
charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC
36 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition
as long as they remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The
save DC is Charisma-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the
tarrasque must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
can try to swallow the foe the following round.
Rush (Ex): Once per minute, the
normally slow-moving tarrasque
can move at a speed of 150 feet.
Swallow Whole (Ex): The
tarrasque can try to swallow a
grabbed opponent of Huge or
smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once
inside, the opponent takes
2d8+8 points of crushing
damage plus 2d8+6 points of
acid damage per round from
the tarrasque’s digestive
juices. A swallowed creature
can cut its way out by dealing
50 points of damage to the tarrasque’s digestive tract (AC 25).
Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another
swallowed opponent must cut its
own way out.
The tarrasque’s gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128
Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures.
Carapace (Ex):The tarrasque’s armorlike carapace is exceptionally
tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even
magic missile spells. There is a 30% chance of reflecting any such
effect back at the caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for
reflection before rolling to overcome the creature’s spell resistance.
Regeneration (Ex): No form of attack deals lethal damage to
the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving
throw against a disintegrate spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque
fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly
(such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals
nonlethal damage equal to the creature’s full normal hit points +10
(or 868 hp). The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the
wounding special ability, or a clay golem’s cursed wound ability.
The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage
total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hit points) and using
a wish or miracle spell to keep it dead.
If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by
holding it to the stump.
Skills: The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

This creature looks like a mound
of vegetation supported by vines
and branches. The mass has a huge
opening filled with “teeth” of
sharp branches and long thorns.
The tendriculos is a plant that may have been mutated by foul
magic, or may have originated on another plane of existence—or
possibly both of these theories are true.
A tendriculos can rear up to a height of 15 feet. It weighs about
3,500 pounds.
The tendriculos is best known for its ability to grow and regrow
its vegetable body extremely rapidly. Whole new leaves and vines
appear in just a few minutes. A tendriculos accomplishes this by
consuming vast quantities of meat.
Animals and other plant creatures are unnerved by the presence
of a tendriculos; they avoid it and any place it has been within the
last 24 hours.
COMBAT
Prowling deep forests or waiting in vegetated areas (looking like
nothing more than a small hillock), a tendriculos attacks savagely,
showing no fear. It attempts to swallow as much flesh as it can, as
quickly as it can.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tendriculos must hit a
creature at least one size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can
then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round.
A tendriculos can also use its improved grab ability on a tendril

attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up
the opponent, and transfers it to the mouth as a free
action, automatically dealing bite damage.
Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex): A tendriculos can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent by making a successful grapple
check. Once inside the plant’s mass,
the opponent must succeed on a DC
20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed
for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos’s digestive juices, taking 2d6
points of acid damage per
round. A new save is required each round
inside the plant. The save DC is Constitution-based.
A swallowed creature that avoids paralysis can climb out of the
mass with a successful grapple check. This returns it to the plant’s
maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get
free. A swallowed creature can also cut its way out by using a light
slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the tendriculos’s interior (AC 14). Once the creature exits, the plant’s
regenerative capacity closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.
A Huge tendriculos’s interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32
Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents.
Regeneration (Ex): Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal
normal damage to a tendriculos.
A tendriculos that loses part of its body mass can regrow it in
1d6 minutes. Holding the severed portion against the mass
enables it to reattach instantly.

This creature has a sinuous body that is
segmented like an earthworm’s. The whole body
glows with orange-white heat.
The thoqqua is a wormlike monster with a
body hot enough to melt solid rock. It has a
choleric mood and a foul temper. Although native to the
Elemental Plane of Fire, it is also known to inhabit the Elemental
Plane of Earth.
A thoqqua spends most of its time burrowing through rock looking for minerals to eat. It burrowing leaves behind a
usable tunnel, albeit a small one with
blistering hot walls.
A thoqqua is about 1 foot in
diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. It
weighs about 200 pounds.
COMBAT
When a thoqqua is disturbed, its first instinct
is to attack. Its favored tactic is to spring
directly at a foe, either by bursting out of the
rock or by coiling up its body and launching itself
like a spring. (Treat this as a charge, even though the thoqqua does
not need to move 10 feet before attacking.)
Heat (Ex): Merely touching or being touched by a thoqqua
automatically deals 2d6 fire damage.
Burn (Ex): When a thoqqua hits with its slam attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or catch fire. The save
DC is Constitution-based. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds if not
extinguished sooner. A burning creature can use a full-round
action to put out the flame (see Catching on Fire, page 303 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide).

This being looks like a giant-sized human of great physical strength and
beauty. It carries an enormous warhammer. It seems very lively and selfassured.
Titans are statuesque beings of heroic proportions. They have agile
minds and powerful bodies. Many come from the plane of
Arborea.
Titans favor heavy armor crafted in ancient designs. They wear
rare and valuable jewelry and generally make themselves seem
beautiful and overpowering.
Titans are wild and chaotic, masters of their own fates. They are
closer to the wellsprings of life than mere mortals and so revel in
existence. They are prone to more pronounced emotions than humans and can experience deitylike fits of rage. Many titans are
powerful servants of good, but in ages past the race of titans rebelled against the deities themselves, and a number of titans
turned to evil. An evil titan is an indomitable tyrant who often
masters entire kingdoms of mortals.
A titan is about 25 feet tall and weighs about 14,000 pounds.
Titans speak Abyssal, Common, Celestial, Draconic, and Giant.
COMBAT
Titans can wreak havoc with their massive warhammers, which
are sometimes referred to as “mauls of the titans.” In
addition to their considerable battle prowess, titans
possess great speed and considerable magical
power.
A titan’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Oversized Weapon (Ex): A titan
wields a great, two-handed warhammer (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without
penalty.
Spell-Like Abilities:
At will—chain lightning
(DC 23), charm monster
(DC 21), cure critical wounds (DC 21),
fire storm (DC 24), greater dispel
magic, hold monster (DC 22), invisibility, invisibility purge, levitate,
persistent image (DC 22),
polymorph (humanoid
forms only, duration 1
hour); 3/day—etherealness, word of chaos (DC
22), summon nature’s ally IX; 1/day—gate,
maze, meteor swarm (DC 26). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.
In addition, titans of good or neutral alignment can use the following additional spell-like abilities: At will—daylight, holy smite
(DC 21), remove curse (DC 21); 1/day—greater restoration. Caster
level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Titans of evil alignment can use the following additional spelllike abilities: At will—bestow curse (DC 21), deeper darkness, unholy
blight (DC 21); 1/day—Bigby’s crushing hand (DC 26). Caster level
20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND
Titans enjoy combat and usually close with their foes. If that
proves ineffective, they swiftly back off and pelt the foe with spelllike abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan’s Quicken
Spell-Like Ability feat, it can use chain lightning as a free action,
and frequently attacks in melee while lashing out with this ability
at the same time.
Prior to combat: Invisibility purge or invisibility.
Round 1: Charge and attempt to sunder the weapon of the most
dangerous foe. Hurl chain lightning at opponents standing away
from the fight.
Round 2: Full attack against the disarmed opponent, and hurl
chain lightning at other opponents.
Round 3: Back away from first opponent and use maze or meteor
swarm on any spellcaster causing trouble.
Round 4: Sunder the weapon of the next most effective combatant, or use greater dispel magic on all nearby opponents.
Round 5: Full attack against any nearby opponent, or use fire storm.
Use another quickened chain lightning if foes seem really dangerous.
A titan usually reserves its gate and etherealness abilities to escape
a fight that is not going well.
TOJANIDA
This creature resembles a snapping turtle. It has a spindle-shaped shell
made up of hexagonal plates and a narrow head with jaws that open horizontally rather than vertically. A seemingly random array of crablike claws
and paddles sprout from openings at both ends of the creature’s shell.
Tojanidas are omnivores from the Elemental Plane of Water.
Though they seem clumsy and innocuous at first glance, they are
nimble swimmers and capable fighters.
A tojanida’s shell is blue-green in color. Inside the shell is a
fleshy body from which extend seven stalks. Four of these stalks
Tojanida
have paddles for locomotion, two are tipped with claws, and one
bears the creature’s head. Eight vents in the shell, four at each end,
allow the tojanida to thrust its stalks out in whatever configuration it finds convenient.
A juvenile tojanida is up to 25 years old. It has a shell about 3
feet long, and it weighs about 60 pounds. An adult is aged 26 to 80.
Its shell is about 6 feet long, and it weighs about 220 pounds. An
elder can reach 150 years of age. It has a shell about 9 feet long, and
it weighs about 500 pounds.
Tojanidas speak Aquan and can be loquacious, but usually only
on the subject of food.
COMBAT
Tojanidas are fairly even-tempered but can be ferocious if molested. They are very jealous of their food supply and become testy
if they suspect a newcomer is trying to beat them to a meal.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tojanida must hit
with a bite or claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as
a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Underwater, a tojanida can tow a grabbed victim of its own size or
smaller at its swim speed (but it cannot run). A favorite tactic is to
grab a single opponent, then withdraw, hauling the opponent
away from its allies.
Ink Cloud (Ex): A tojanida can emit a spherical cloud of jetblack ink with a radius of 30 feet once per minute as a free action.
The effect is otherwise similar to fog cloud cast by an individual of
a level equal to the tojanida’s Hit Dice. Out of water, the ink
emerges in a stream up to 30 feet long, which a tojanida can squirt
into an opponent’s eyes. The affected creature must succeed on a
Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. The save DC is 13 against a
juvenile, 15 against an adult, and 21 against an elder. The save DCs
are Constitution based.
All-Around Vision (Ex): The multiple apertures in a tojanida’s
shell allow it to look in any direction, bestowing a +4 racial bonus
on Spot and Search checks. Opponents gain no flanking bonuses
when attacking a tojanida.
Skills: A tojanida has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.

This tall being looks much like an
animated tree. Its skin is thick and
brown, with a barklike texture.
Its arms are gnarled like branches,
and its legs look like the split trunk of
a tree. Above the eyes and along the
head are dozens of smaller branches
from which hang great leaves.
Treants combine features of trees
and humans. They are peaceful by
nature but deadly when angered. They hate evil and the unrestrained use of fire, considering themselves guardians of the
trees.
A treant’s leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In
the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red,
but they rarely fall out. A treant’s legs fit together when closed to
look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly
indistinguishable from a tree.
A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in
diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.
Treants speak their own language, plus Common
and Sylvan. Most also can manage a smattering of
just about all other humanoid tongues—at least
enough to say “Get away from my trees!”
COMBAT
Treants prefer to watch potential foes
carefully before attacking. They often
charge suddenly from cover to trample
the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed,
they animate trees as reinforcements.
Animate Trees (Sp): A treant can animate trees
within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It
takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it
moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated
them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the
same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.
Double Damage against Objects (Ex): A treant or animated
tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals
double damage.
Trample (Ex): Reflex DC 22 half. The save DC is Strengthbased.
Skills: *Treants have a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks made
in forested areas.

This being is roughly human-sized. Its lower half
ends in two finned legs, while its torso, head,
and arms are human.
Tritons are thought to originate from the
Elemental Plane of Water, but have migrated to
the Material Plane for some unknown purpose. They are sea dwellers, preferring warm
waters but able to tolerate colder depths.
A triton has silvery skin that fades into
silver-blue scales on the lower half of its body.
A triton’s hair is deep blue or blue-green.
Tritons form communities, either in great undersea
castles built of rock, coral, and other natural materials or
in finely sculpted caverns. A hunter-gatherer people, tritons take
from the sea’s vast bounty only what they need to survive. They are
naturally suspicious of surface dwellers and prefer not to deal with
them if possible. However, tritons deal harshly with beings who
intentionally invade their communities, capturing the intruders
and setting them adrift without any possessions at least 10 miles
from any shoreline, left “to the mercy of the sea.”
Tritons are the natural enemy of the cruel and evil sahuagin.
The two cannot coexist peacefully: Wars between them are prolonged, bloody affairs that sometimes interfere with shipping and
maritime trade.
A triton is about the same size and weight as a human.
Tritons speak Common and Aquan.
Treant
COMBAT
The reclusive tritons prefer to avoid combat, but they fiercely
defend their homes. They attack with either melee or ranged
weapons as the circumstances warrant. When encountered outside their lair, they are 90% likely to be mounted
on friendly sea creatures such as porpoises.
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—summon nature’s
ally IV. Caster level 7th. Tritons often choose
water elementals for their companions.
Skills: A triton has a +8 racial bonus
on any Swim check to perform some
special action or avoid a hazard. It can
always choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while
swimming, provided it swims in a

This reptilian creature looks somewhat humanoid. It is a little shorter than
a human. It has spindly but muscular arms and walks erect on its squat
legs, trailing a long, slender tail. Its head is lizardlike and crowned with a
frill that extends from the forehead to the base of the neck. Its eyes are
black and beady.
Troglodytes are revolting lizard creatures as evil as the
foulest of demons. They are very warlike and savor the
taste of their enemies—especially humanoids.
Troglodytes are not especially intelligent, but their
ferocity and natural cunning more than compensate
for this deficiency. They often launch bloody raids
against humanoid settlements or ambush caravans in
warm climates. They guard their lairs aggressively,
lashing out at anyone who comes too near.
A troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs
about 150 pounds.
Troglodytes speak Draconic.
COMBAT
Half of a group of troglodytes are armed only with
claws and teeth; the rest carry one or two javelins
and clubs. They normally conceal themselves, launch
a volley of javelins, then close to attack. If the battle
goes against them, they retreat and attempt to hide.
Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte is angry or frightened,
it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that nearly every
form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures
(except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a troglodyte must
succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10
rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures
that successfully save cannot be affected by the
same troglodyte’s stench for 24 hours. A delay
poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect
from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant
to poison receive their normal
bonus on their saving
throws.
Skills: The
skin of a troglodyte changes
color somewhat, allowing it to
blend in with its surroundings like a chameleon and
providing a +4 racial bonus
on Hide checks. *In rocky
or underground settings,
this bonus improves to +8.
TROGLODYTE
SOCIETY
Troglodyte tribes are ruled
by the largest and fiercest
among them, with subchieftains
who
have distinguished themselves in battle. Trogs like
to lair near humanoid settlements to prey on inhabitants and their livestock.
They raid on moonless
nights when their darkvision
and coloration are most effective.
TROGLODYTE
Triton
246 Troglodyte
Troglodytes prize steel above all else. Though individuals usually have no wealth, a lair may contain valuable items casually discarded, pushed into corners, or mixed in with refuse. The lair is
usually a large cave with smaller caves for the hatchlings and eggs.
A lair has hatchlings equal to one-fifth the number of adults and
eggs equal to one-tenth.
Troglodytes revere Laogzed, a vile deity who resembles a cross
between a toad and a lizard.

TROLL
This big, bipedal creature is about one and a half times as tall as a human
but very thin. It has long and ungainly arms and legs The legs end in great
three-toed feet, the arms in wide, powerful hands with sharpened claws.
The hide is rubbery, and its hair is thick and ropy, and seems to writhe with
its own energy.
Trolls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic wastelands to tropical jungles. Most creatures avoid these beasts, who
know no fear and attack unceasingly when hungry.
Trolls have ravenous appetites, devouring everything from
grubs to bears and humanoids. They often lair near settlements
and hunt the inhabitants until they devour every last one.
Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle
and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness,
trolls are very agile.
A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
Females are slightly larger than males. A troll’s rubbery hide is
moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray.
Trolls speak Giant.
COMBAT
Trolls have no fear of death: They launch themselves into combat
without hesitation, flailing wildly at the closest opponent. Even
when confronted with fire, they try to get around the flames and
attack.
Rend (Ex): If a troll hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto
the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically
deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.

3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member
instantly by holding it to the stump.
SCRAG
These cousins of the troll have the aquatic subtype. They dwell in
any body of water in any climate. They have a base land speed of 20
feet and a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic environments. They regenerate only if mostly immersed in water.
TROLL HUNTER
Some trolls, more cunning than most, are not satisfied with
merely eating civilized beings but train to hunt them relentlessly. These troll hunters are fearsome rangers who focus
on slaying and devouring humanoid prey.
Combat
A troll hunter makes full use of its scent ability to
track its favored enemies and generally prefers to
hunt in darkness.
The troll hunter uses its limited repertoire of spells
to protect itself from damaging forms of energy and
to immobilize enemies.
Typical anger Spells Prepared (2; save DC 12 + spell

UMBER HULK
This hulking, powerfully built creature looks something like
a cross between a great ape and a beetle. The low, rounded
head is dominated by a massive pair of mandibles and rows
of triangular teeth. It has two big compound eyes like a
beetle’s, with two smaller eyes like an ape’s in between.
Armor plates cover virtually all of its chitinous body, whose scattered feelers resemble sparse hair.
Umber hulks are massive creatures that dwell deep beneath the earth. Ripping through rock as though it were light
underbrush, they rampage continuously, leaving destruction in
their wake.
UMBER HULK
U mber hulk illus. by T. Lockwood
Troll
Umberhulk
248
An umber hulk stands roughly 8 feet tall and measures nearly 5
feet across, weighing about 800 pounds. An umber hulk can
burrow through solid rock at a speed of 5 feet. It does not leave a
usable tunnel unless it chooses to.
Umber hulks speak Terran.
COMBAT
An umber hulk can deliver blows powerful enough to crush
almost any enemy. In addition, its mandibles are strong enough to
bite through armor or exoskeletons with ease.
Despite its great bulk, an umber hulk is intelligent. When brute
force won’t overcome an enemy, it is more than capable of outthinking those who assume it to be a stupid beast. Umber hulks
often use their tunneling ability to create deadfalls and pits for
the unwary.
Confusing Gaze (Su): Confusion as the spell, 30 feet, caster
level 8th, Will DC 15 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.
TRULY HORRID UMBER HULK
Umber hulks have been known to grow to tremendous size
and strength. The truly horrid umber hulk stands more
than 16 feet in height and weighs about 8,000
pounds. Phenomenally powerful, the truly horrid umber hulk is a loner that is feared even by
its own kind. It is occasionally found in the
service of evil dragons or sorcerers, guarding
their lairs.
The Will save DC is 22 against the truly horrid
umber hulk’s confusing gaze, due to its higher Hit
Dice and Charisma score.
UNICORN
This powerful, equine creature has a gleaming white coat and big,
lively eyes. Long, silky white hair hangs down in a mane and forelock.
A single ivory-colored horn, about 2 feet long, grows from the center
of the forehead. The hooves are cloven.
These fierce, noble beasts shun contact with all but sylvan creatures (dryads, pixies, and the like), showing themselves only to
defend their woodland homes.
A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes.
Males sport a white beard.
Unicorns mate for life, making their homes in open dells or
glades in the forests they protect. Good and neutral travelers may
pass freely through and even hunt for food in a unicorn’s forest,
but evil creatures do so at great risk. Likewise, a unicorn will
attack any being it discovers killing for sport in its territory or
damaging the forest maliciously.
Lone unicorns occasionally allow themselves to be tamed and
ridden by good human or elven maidens of pure heart. Such a unicorn, if treated kindly, is the maiden’s loyal steed and protector for
life, even accompanying her beyond its forest.
A unicorn’s horn is renowned for its healing properties. Evil and
unscrupulous beings sometimes hunt a unicorn for its horn,
which can fetch up to 2,000 gp, for use in various healing potions
and devices. Most good creatures refuse to traffic in such things.
A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5
feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds.
Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males.
Unicorns speak Sylvan and Common.
COMBAT
Unicorns normally attack only when defending
themselves or their forests. They either charge,
impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike
with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon,
though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.
Magic Circle against Evil (Su): This ability continuously duplicates the effect of the spell. A unicorn cannot suppress this ability.
Spell-Like Abilities: Unicorns can
use detect evil at will as a free action.
Once per day a unicorn can use
greater teleport to move anywhere
within its home. It cannot teleport
beyond the forest boundaries nor
back from outside.
A unicorn can use cure light wounds
three times per day and cure moderate
wounds once per day (caster level 5th) by
touching a wounded creature with its horn. Once per

CELESTIAL CHARGER
A celestial unicorn is a champion for good, the fierce enemy of
evil beings that would destroy woodlands and their inhabitants. It
is a dedicated follower of Ehlonna.
The celestial charger described here is an 8 HD celestial
unicorn with seven levels of cleric.
Combat
The save DC for this celestial charger’s neutralize poison ability (DC
20) is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and altered Charisma score.
A celestial charger’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Smite Evil (Su): Once per day a celestial charger can make a
normal melee attack to deal 15 points of extra damage against an
evil foe.

VAMPIRE
Forever anchored to their coffins and the unholy earth of their
graves, these nocturnal predators scheme constantly to strengthen
themselves and fill the world with their foul progeny.
Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features
are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of wolves.
Like liches, they often embrace finery and decadence and may
assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance,
vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and
throw no reflections in mirrors.
Vampires speak any languages they knew in life.
SAMPLE VAMPIRE
This sinister-looking warrior has pale skin, haunting red eyes, and a feral
cast to his features. He wears chain armor and holds a spiked chain in his
clawed hands.

CREATING A VAMPIRE
“Vampire” is an acquired template that can be added to any
humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature (referred to hereafter
as the base creature).
A vampire uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented humanoid or monstrous humanoid). Do not recalculate
base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.
Hit Dice: Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.
Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a
swim speed, the vampire retains the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to immersion in running water (see below).
Armor Class: The base creature’s natural armor bonus improves by +6.
Attack: A vampire retains all the attacks of the base creature
and also gains a slam attack if it didn’t already have one. If the base
creature can use weapons, the vampire retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A vampire armed with a
weapon uses its slam or a weapon, as it desires.
Full Attack: A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its
slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed
with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack along
with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.
Damage: Vampires have slam attacks. If the base creature does
not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value from
the table below according to the vampire’s size. Creatures that
have other kinds of natural weapons retain their old damage
values or use the appropriate value from the table below,
whichever is better.
Size Damage
Fine 1
Diminutive 1d2
Tiny 1d3
Small 1d4
Medium 1d6
Large 1d8
Huge 2d6
Gargantuan 2d8
Colossal 4d6
Special Attacks: A vampire retains all the special attacks of
the base creature and gains those described below. Saves have a
DC of 10 + 1/2 vampire’s HD + vampire’s Cha modifier unless
noted otherwise.
Blood Drain (Ex): A vampire can suck blood from a living victim
with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the
foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each
round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the
vampire gains 5 temporary hit points.
Children of the Night (Su): Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat
swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard
action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might
summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive
in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
Dominate (Su): A vampire can crush an opponent’s will just by
looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except
that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely
looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must
succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire’s influence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The
ability has a range of 30 feet.
Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by
a vampire’s energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire
Spawn entry, page 253) 1d4 days after burial.
If the vampire instead drains the victim’s Constitution to 0 or
lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a
vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or
spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and
remains enslaved until its master’s destruction. At any given time
a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice
its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit
are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire
that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a
master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this
fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire
spawn cannot be enslaved again.
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a vampire’s slam attack
(or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two
negative levels. For each negative level bewtowed, the vampire
gains 5 temporary hit points. A vampire can use its energy drain
ability once per round.
Special Qualities: A vampire retains all the special qualities of
the base creature and gains those described below.
Alternate Form (Su): A vampire can assume the shape of a bat,
dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to a polymorph spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that
the vampire does not regain hit points for changing form and
must choose from among the forms mentioned here. While in its
alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary
special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it
assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is
not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms.)
Damage Reduction (Su): A vampire has damage reduction
10/silver and magic. A vampire’s natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Fast Healing (Ex): A vampire heals 5 points of damage each
round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points
in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to
escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly
destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no
effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1
hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.
Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, a vampire can assume
gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain
gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect
maneuverability.
Resistances (Ex): A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10.
Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though
with a spider climb spell.
Turn Resistance (Ex): A vampire has +4 turn resistance.
Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +6,
Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire
has no Constitution score.
Skills: Vampires have a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen,
Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise
same as the base creature.
Feats: Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge,
Improved Initiative, and Lightning Reflexes, assuming the base
creature meets the prerequisites and doesn’t already have these
feats.
Environment: Any, usually same as base creature.
Organization: Solitary, pair, gang (3–5), or troupe (1–2 plus
2–5 vampire spawn)
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.
Treasure: Double standard.
Alignment: Always evil (any).
Advancement: By character class.
Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +8.
Vampire Weaknesses
For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.
Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate
the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area
laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or
a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don’t
harm the vampire—they merely keep it at bay. A
recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away
from a creature holding the mirror
or holy symbol and cannot touch
or make melee attacks against the
creature holding the item for
the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.
Vampires are also unable to
cross running water, although
they can be carried over it
while resting in their
coffins or aboard a ship.
They are utterly unable to
enter a home or other
building unless invited in
by someone with the
authority to do so. They
may freely enter public
places, since these are by
definition open to all.
Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower
incapacitates it but doesn’t always
destroy it (see the note on fast healing). However, certain attacks can
slay vampires.
Exposing any vampire
to direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a
single move action or
attack action and is
destroyed utterly in the
next round if it cannot
escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of
one-third of its hit points each round until it is
destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion.
Driving a wooden stake through a vampire’s heart
instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake
is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic is to cut
off the creature’s head and fill its mouth with holy wafers (or their
equivalent).
Vampire Characters
Vampires are always evil, which causes characters of certain
classes to lose some class abilities, as noted in Chapter 3 of the
Player’s Handbook. In addition, certain classes take additional
penalties.
Clerics: Vampire clerics lose their ability to turn undead but
gain the ability to rebuke undead. This ability does not affect the
vampire’s controller or any other vampires that a master controls.
A vampire cleric has access to two of the following domains:
Chaos, Destruction, Evil, or Trickery.
Sorcerers and Wizards: Vampire sorcerers and wizards retain
their class abilities, but if a character has a familiar other than a rat
or bat, the link between them is broken, and the familiar shuns its
former companion. The character can summon another familiar,
but it must be a rat or bat.

This feral-looking creature virtually
drips with evil. Its garb is noble-looking, though in a state of disrepair. Its
dark red mouth is dominated by a
pair of vicious-looking canine teeth.
Vampire spawn are undead creatures that come into being when vampires slay
mortals. Like their creators, spawn remain bound
to their coffins and to the soil of their graves.
Vampire spawn appear much as they did in life, although their
features are often hardened, with a predatory look.
Vampire spawn speak Common.
VAMPIRE
SPAWN
Vampire spawn
253
COMBAT
Vampire spawn use their inhuman strength when engaging mortals, hammering their foes with powerful blows and dashing them
against rocks or walls. They also use their gaseous form and flight
abilities to strike where opponents are most vulnerable.
Blood Drain (Ex): A vampire spawn can suck blood from a
living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check.
If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round. On each such successful drain attack,
the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit pints.
Domination (Su): A vampire spawn can crush an opponent’s will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must take a
standard action, and those merely looking at it are not
affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a
DC 14 Will save or fall instantly under the vampire’s
influence as though by a dominate person spell from a 5thlevel caster. The ability has a range of 30 feet. The
save DC is Charisma-based.
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a vampire spawn’s slam attack gain one negative level. The
DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative
level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such negative level bestowed, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit
points.
Fast Healing (Ex): A vampire spawn heals 2 points of
damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If
reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes
gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its
coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It
can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its
coffin, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour,
then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate
of 2 hit points per round.
Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, a vampire
spawn can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level
6th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed
of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces
as though with a spider climb spell.
Skills: Vampire spawn have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide,
Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.
VAMPIRE SPAWN WEAKNESSES
Vampire spawn are vulnerable to all attacks and effects that repel
or slay vampires. For details, see the Vampire entry.

This creature looks like a hideous, distorted
human head suspended from leathery wings.
In place of hair, it is crowned with
writhing tendrils, and its eyes burn with
a menacing green flame.
These revolting creatures come
into the world from the deepest
pits of the plane of Carceri. They
haunt graveyards, ruins, and other
places of death and decay.
A vargouille is slightly larger than a
human head, about 18 inches high, with
a wingspan of 4 feet. It weighs about 10
pounds.
Vargouilles speak Infernal.
COMBAT
Vargouilles attack by
biting with their jagged teeth.
Their special attacks make
them even more dangerous.
A vargouille’s natural weapons,
as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Shriek (Su): Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth and let out a terrible shriek. Those within 60 feet
(except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see
the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with fear for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them,
goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A paralyzed creature is susceptible to the vargouille’s kiss (see below). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille’s
shriek for 24 hours. The shriek is a mind-affecting fear effect. The
save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
iss (Su): A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a successful melee touch attack. An affected opponent must succeed on
a DC 15 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that
turns the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often
much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim’s hair falls out.
Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery
wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth
become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the
victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1
point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the head breaks free of the body
(which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille.
VARGOUILLE

This transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and even a daylight spell can delay death, but to reverse the transformation requires remove disease. The save DC is Constitution-based and
includes a +4 racial bonus.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 12 or be unable to
heal the vargouille’s bite damage naturally or magically. A neutralize poison or heal spell removes the
effect, while delay poison allows magical healing. The save DC is Constitution-based and
includes a +1 racial bonus.

This creature resembles a human corpse. Its wild,
frantic eyes burn with malevolence. The leathery,
desiccated flesh is drawn tight across its bones,
and the teeth have grown into sharp, jagged
needles.
Wights are undead creatures given a semblance of life through sheer violence and
hatred. A wight’s appearance is a weird and
twisted reflection of the form it had in life.
Wights lurk in barrow-mounds, catacombs,
and other places thick with the aura of death,
where they nurture their hatred. They seek to
destroy all life, filling graveyards with their victims and populating the world with their horrid
progeny.
A wight is about the height and weight of a
human.
Wights speak Common.
COMBAT
Wights attack by hammering with their fists.
Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a wight
becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the
command of the wight that created them and remain
enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of
the abilities they had in life.
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit
by a wight’s slam attack gain one negative
level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to
remove a negative level. The save DC is

This creature seems to be nothing but a faintly
glowing sphere of light.
Will-o’-wisps are evil creatures that feed
on the powerful emotions associated with
panic, horror, and death. They delight in
luring travelers into deadly peril, then
absorbing the resulting emanations.
Will-o’-wisps can be yellow, white,
green, or blue. They are easily mistaken for
lanterns, especially in the foggy marshes
and swamps where they reside.
A will-o’-wisp’s body is a globe of spongy
material about 1 foot across and weighing

about 3 pounds, and its glowing body sheds as much light as a
torch.
Will-o’-wisps speak Common and Auran. They have no
vocal apparatus but can vibrate to create a voice with a ghostly
sound.
COMBAT
Will-o’-wisps usually avoid combat. They prefer to
confuse and bewilder adventurers, luring them into
morasses or other hazardous places. When they are
forced to fight, they loose small electrical shocks,
which act as melee touch attacks.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A will-o’-wisp is immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow
spell resistance, except magic missile and maze.
Natural Invisibility (Ex): A startled or frightened
will-o’-wisp can extinguish its glow, effectively becoming invisible as the spell.

This creature looks like a white wolf with icy blue eyes. It stands as tall as
a horse, and its breath smokes with cold.
Dangerous predators of the tundra and other chill regions, winter
wolves pursue prey relentlessly. They rarely give up the chase until
they bring down their quarry.
Winter wolves are more intelligent than their smaller cousins
and sometimes associate with other evil creatures of their cold
homelands, such as frost giants, whom they serve as scouts,
hunters, and trackers.
A winter wolf grows about 8 feet long and stands about 4-1/2
feet at the shoulder. It weighs about 450 pounds.
Winter wolves can speak Giant and Common.
COMBAT
Winter wolves typically hunt in packs. Their size, cunning, and
formidable breath weapon allow them to hunt and kill creatures
much larger than themselves. A pack usually circles an opponent,
each wolf attacking in turn to exhaust it. If they’re in a hurry,
white wolves try to pin their foes.
Breath Weapon (Su): 15-foot cone, once every
1d4 rounds, damage 4d6 cold, Reflex DC 16 half.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Freezing Bite (Su): A winter wolf
deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage
every time it bites an opponent, as if its
bite were a frost weapon.
Trip (Ex): A winter wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt
to trip the opponent (+8 check modifier) as a free action without
making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If
the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the winter
wolf.
Skills: Winter wolves have a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move
Silently, and Spot checks.
Winter wolves have a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks. *Their
natural coloration grants them a +7 racial bonus on Hide checks in
areas of snow and ice.
A winter wolf has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when
tracking by scent.

This beast looks like a dark-colored wolf with a malevolent intelligence in
its face and eyes.
Worgs are sinister wolves that have attained some intelligence and
an evil disposition. They sometimes associate with other evil
beings, particularly goblins, whom they serve as mounts and
guardians.
Worgs usually live and hunt in packs. Their favored prey is large
herbivores. Although they typically stalk and kill young, sick, or
weak animals, they don’t hesitate to hunt humanoids, particularly
when game is scarce. Worgs may stalk humanoid prey for hours or
even days before attacking, and choose the most advantageous terrain and time of day to do so (during the predawn hours, for
example).
A typical worg has gray or black fur, grows to 5 feet long and
stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs 300 pounds.
More intelligent than their smaller cousins, worgs speak their
own language. Some can also speak Common and Goblin.
COMBAT
Mated pairs or packs work together to bring down large game,
while lone worgs usually chase down creatures smaller than
themselves. Both often use hit-and-run tactics to exhaust their
quarry. A pack usually circles a larger opponent: Each wolf attacks
in turn, biting and retreating, until the creature is exhausted, at
which point the pack moves in for the kill. If they get impatient or
heavily outnumber the opponent, worgs attempt to pin it.
Trip (Ex): A worg that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip
the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making
a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the
attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the worg.
Skills: A worg has a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently,
and Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks.
*A worg has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking
by scent.
WRAITH
This creature is a sinister, spectral figure robed in darkness. It has no visible features or appendages, except for the glowing red pinpoints of its eyes.
Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. They
despise all living things, as well as the light that nurtures them.
In some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear
armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not
affect the creature’s AC or combat abilities but only reflects the
shape it had in life.
WRAITH
Worgs
257
A wraith is about as tall as a human, while a dread wraith is
roughly the size of an ogre. Since both are incorporeal, they are
weightless.
Wraiths speak Common and Infernal.
COMBAT
Both the wraith and the dread wraith share the following
abilities.
Unnatural Aura (Su): Animals, whether
wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a wraith at a distance of 30
feet. They will not willingly approach
nearer than that and panic if forced to do
so; they remain panicked as long as they are
within that range.
Daylight Powerlessness (Ex): Wraiths are
utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not
merely a daylight spell) and flee from it.
WRAITH
Close combat with a wraith is dangerous, thanks
to its deadly touch.
Constitution Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a wraith’s incorporeal touch
attack must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude
save or take 1d6 points of Constitution
drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On
each such successful attack, the wraith
gains 5 temporary hit points.
Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a
wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and inanimate, but
its spirit is torn free from its corpse and transformed. Spawn are
under the command of the wraith that created them and remain
enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities
they had in life.
DREAD WRAITH
The oldest and most malevolent wraiths
lurk in the depths of forgotten temples and other forsaken places. They
can sense the approach of living creatures, and hunger for them. Despite its
size, the dread wraith possesses unearthly quickness, and makes use of its
Spring Attack feat and natural reach to
strike with deadly effect and melt
back into the shadows—or the walls.
Lifesense (Su): A dread wraith
notices and locates living creatures
within 60 feet, just as if it possessed
the blindsight ability. It also senses the
strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.
Constitution Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a dread wraith’s incorporeal touch
attack must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save
or take 1d8 points of Constitution drain. The save
DC is Charisma-based. On each such successful attack,
the dread wraith gains 5 temporary hit points.
Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a dread wraith
becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and
inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and
transformed. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that
created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

This two-legged lizard is bigger than an ogre. It
has a long tail tipped with a thick knot of cartilage from which a stinger protrudes much like
that of a scorpion. It has leathery bat wings
and huge jaws filled with long, sharp teeth.
A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a
huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail.
A wyvern does not have a strong odor, although its
lair might smell of a recent kill.
A wyvern’s body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to
gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is
about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one
ton.
Wyverns speak Draconic, but usually
don’t bother with anything more elaborate than a loud hiss or a deepthroated growl much like that of a bull
alligator.
COMBAT
Wyverns are rather stupid but always aggressive: They attack
nearly anything that isn’t obviously more powerful than
themselves. A wyvern dives from the air,
snatching the opponent with its talons and
stinging it to death.
A wyvern can slash with its talons
only when making a flyby attack.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use
this ability, a wyvern must
hit with its talons. It can
then attempt to start a
grapple as a free
action without
provoking an
attack of opportunity. If
it wins the
grapple
check, it
establishes a
hold and stings.
Poison (Ex):
Injury, Fortitude
DC 17, initial
and secondary damage
2d6 Con.
The save DC is
Constitutionbased.
Skills: Wyverns have a
+3 racial bonus on Spot checks.

This quasi-reptilian creature has four arms, bright red scales, and dark,
penetrating eyes. It is not quite as tall as a human.
Malevolent in the extreme, xills are known for brutality and totalitarianism. They combine a healthy dose of evil with a keen love of
cruelty.
Some xills are barbaric and fierce; others are more civilized
creatures who rely on brutal order.
A xill stands 4 to 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds.
Xills speak Infernal.
COMBAT
Xills are dangerous opponents,
attacking with all four limbs.
More civilized ones use
weapons, usually fighting
with two at a time so as to leave
two claws free for grab attacks.
Xills typically lie in wait on
the Ethereal Plane for suitable
prey to happen by, then
ambush it using their
planewalk ability. They make full
use of their Tumble skill in
combat: Usually, one or two
distract physically powerful
enemies by attacking, then
assuming a defensive stance
while their fellows maneuver
to advantage.
Implant (Ex): As a standard action, a xill can lay eggs inside a paralyzed creature. The
young emerge about 90 days later, literally devouring the host
from inside. A remove disease spell rids a victim of the egg, as does a
DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but
each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the
patient.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a xill must hit with one
or more claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. It receives a +2
bonus on the grapple check for each claw that hits. If it wins the
grapple check and maintains the hold in the next round, it automatically bites the foe at that time. The bite deals no damage but
injects a paralyzing venom.
Paralysis (Ex): Those bitten by a xill must succeed on a DC 14
Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Planewalk (Su): These planar travelers like to slip between the
folds of space to attack enemies as though from thin air. They can
cross from the Ethereal Plane with a move action but take 2 rounds
to cross back, during which time they are immobile. As a xill fades
away, it becomes harder to hit: Opponents have a 20% miss chance in
the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can
planewalk with a willing or helpless creature.
XILL CHARACTERS
A gang of xills is often led by a cleric. A xill cleric has access to two of
the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, or Travel.
XORN
This bizarre creature has a wide body made of a pebbly, stonelike material. It has a large, powerful mouth on top of its head, with three long
arms, tipped with sharp talons, symmetrically positioned around it.
Between the arms are large, stone-lidded eyes that see in all directions. At
its base are three thick, short legs, each directly beneath an eye.
Xorns are scavengers from the Elemental Plane of Earth.
Minor xorns are about 3 feet tall and wide and weigh about 120
pounds. Average xorns are about 5 feet tall and wide, weighing
about 600 pounds. Elder xorns are about 8 feet tall and wide and
weigh about 9,000 pounds.
Xorns speak Common and Terran.
COMBAT
Xorns do not attack fleshly beings except to defend themselves
or their property, since they cannot digest meat. Xorns are indifferent to creatures of the Material Plane—with the
sole exception of anyone carrying a significant
amount of precious metals or minerals,
which xorns eat. They can smell food up to 20
feet away. A xorn can be quite aggressive when seeking food, especially on
the Material Plane, where such sustenance is harder to find than it is on its
native plane.
A xorn’s favorite mode of
attack is to wait just beneath a
stone surface until a foe
comes within reach, then
emerge suddenly. Groups of xorns
often send one of their number to the surface to negotiate for food while the remainder position themselves for a surprise attack.
All-Around Vision (Ex): A xorn’s symmetrically placed eyes allow it to look in any
direction, providing a +4 racial bonus on
Spot and Search checks. A xorn can’t be flanked.
Earth Glide (Ex): A xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or
almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims
through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor
does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth
spell cast on an area containing a burrowing xorn flings the xorn
back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds
on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

This creature looks something like an oversized greyhound
with dull black fur. Its eyes glow cherry red.
These fearsome flying hounds glide low over the
countryside at night, seeking likely prey.
A yeth hound stands 5 feet tall at the
shoulder and weighs about 400
pounds.
Yeth hounds cannot
speak, but understand
Infernal.
COMBAT
Yeth hounds hunt
only at night. They fear the sun and
never venture out in daylight, even if
their lives depend on it.
A yeth hound’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

Yeth
hound
Bay (Su): When a yeth hound howls or barks, all creatures
except other evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed
on a DC 11 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a
sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same hound’s bay for
24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Trip (Ex): A yeth hound that hits with its bite attack can
attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a
free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the
opponent cannot react to trip the yeth hound.
Flight (Su): A yeth hound can cease or
resume flight as a free action.

This creature resembles an eyeless, yellow-green flying reptile with fleshy
wings, a long tail, and a large fin on its back. It has single hornlike protrusion on its crocodilian head.
A strange predator from desolate wastelands, the yrthak terrorizes
the area it inhabits as an always hungry dragon might.
A yrthak is blind. It senses sound and movement by means of a
special organ on its long tongue. It emits powerfully focused
beams of sound from the protrusion on its head. The creature is a
yellowish-green color, with the wings and fin being more yellow
and the head and body more green. The teeth are yellow.
Yrthaks are crafty and devious. They are omnivorous but prefer
meat. An yrthak keeps a nest high in its isolated mountain lair and
may travel for days in search of food, returning only infrequently.
Yrthaks are sometimes seen swooping 100 feet or more above the
ground, attempting to sense prey.
A yrthak is about 20 feet long, with a wingspan of 40
feet. It weighs about 5,000 pounds.
Despite their intelligence, yrthaks do not speak.
COMBAT
A yrthak prefers to attack from the air, strafing
the ground with sonic attacks or snatching up
and dropping prey (eventually landing to
devour the flattened mess).
Sonic Lance (Su): Once every
2 rounds, a yrthak can
focus sonic energy
in a ray up to 60
feet long. This is a
ranged touch attack that deals
6d6 points of
damage to a single
target.
Explosion (Su): A
yrthak can fire its
sonic lance at
the ground, a large
rock, a stone wall, or
the like to create an
explosion of shattered
stone. This attack deals 2d6 points of piercing
damage to all within 10 feet of the effect’s center.
This counts as a use of the sonic lance attack and thus is usable
only once every 2 rounds, and never on the round following a
sonic lance attack.
Blindsight (Ex): A yrthak can ascertain all foes within 120 feet.
Beyond that range it is considered blinded. Yrthaks are invulnerable to gaze attacks, visual effects of spells such as illusions, and
other attack forms that rely on sight.
A yrthak whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively
blinded, treating all targets as having total concealment.
Immunities: Yrthaks have immunity to gaze attacks, visual
effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.
Skills: Yrthaks have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.
YUAN-TI
The yuan-ti are descended from humans whose bloodlines have
been mingled with those of snakes. Their evilness, cunning, and
ruthlessness are legendary.
Yuan-ti constantly scheme to advance their own dark agendas.
They are calculating and suave enough to form alliances with
other evil creatures when necessary, but they always put their own
interests first.
All yuan-ti possess some snakelike features, and many have
snake body parts.
Yuan-ti speak their own language, plus Common, Draconic, and
Abyssal.
COMBAT
Yuan-ti are geniuses and fight as such. They plan elaborate traps
and utilize their surroundings superbly in combat, preferring
Y R T H A K
Yrthak
262
YUAN-TI
263
ambushes to direct confrontation. They also prefer ranged attacks
and spells to melee.
In a mixed group, the least valuable and powerful attack first.
This means that the purebloods go before the halfbloods, which
go before the abominations. The group leader may order particular
members forward before others if that makes for better strategy.
Alternate Form (Sp): All yuan-ti can assume the form of a Tiny to
Large viper (see the Snake entry, page 280) as a psionic ability. This
ability is similar to a polymorph spell (caster level 19th), but a yuanti does not regain any hit points for changing form, and it can only
assume viper forms. The yuan-ti loses its natural weapons (if any)
and gains the natural weapon of the viper form it assumes. If the
yuan-ti has a poisonous bite of its own, it uses its own or the viper’s
poison, whichever is more potent.
Detect Poison (Sp): All yuan-ti have the psionic ability to detect
poison as the spell (caster level 6th).
YUAN-TI CHARACTERS
The favored class for yuan-ti purebloods and
halfbloods is ranger. Yuan-ti abominations
favor the cleric class. Yuan-ti clerics worship Merrshaulk. A yuan-ti cleric has
access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, Destruction, or
Plant.
YUAN-TI SOCIETY
The yuan-ti are devout worshipers of evil. They also hold
all reptiles in high esteem. The
center of yuan-ti life is the
temple, and their rituals often
involve bloody sacrifices.
They tend toward isolated,
old ruins but have been
known to build even underneath human cities. Yuan-ti
are always secretive about the
location of a city or temple.
Their architecture favors
curves, with ramps and poles
replacing stairs.
The abominations rule over
the yuan-ti and are the temple
leaders, with the high priest above
all. Purebloods take care of all outside negotiations, always pretending to be human.
The chief deity of the yuan-ti
is Merrshaulk, who prompted
and directed the formation of
the line.

This being has the body of a lithe human with sharp features and unblinking eyes. Its skin is covered with gleaming scales, and a serpent’s head,
complete with long fangs and forked tongue, rises from its shoulders.
Like purebloods, yuan-ti halfbloods appear mostly human, but
they always have obvious snake features. The snakelike features of
a halfblood may reflect any of a variety of venomous snakes, so a
halfblood may have a cobra’s hood or a diamondback’s distinctive
scale pattern. These features are usually consistent within a single
troupe of yuan-ti, and often mark a troupe’s status within a tribe.
A halfblood is about the same height and weight as a human.
Combat
Halfbloods typically hang back out of melee while any purebloods
accompanying them wade in, using their chameleon power to hide
while softening up opponents with their spell-like abilities. If the
purebloods all fall, the halfbloods wade into melee in their stead.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary
damage 1d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Produce Acid (Sp): A yuan-ti halfblood has the psionic power to
exude acid from its body, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage to the
next creature it touches, including a creature hit by its bite attack.
If the yuan-ti is grappling or pinning a foe when it uses this power,
its grasp deals 5d6 points of acid damage. The acid becomes inert
when it leaves the yuan-ti’s body, and the yuan-ti is immune to its
effects.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day—animal trance (DC 15), cause fear
(DC 14), entangle (DC 14); 1/day—deeper darkness, neutralize poison
(DC 17), suggestion (DC 16). Caster level 8th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.
Chameleon Power (Sp): A yuan-ti halfblood can psionically
change the coloration of itself and its equipment to match its surroundings, granting it a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.
Skills: *Yuan-ti halfbloods using chameleon power gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.
Halfblood Variants
The statistics above reflect the most common form of a yuan-ti
halfblood, with the head and scaly skin of a serpent but otherwise
human features. The curse of the yuan-ti produces a wide variety
of halfbloods, however, manifesting their serpentine nature in different ways. To generate a random yuan-ti halfblood, roll d% and
consult the following table.
d% Halfblood Variety
01–40 As described above
41–60 Human head, but arms are snakes (two bite attacks
instead of one, damage 1d4+2 plus poison)
61–80 Snake tail in addition to human legs (speed 30 ft., swim
15 ft., can constrict Small or smaller creatures for 1d4+3
points of damage)
81–00 Snake tail instead of human legs (speed 20 ft., climb 15
ft., swim 15 ft., can constrict Medium or smaller creatures
for 1d6+3 points of damage)
Constrict (Ex): A halfblood with a snake tail deals extra
damage (1d4+3 if it also has legs, or 1d6+3 if it does not) with a successful grapple check against a creature small enough for it to constrict.

This creature looks like a big serpent, except that its eyes betray a baleful
intelligence and it has two burly, humanoid arms.
Yuan-ti abominations are monstrous snakes with humanlike arms.
The snakelike features of an abomination may reflect any of a variety of venomous snakes, so an abomination may have a black
mamba’s glossy scales or a viper’s wedge-shaped head. These features are usually consistent within a single troupe of yuan-ti, and
often mark a troupe’s status within a tribe.
A yuan-ti abomination is 8 to 12 feet long and weighs 200 to 300
pounds.
Combat
Abominations are the masterminds of yuan-ti society, and urge
their lesser kin into battle from the rear. While their
underlings fight, the abominations watch the proceedings carefully, identifying the most dangerous foes and their most worrisome abilities, then
try to neutralize those enemies with their extensive spell-like and psionic abilities.
Aversion (Sp): A yuan-ti abomination can
psionically create a compulsion effect targeting
one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or gain an aversion to
snakes for 10 minutes. Affected creatures must
stay at least 20 feet away from any snake or yuanti, alive or dead; if already within 20 feet, they
move away. A subject unable to move away, or
one attacked by snakes or yuan-ti, is overcome
with revulsion. This revulsion reduces the
creature’s Dexterity score by 4
points until the effect wears off
or the subject is no longer
within 20 feet of a snake or
yuan-ti. This ability is otherwise similar to antipathy as the
spell (caster level 16th). The
save DC is Charisma-based.
Constrict (Ex): An abomination deals 1d6+6 points of
damage with a successful
grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To
use this ability, an abomination must hit a Large or
smaller creature with its
bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
free action without provoking
an attack of opportunity. If it
wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can
constrict.
Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 1d6
Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Produce Acid (Sp): An abomination has the psionic ability to
exude acid from its body, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage to the
next creature it touches, including a creature hit by its bite attack.
If the yuan-ti is grappling, constricting, or pinning a foe when it
uses this power, its grasp deals 5d6 points of acid damage. The acid
becomes inert when it leaves the yuan-ti’s body, and the yuan-ti is
immune to its effects.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will—animal trance (DC 16), entangle
(DC 15); 3/day—deeper darkness, neutralize poison (DC 18), suggestion
(DC 17); 1/day—baleful polymorph (DC 19; into snake form only),
fear (DC 18). Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Chameleon Power (Sp): A yuan-ti abomination can psionically
change the coloration of itself and its equipment to match its surroundings, granting it a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.
Skills: A yuan-ti abomination can always choose to take 10 on a
Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.
A yuan-ti abomination has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it
swims in a straight line.
*Yuan-ti abominations using chameleon power gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.
ZOMBIE
Zombies are corpses reanimated through dark and sinister magic.
These mindless automatons shamble about, doing their creator’s
bidding without fear or hesitation.
Zombies are not pleasant to look upon.
Drawn from their graves, half decayed and
partially consumed by worms, they wear
the tattered remains of their burial
clothes. A rank odor of death hangs heavy
in the air around them.
Because of their utter lack of intelligence,
the instructions given to a newly created
zombie must be very simple, such as “Kill
anyone who enters this room.”
CREATING A ZOMBIE
“Zombie” is an acquired template
that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an
undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to
hereafter as the base creature).
Size and Type: The creature’s type changes
to undead. It retains any subtypes except
alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as goblinoid
or reptilian). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities
except as noted here.
Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice from
class levels (to a minimum of 1),
double the number of Hit Dice left,
and raise them to d12s. If the base
creature has more than 10 Hit
Dice (not counting those gained
with experience), it can’t be
made into a zombie with the
animate dead spell.
Speed: If the base creature
can fly, its maneuverability rating
Zombie drops to clumsy.

Armor Class: Natural armor bonus increases by a number
based on the zombie’s size:
Tiny or smaller +0
Small +1

Large +3
Huge +4
Gargantuan +7

Base Attack: A zombie has a base attack bonus equal to 1/2 its
Hit Dice.
Attacks: A zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A zombie also gains a slam attack.
Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A slam attack deals damage depending on the zombie’s size.
(Use the base creature’s slam damage if it’s better.)
Fine 1
Diminutive 1d2
Tiny 1d3
Small 1d4
Medium 1d6
Large 1d8
Huge 2d6
Gargantuan 2d8
Colossal 4d6
Special Attacks: A zombie retains none of the base creature’s
special attacks.
Special Qualities: A zombie loses most special qualities of the
base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that
improve its melee or ranged attacks. A zombie gains the following
special quality.
Single Actions Only (Ex): Zombies have poor reflexes and can perform only a single move action or attack action each round. A
zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round, but
only if it attempts a charge.
Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and
Will +1/2 HD + 2.
Abilities: A zombie’s Strength increases by +2, its Dexterity
decreases by 2, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its
Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma changes to 1.
Skills: A zombie has no skills.
Feats: A zombie loses all feats of the base creature and gains
Toughness.

ANIMALS

CHAPTER 2: ANIMALS
This chapter provides statistics and basic information for many
common kinds of mundane animals. These creatures generally
operate on instinct, driven by simple needs such as food and
reproduction. Most animals, even predators, do not attack unless
they or their young are threatened.
Animals are not capable of detailed reasoning, although with
the Handle Animal skill it is possible to tame an animal and teach
it to perform certain tricks.
Some herbivorous animals do not normally use their natural
weapons to attack. As such, their natural weapons are treated as
secondary attacks. The animal’s attack and damage entries note
this fact, with an explanatory footnote.
Animal Traits: An animal possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence
score of 3 or higher can be an animal).
—Low-light vision.
—Alignment: Always neutral. Animals are not governed by a
human sense of morality.
—Treasure: None. Animals never possess treasure.

reaching 10 feet or more in length. Their tentacles are studded
with barbs and sharp-edged suckers.
Combat
An opponent can attack a giant octopus’s tentacles with a sunder
attempt as if they were weapons. A giant octopus’s tentacles have
10 hit points each. If a giant octopus is currently grappling a target
with the tentacle that is being attacked, it usually uses another
limb to make its attack of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder attempt. Severing one of a giant octopus’s tentacles
deals 5 points of damage to the creature. A giant octopus usually
withdraws from combat if it loses four tentacles. The creature
regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.

Combat
Blindsight (Ex): Porpoises can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them
to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence spell
negates this and forces the porpoise to rely on its vision, which is
approximately as good as a human’s.
Hold Breath (Ex): A porpoise can hold its breath for a number of
rounds equal to 6 × its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Skills: A porpoise has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

ANIMALS

Giant constrictor snakes are more aggressive than their smaller
cousins, principally because they need a great amount of food to
survive.
Viper Snake
These creatures range widely in size. They are not particularly
aggressive, but will often lash out with a bite attack before
attempting to retreat.
Combat
Viper snakes rely on their venomous bite to kill prey and defend
themselves.
Poison (Ex): A viper snake has a poisonous bite that deals initial and secondary damage of 1d6 Con. The save DC varies by the
snake’s size, as shown on the table below. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

These free-swimming mollusks are fairly aggressive. They are
more feared than sharks in some locales.
Combat
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a squid must hit an
opponent of any size with its arms attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
automatically deals bite damage.
*A squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.
Ink Cloud (Ex): A squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet
high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action.
The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally
uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.
Jet (Ex): A squid can jet backward once per round as a fullround action, at a speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight line,
but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
Skills: A squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can
use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a
straight line

These voracious creatures can have bodies more than 20 feet long
and attack almost anything they meet.
Combat
An opponent can attack a giant squid’s tentacles with a sunder
attempt as if they were weapons. A giant squid’s tentacles have 10
hit points each. If a giant squid is currently grappling a target with
the tentacle that is being attacked, it usually uses another limb to
make its attack of opportunity against the opponent making the
sunder attempt. Severing one of a giant squid’s tentacles deals 5
points of damage to the creature. A giant squid usually withdraws
from combat if it loses five tentacles. The creature regrows severed
limbs in 1d10+10 days.
Constrict (Ex): A giant squid deals 1d6+8 points of damage
with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a giant squid must hit
an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt
to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

Jet (Ex): A giant squid can jet backward once per round as a fullround action, at a speed of 320 feet. It must move in a straight line,
but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
Skills: A giant squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

These little mammals are aggressive predators but usually confine
themselves to smaller prey. The statistics presented here can also
apply to ferrets.
Combat
Attach (Ex): If a weasel hits with a bite attack, it uses its powerful jaws to latch onto the opponent’s body and automatically deals
bite damage each round it remains attached. An attached weasel
loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and has an AC of 12.
An attached weasel can be struck with a weapon or grappled
itself. To remove an attached weasel through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the creature.
Skills: Weasels have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks
and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. They use their
Dexterity modifier for Climb checks. A weasel can always choose
to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.
WHALE
Some varieties of these seagoing mammals are among the largest
animals known. Relatively small whales (such as the orca presented here) can be vicious predators, attacking virtually anything
they detect.
Blindsight (Ex): Whales can “see” by emitting high-frequency
sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to
locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence spell negates
this and forces the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human’s.
Hold Breath (Ex): A whale can hold its breath for a number of
rounds equal to 8 × its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Skills: A whale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
*A whale has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These
bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.

CHAPTER 3:
VERMIN

CHAPTER 3: VERMIN
This chapter provides statistics and basic information for several
kinds of monstrous vermin. These creatures operate on instinct,
driven by simple needs such as food and reproduction.
Except where noted, vermin attack only when hungry or
threatened.
Vermin Traits: Vermin possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mindaffecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Alignment: Always neutral. Vermin are not governed by a
human sense of morality.
—Treasure: Vermin generally possess no treasure. For those that
do, this treasure consists of possessions formerly owned by a creature that the monster has killed.
GIANT ANT
Giant ants are among the hardiest and most adaptable vermin. Soldiers and workers are about 6 feet long, while queens can grow to
a length of 9 feet.
Acid Sting (Ex): A giant soldier ant has a stinger and an acidproducing gland in its abdomen. If it successfully grabs an opponent, it can attempt to sting each round (+3 attack bonus). A hit
with the sting attack deals 1d4+1 points of piercing damage and
1d4 points of acid damage.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a giant ant must hit
with its bite attack. A giant soldier ant that wins the ensuing grapple check establishes a hold and can sting.
Skills: *Giant ants have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks
when tracking by scent and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. A
giant ant can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if
rushed or threatened.

MONSTROUS SPIDER
All monstrous spiders are aggressive predators that use their poisonous bites to subdue or kill prey.
Monstrous spiders come in two general types: hunters and
web-spinners. Hunters rove about, while web-spinners usually
attempt to trap prey. Hunting spiders can spin webs to use as lairs,
but cannot use their webs as weapons the way web-spinners can. A
hunting spider has a base land speed 10 feet faster than the figures
given in the statistics blocks.

enough to support the spider and one creature of the same size.
Web-spinners can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet,
with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets
up to one size category larger than the spider.
An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist
check or burst it with a Strength check. Both are standard actions
whose DCs are given in the table below. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.
Web-spinners often create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to
60 feet square, depending on the size of the spider. They usually
position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to
trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on
a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it
and become trapped as though by a successful web attack.
Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the
trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling
free. Each 5-foot section has the hit points given on the table, and
sheet webs have damage reduction 5/—.
A monstrous spider can move across its own web at its climb
speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.

Tremorsense (Ex): A monstrous spider can detect and pinpoint any creature or object within 60 feet in contact with the
ground, or within any range in contact with the spider’s webs.
Skills: Monstrous spiders have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and
Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. A monstrous
spider can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if
rushed or threatened. Monstrous spiders use either their
Strength or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is
higher.
*Hunting spiders have a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks and
a +8 racial bonus on Spot checks. Web-spinning spiders have a
+8 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks when using
their webs.

CHAPTER 4:
IMPROVING MONSTERS
Each of the monster entries in Chapters 1 through 3 describes a typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by
which extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding character classes, increasing
a monster’s Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These
methods are not mutually exclusive—it’s possible for a monster with
a template (a half-dragon lammasu, for example) to be improved by
both increasing its Hit Dice and adding character class levels.
Class Levels: Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance by adding class levels. Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of “By character
class” in their Advancement line. When a monster adds a class
level, that level usually represents an increase in experience and
learned skills and capabilities.
Increased Hit Dice: Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent monsters, can advance by increasing their Hit Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are usually
superior specimens of their race, bigger and more powerful than
their run-of-the-mill fellows.
Templates: Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an
unusual heritage (such as draconic or fiendish blood) or an inflicted
change in their essential nature (undeath or lycanthropy) may be
modified with a template. Templates usually result in tougher monsters with capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.
Each of these three methods for improving monsters is discussed in more detail below.
ABILITY SCORE ARRAYS
Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard)
ability scores—a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as modified by their
racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and
often have better than normal ability scores, and usually make use
of either the elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores.
Monsters who improve by adding a template, and monsters
who improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the
three arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique
enough to be improved could easily be considered elite.
Elite Array: The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. These numbers result in modifying the standard scores by +4, +4, +2, +2, +0,
and –2. While the monster has one weakness compared to a typical member of its race, it is significantly better overall. The elite
array is most appropriate for monsters who add levels in a player
character class. A player who wants to play a monster out of this
book as a player character but doesn’t want to roll its ability scores
should use the elite array.
Nonelite Array: The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. These
numbers result in modifying the standard scores by +2, +2, +0, +0,
–2, and –2. The nonelite array does not necessarily make a monster
better than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with strengths and weaknesses compared to a typical
member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who add class levels in a NPC class such as warrior or adept.
Ability Score Improvement: Whenever a monster reaches a
number of Hit Dice divisible by 4, it improves one ability score by
1 point. For example, a lammasu of 7 Hit Dice increased to 14 Hit
Dice gains an ability score improvement at 8 HD and another one
at 12 HD. Monsters do not gain ability score increases for levels
they “already reached” with their racial Hit Dice, since these
adjustments are included in their basic ability scores.
MONSTERS AND CLASS LEVELS
If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for multiclass characters described on pages 59–60 of the Player’s Handbook.
The creature’s Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus
its racial Hit Dice. For example, an ogre normally has 4 HD. If it
picks up one level of barbarian, it becomes a creature of 5 Hit Dice:
4d8 HD for its ogre levels, plus 1d12 HD for its barbarian level. A
creature’s “monster class” is always a favored class, and the creature
never takes XP penalties for having it. Additional Hit Dice gained
from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature’s size.
Humanoids and Class Levels: Creatures with 1 or less HD
replace their monster levels with their character levels. For
example, a goblin sorcerer loses its humanoid attack bonus, saving
throw bonuses, skills, and feats, and gains the attack bonus, save
bonuses, skills, feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level sorcerer.
Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level: To determine the effective character level (ECL) of a monster character, add
its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels.
The monster is considered to have experience points equal to the
minimum needed to be a character of its ECL. For example, a 4thlevel minotaur barbarian has an ECL of 12 (6 for its minotaur HD, 4
for its class levels, and 2 for its level adjustment). As the equivalent
of a 12th-level character, it has 66,000 XP, and must reach a total of
78,000 XP to become 13th level and add another class level.

Undead d12 HD ×1/2 (as wizard) Will 4 + Int mod per HD**
Vermin d8 HD ×3/4 (as cleric) Fort 2 + Int mod per HD**
All types have a number of feats equal to 1 + 1 per 3 Hit Dice.
* As long as a creature has an Intelligence of at least 1, it gains a minimum of 1 skill point per Hit Die.
** Creatures with an Intelligence score of “—” gain no skill points or feats.
CHAPTER 4:
MONSTERS
ADVANCING
291
If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its
character level for purposes of determining how much equipment
it can purchase. Generally, only monsters with an Advancement
entry of “By character class” receive NPC gear; other creatures adding character levels should be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR and assigned treasure, not equipment.
Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases: A monster’s
total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of feats and ability score increases. For example, a 1st-level minotaur barbarian has
a total of 7 HD. It has three feats (for its 1st, 3rd, and 6th HD).
When it gains 2nd level as a barbarian, it becomes a creature of 8
Hit Dice and improves one ability score by 1 point. When it adds
its 3rd level of barbarian, the minotaur becomes a creature of 9 Hit
Dice and gains its fourth feat.
INCREASING HIT DICE
As its Hit Dice increase, a creature’s attack bonuses and saving
throw modifiers might improve. It gains more feats and skills,
depending on its type, as shown on Table 4–1.
Saving throw bonuses are given on Table 3–1: Base Save and
Base Attack Bonuses, page 22 of the Player’s Handbook. A “good”
saving throw uses the higher of the listed values.
Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves according to its class, not its type.
See the sidebar on page 292 for an example of how to adjust the
statistics for a creature whose Hit Dice have been increased.
SIZE INCREASES
A creature may become larger when its Hit Dice are increased (the
new size is noted parenthetically in the monster’s Advancement
entry).
A size increase affects any special ability the creature has that is
affected by size, such as improved grab. Increased size also affects
a creature’s ability scores, AC, attack bonuses, and damage values
as indicated on Tables 4–2 and 4–3.
TEMPLATES
Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing
creature. A templated creature can represent a freak of nature, the
individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from parents of different species.
ACQUIRED AND INHERITED TEMPLATES
Some templates can be added to creatures anytime. A monster or
character may become a ghost after death. A spellcaster of at least
11th level can become a lich. Those with 5 or more HD killed by
vampires may become vampires. Templates such as these are
referred to as acquired templates, indicating that the creature did
not always have the attributes of the template.
Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a
creature from the beginning of its existence. Examples include
the celestial, fiendish, half-celestial, half-dragon, and half-fiend
templates—all assume the creature was born with the template.
It’s possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.
The lycanthrope template, for instance, is inherited for a creature
that was born with the affliction. It can also be acquired by a creature that is bitten by a natural lycanthrope.
READING A TEMPLATE
A template’s description provides a set of instructions for altering
an existing creature, known as the base creature.
The changes that a template might cause to each line of a creature’s
statistics block are discussed below. Generally, if a template does not
cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the
template description. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute
that is not changed is sometimes given as “Same as the base creature.”
Size and Type: Templates often change a creature’s type, and
may change the creature’s size.
If a template changes the base creature’s type, the creature also
acquires the augmented subtype (see page 306) unless the template description indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is
always paired with the creature’s original type. For example, a unicorn with the half-celestial template is an outsider with the augmented magical beast subtype. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the
features of the original type. The example half-celestial unicorn
has outsider traits (darkvision out to 60 feet, no soul) and magical
beast features (10-sided Hit Dice, base attack bonus equal to total
Hit Dice, good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and so on).
If a template changes a creature’s size, use Table 4–2 to calculate
changes to natural armor, Armor Class, attack rolls, and grapple bonus.
Hit Dice and Hit Points: Most templates do not change the
number of Hit Dice a monster has, but some do.
Some templates change the size of a creature’s Hit Dice (usually
by changing the creature type). A few templates change previously acquired Hit Dice, and continue to change Hit Dice gained
with class levels, but most templates that change Hit Dice change
only the creature’s original HD and leave class Hit Dice
unchanged.
If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing, Hit
Dice and hit points do not change unless the creature’s Constitution modifier changes.
Initiative: If a template changes the monster’s Dexterity, or if it
adds or removes the Improved Initiative feat, this entry changes.
Speed: If a template modifies a creature’s speed, the template
states how that happens. More commonly, a template adds a new
movement mode, such as a fly speed.
Armor Class: If a template changes the creature’s size, see Table
4–2 to determine its new Armor Class and to see whether its natural armor changes. In some cases, such as with the ghost template,
the method of determining Armor Class changes radically; the
template description explains how to adjust the creature’s AC.
Table 4–2: Changes to Statistics by Size
Natural AC/
Old Size* New Size Str Dex Con Armor Attack
Fine Diminutive Same –2 Same Same –4
Diminutive Tiny +2 –2 Same Same –2
Tiny Small +4 –2 Same Same –1
Small Medium +4 –2 +2 Same –1
Medium Large +8 –2 +4 +2 –1
Large Huge +8 –2 +4 +3 –1
Huge Gargantuan +8 Same +4 +4 –2
Gargantuan Colossal +8 Same +4 +5 –4
*-Repeat the adjustment if the creature moves up more than one size.
For example, if a creature advances from Medium to Huge size, it
gains +16 to Strength, –4 to Dexterity, and –2 to attack bonus and
Armor Class.
Table 4–3: Increased Damage By Size
Old Damage (Each)* New Damage
1d2 1d3
1d3 1d4
1d4 1d6
1d6 1d8
1d8 2d6
1d10 2d8
2d6 3d6
2d8 3d8
* Repeat the adjustment if the creature moves up more than one size
category. For example, if a Medium creature with two claw attacks
dealing 1d4 points of damage each advances from Medium to
Huge, the damage dealt by each of its claw attacks increases to 1d8.
CHAPTER 4:
ADVANCING
MONSTERS
292
Base Attack/Grapple: Templates usually do not change a creature’s base attack bonus. If a template modifies a creature’s base
attack bonus, the template description states how that happens.
Changes to a creature’s Strength score can change a creature’s grapple bonus, as can changes to its size; see Table 7–1, page 314.
Attack and Full Attack: Most templates do not change a creature’s attack bonus or modes of attack, even when the creature’s
type changes (the creature’s base attack bonus is the same as a creature of the original type). Of course, any change in ability scores
may affect attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use
the new modifier to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster’s size also changes its attack bonus; see Table 4–2.
Damage: Damage changes with Strength. If the creature uses a
two-handed weapon or has a single natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2
times its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has more than a single
attack, such as a character with two weapons or a monster with claws
and a bite, then it adds its Strength bonus to damage rolls for the primary attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary attacks.
Space/Reach: A template may change this entry if it changes
the monster’s size. The typical space and reach for monsters of
each size is given on Table 7–1: Creature Sizes (page 314). Note
that this table does not take into account special situations such as
a roper’s strands.
Special Attacks: A template may add or remove special attacks.
The template description gives the details of any special attacks a
template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs,
if applicable.
Special Qualities: A template may add or remove special qualities. The template description gives the details of any special qualities a template provides, including how to determine saving
throw DCs, if applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from a template description, the creature still gains any qualities associated with its new type (see Chapter 7: Glossary).
Base Saves: As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does
not always change its base saving throw bonuses. You only need to
adjust them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or

Wisdom. A template may, however, state that a monster has a different “good” saving throw—see Table 4–1.
Abilities: If a template changes one or more ability scores,
these changes are noted here.
Skills: As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not
always change its skill points. Most templates don’t change the
number of Hit Dice a creature has, so you don’t need to adjust
skills in that case unless the key abilities for those skills have
changed, or the template gives a bonus on one or more skills, or
unless the template gives a feat that provides a bonus on a skill
check.
Some templates change how skill points are determined, but
this change usually only affects skill points gained after the template is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature’s description
as class skills, as well as any new skills provided by the template.
Feats: Since most templates do not change the number of Hit
Dice a creature has, a template will not change the number of feats
the creature has. Some templates grant one or more bonus feats.
Environment: Usually the same as the base creature.
Organization: Usually the same as the base creature.
Challenge Rating: Most templates increase the creature’s
Challenge Rating. A template might provide a modifier to be
added to the base creature’s CR, or it might specify a range of modifiers depending on the base creature’s original Hit Dice or CR.
Treasure: Usually the same as the base creature.
Alignment: Usually the same as the base creature, unless the
template is associated with a certain alignment (such as the celestial and fiendish templates, and any template that changes a creature’s type to undead).
Advancement: Usually the same as the base creature.
Level Adjustment: This entry is a modifier to the base creature’s level adjustment. Any level adjustment is meaningless
unless the creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum
3) to gain class levels after applying the template.
ADDING A TEMPLATE, STEP-BY-STEP
All the templates presented in this book include at least one
example of the template applied to a creature. To apply a template
to a creature yourself, follow the steps outlined below.
If the template changes the base creature’s size, use Table 4–2 to
determine changes to natural armor, Armor Class, and attack rolls.
Check the text of the template to see if you apply size modifiers to
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The template’s Abilities
entry may already account for those adjustments.
Add all ability score modifiers, from size and from the Abilities
entry, to the base creature’s ability scores.
When you know the new Constitution modifier and any
change to Hit Die size, recalculate the templated monster’s hit
points. See Hit Dice and Hit Points, above.
The new Constitution modifier also modifies the creature’s Fortitude saving throw modifier and any skill modifier for Concentration
checks. Check for Great Fortitude or any other feat that affects the
Fortitude saving throw modifier and apply the change now.
When you know the new Dexterity modifier, recalculate the
creature’s modifier on initiative checks and Armor Class. Apply
modifiers for size and natural armor at this time. Check for
Improved Initiative and any other feat that affects Initiative and
apply the change now.
Check to see if either the base creature or the templated creature uses Weapon Finesse with one or more of its attacks. If it does,
use the new Dexterity modifier to recalculate the attack bonus.
Apply any size modifiers at the same time.
The new Dexterity modifier also modifies the Reflex saving
throw modifier and the modifiers of any skills with Dexterity as
the key ability. Check for Lightning Reflexes or any other feat that
affects the Reflex saving throw modifier and apply the change now.
When you know the new Strength modifier, check to see if
either the base creature or the templated creature has Weapon
Finesse. For all attacks that do not use Weapon Finesse, use the
new Strength modifier to recalculate attack bonus. Apply any size
modifiers at the same time.
The new Strength modifier affects damage and any modifiers
for skills with Strength as the key ability.
When you know the new Intelligence modifier, recalculate
skill modifiers for any skills that use Intelligence as the key ability.
When you know the new Wisdom modifier, recalculate the
Will saving throw modifier and the modifiers for any skills that
use Wisdom as the key ability. Check for Iron Will or any other
feat that affects the Will saving throw modifier and apply the
change now.
For all special abilities of the base creature that remain, recalculate saving throw DCs (the template description tells how to calculate the DCs for any special abilities the template provides). The
formula for most save DCs is 10 + 1/2 the creature’s Hit Dice + the
relevant ability score modifier of the creature using the ability.
Typically, each ability is associated with certain kinds of abilities,
as follows.
Strength: Any application of force, crushing, binding, or constriction.
Dexterity: Movement, movement restrictions, hitting with a
missile, entanglement.
Constitution: Almost anything that comes from the creature’s
body, including poison attacks and breath weapons.
Intelligence: Illusion effects.
Wisdom: Mental or perception effects (except charms and compulsions; see Charisma).
Charisma: A creature’s Charisma modifier affects the save DC
for any spell-like abilities it has. Use Charisma for anything pitting the creature’s will against an opponent, such as gaze attacks,
charms, compulsions, and energy drain effects. Also use Charisma
for any DC that normally would be based on an ability score the
creature does not have. For example, undead have no Constitution
score, so any poison attack an undead creature has would use
Charisma to determine the save DC.
Add any new special abilities granted by the template.
Add any skill bonuses given by the template.
Add any feats given by the template that are not already taken
into account.
Update the Challenge Rating as instructed by the template.
Adding More Than One Template
In theory, there’s no limit to the number of templates you can add
to a creature. To add more than one template, just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited templates before applying acquired templates. Whenever you add multiple templates, pay
attention to the creature’s type—you may add a template that
makes the creature ineligible for other templates you might want
to add. For example, a vampire cannot become a lich and vice versa.
ADVANCED MONSTER
CHALLENGE RATING
When you add higher ability scores, class levels, more Hit Dice, or
a template to a monster, you make it a more challenging opponent
for your players.
When adding class levels to a creature with 1 or less HD, you
advance the creature like a character. Otherwise, use the following
guidelines.
ADDING CLASS LEVELS
If you are advancing a monster by adding player character class
levels, decide if the class levels directly improve the monster’s
existing capabilities.
CHAPTER 4:
ADVANCING
MONSTERS
294
When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it typical ability scores appropriate for that class. Most creatures in this
book are built using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11,
10, 10, 10, adjusted by racial modifiers. If you give a creature a PC
class, such as fighter or druid, use the elite array of ability scores
before racial adjustments: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. For example, the
troll hunter (in the Troll entry) is a ranger and uses the elite array,
which is then modified by the troll’s racial adjustments (Str +12,
Dex +4, Con +12, Int –4, Wis –2, Cha –4). Creatures with NPC
classes, such as adept or warrior, use the nonelite array of 13, 12,
11, 10, 9, 8. The orc warrior presented in this book is an example.
Estimating CR: Assigning a Challenge Rating is a subjective
judgment, not an exact science—meaning that you have control
over what the CR of an monster with class levels should be. If you
find a class combination that improves a monster’s capabilities significantly—or not as significantly as this guideline supposes—
you should modify its CR as seems logical. Err on the side of overestimating: If a monster has a higher Challenge Rating than it
deserves, it’s less likely to kill off an entire party than if you had
erred in the other direction.
Associated Class Levels
Class levels that increase a monster’s existing strengths are known
as associated class levels. Each associated class level a monster has
increases its CR by 1.
Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes for
a creature that relies on its fighting ability. For example, if you add
a level of fighter, barbarian, ranger, or paladin to a frost giant, this
directly improves the monster’s existing strengths and is therefore
an associated class level.
Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on
stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill use to give itself an advantage.
The babau demon, for example, is “sneaky and sly” and has sneak
attack as a special ability. Rogue is an associated class for this creature.
A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already has the ability to cast spells as a character of the class in question, since the monster’s levels in the spellcasting class stack with
its innate spellcasting ability. A rakshasa, for example, casts spells
as a 7th-level sorcerer. If it picks up a level of sorcerer, it casts
spells as an 8th-level sorcerer.
Nonassociated Class Levels
If you add a class level that doesn’t directly play to a creature’s
strength (such as adding a sorcerer level to a frost giant), the class
level is considered nonassociated, and things get a little more
complicated. Adding a nonassociated class level to a monster
increases its CR by 1/2 per level until one of its nonassociated
class levels equals its original Hit Dice. At that point, each additional level of the same class or a similar one is considered associated and increases the monster’s CR by 1.
For example, frost giants have 14 HD. After you add 14 levels of
sorcerer to a frost giant (and +7 to its CR), any further sorcerer
class levels are considered associated. Adding one more sorcerer
level increases this particular frost giant’s CR by 1.
Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.
ADDING HIT DICE
When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice, use Table 4–4 to
determine the effect on the creature’s CR. Keep in mind that many
monsters that advance by adding Hit Dice also increase in size. Do
not stack this CR increase with any increase from class levels.
In general, once you’ve doubled a creature’s CR, you should
closely watch any additional increases in its abilities. Adding Hit
Dice to a creature improves several of its abilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression indefinitely. Compare
the monster’s improved attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and
any DCs of its special abilities from the HD increase to typical
characters of the appropriate level and adjust the CR accordingly.
INCREASING SIZE
Generally, increasing a monster’s size increases its combat effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased Strength, reach, and other
benefits. Apply this modifier if you increase a creature beyond
Medium and in conjunction with any other increases.
Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size
may actually lose effectiveness because of a size increase. A grig,
for example, gains AC and attack bonuses for being Tiny, and
reduced Dexterity from a size increase actually hurts its Weapon
Finesse capability. Monsters that don’t benefit from size increases
don’t advance in that manner for this reason.
ADDING SPECIAL ABILITIES
You can add any sort of spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary
ability to a creature. As with a class level, you should determine
how much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature’s existing
repertoire. A suite of abilities that work together should be treated
as a single modifier for this purpose. If the ability (or combination
of abilities) significantly increases the monster’s combat effectiveness, increase its CR by 2. Minor abilities increase the creature’s
CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not increase CR at all. If the
special abilities a monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die
increase, this CR increase stacks.
A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance of
incapacitating or crippling a character in one round; the troll’s
rend ability, while it is dangerous, does not make it significantly
more dangerous than it already is, but an umber hulk’s confusing
gaze can take characters out of the fight every round. A significant
special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster’s vulnerability to common attacks, such as spell resistance or an
undead creature’s immunities. Do not add this factor twice if a
monster has both special attacks and special qualities.
Make sure to “scale” your evaluation of these abilities by the
monster’s current CR. Giving a CR 15 monster built for melee
combat the ability to cast bull’s strength once per day is pretty trivial, taken all by itself. It probably wouldn’t bump the CR at all, or at
best, by 1. If you give a melee combat monster of CR 1 the same
ability, however, that’s fairly significant: Increase the CR by 2.
Adding lots of abilities is always problematic. Monsters usually
only spend a short period of time “on screen” in any adventure. If
you give a monster more special abilities than it can reliably use in
a single encounter, you may just be increasing complexity for no
real improvement.

CHAPTER 5:
MAKING MONSTERS
All the really great monsters, in the D&D game and in literature,
have one thing in common—you can sum up what they’re all
about in just a few words. That’s the first and most essential item in
any monster recipe—a solid and fairly simple statement of what
the monster is all about.
THE MONSTER’S CONCEPT
Before you begin assigning statistics and other particulars, take some
time to think about the basic nature, or concept, of your monster.
Think about the following when working on your concept:
—What do you expect the creature to do in the game? (Is it a
friend or a foe of the PCs? Does it depend primarily on physical
abilities or mental abilities? Is it meant to be encountered once, or
on a recurring basis?)
—Where does it live? (A monster that lives underground may
have characteristics not shared by monsters that inhabit the
wilderness, and vice versa.)
—How does it live? (Is it a predator that relies on its own
strength and speed, or is it intelligent enough to get other creatures to do its bidding?)
—Does it have any particular enemies or favorite prey?
After you have an idea of what your monster is about, you’ll
have a much easier time making your creature’s type, ability
scores, feats, skills, and special powers fit your concept. It’s okay to
model your new monster on a creature that’s already in the
game—you’ll have less work to do, and your monster will be easier
to use. You’ll find that a short menu of special abilities tightly
wedded to your concept makes the best monster, and it makes the
monster much easier to use.
DETERMINING THE MONSTER’S TYPE
Once you have your monster’s concept figured out, it’s time to
pick a creature type that fits the concept. Use the following information to determine the most appropriate type for your monster
(perhaps refining your concept as you go).
Aberration: An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities,
an alien mindset, or any combination of the three. This type works
best for creatures that are just plain weird. Aberrations have average
combat ability and hit points, but generally poor saving throws.
If you want your aberration to be a tough customer in combat,
you’ll need to give it some sort of special attack ability. For example, a carrion crawler has eight paralyzing tentacle attacks,
while an umber hulk has a gaze that causes confusion.
Animal: An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a
vertebrate with no magical abilities and no innate capacity for language or culture. Animals have average combat ability, average hit
points, and average saving throws.
If your creature ever lived on Earth, and it’s not an insect of
some kind, it’s probably an animal.
Construct: A construct is an animated object or artificially
constructed creature. Constructs have average combat ability and
hit points, and very poor saving throws, but they have immunity
to many attack forms.
Use this type for any creature that was built or made rather than
born or hatched.
Dragon: A dragon is a reptilelike creature, usually winged, with
magical or unusual abilities. This type is exceptionally powerful,
combining good combat ability, hit points, and saving throws.
Use the dragon type for variations on the basic dragon design (a
flying reptile with supernatural abilities). If your creature is essentially just a flying reptile (such as a pterodactyl), the animal or
magical beast type may be more suitable.
Elemental: An elemental is a being composed of one of the
four classical elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Elementals have
average combat ability and hit points and poor saving throws, but
have immunity to some forms of attack.
Use the elemental type for a creature from the elemental planes
that is more element than creature. If your creature is a native of
the elemental planes but more like a living creature than the incarnation of an element, you should probably use the outsider type.
Fey: A fey is a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to some other force or place. Fey are usually
human-shaped. Fey have poor combat ability and hit points and
average saving throws. If you want to create a tough fey, you will
need to assign formidable physical ability scores and special attacks or defenses to make the creature survivable.
Fey creatures include fairies and many sylvan creatures. They
could also include evil creatures such as the sidhe and unseelie
fairies.
Giant: A giant is a humanoid-shaped creature of great strength,
usually of at least Large size. Giants have average combat ability
and hit points, and poor saving throws, but their size and physical
ability scores usually make them very dangerous combatants.
If your creature is humanoid-shaped and at least as big as an
ogre, it’s probably a giant, especially if it doesn’t have a lot of special abilities.
Humanoid: A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and
one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a head. Humanoids have
few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can
speak and usually have well-developed societies. They usually are
Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype,
such as elf, goblinoid, or reptilian.
Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids
of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors, which means that
they have average combat ability and poor saving throws.
Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die (for example, gnolls and
bugbears) are the only humanoids who make use of the features of
the humanoid type. Humanoids have average combat ability and
hit points, but poor saving throws.
Magical Beast: A magical beast is similar to an animal but can
have an Intelligence score higher than 2. Magical beasts usually
have supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but sometimes are
merely bizarre in appearance or habits. Magical beasts have good
combat ability and hit points, and average saving throws.
If your creature resembles an animal but is intelligent or has
supernatural or spell-like abilities, it’s probably a magical beast.
You can also use this type for animallike creatures that combine
the features of two or more animals, or are similar to animals but
just tougher.
Monstrous Humanoid: Monstrous humanoids are similar to
humanoids, but with monstrous or animalistic features. They
often have magical abilities as well. Monstrous humanoids have
good combat ability and average hit points and saving throws.
Use this type for just about anything that combines elements of
human and animal or monster anatomy, unless it is weird enough
to qualify as an aberration. Monstrous humanoids might also
include otherwise humanoid creatures with odd vulnerabilities or
abilities you wouldn’t normally find in a humanoid.
Ooze: An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature, usually
mindless. Oozes have average combat ability, good hit points, and
very poor saving throws, but they have immunity to many forms
of attack.
If your creature has a bizarre physiology that takes the form of a
mindless, amorphous blob, it’s an ooze. Otherwise, it’s probably an
aberration.
Outsider: An outsider is at least partially composed of the
essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other
than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as some other
CHAPTER 5:
MAKING
MONSTERS
296
type and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower)
state of spiritual existence. Outsiders have good combat ability,
average hit points, and good saving throws.
If your creature comes from another plane and it’s not an elemental, it’s an outsider.
Plant: This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note that regular plants, such as one finds growing in gardens and fields, lack
Wisdom and Charisma scores and thus are not creatures, but
objects, even though they are alive. Plant creatures have average
combat ability and hit points and poor saving throws, but have
immunity to many forms of attack.
Undead: Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces. Undead have poor combat ability, average hit points, and poor saving throws, but have immunity to
many forms of attack. If you want to create an undead creature
with formidable combat abilities, you will need to give it high
Strength or Dexterity, or provide it with dangerous special attacks
and defenses.
If it’s dead, but still kicking, it’s undead (although it could be a
construct if it’s just a collection of parts animated through an
arcane process). If the creature has energy drain or ability drain
capability, it is more likely undead than a construct.
Vermin: This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates. Vermin have average
combat ability and hit points and poor saving throws, but are often
mindless and therefore have immunity to mind-affecting effects
(charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
Use this type for giant bugs and other mindless invertebrates. If
your creature has an Intelligence score and you’ve considered the
vermin type, it’s probably a magical beast or an aberration instead.
TARGET CHALLENGE RATING
Before you get too far into designing your monster, you should
decide about how tough a monster you’re trying to build by picking
a target CR. Challenge rating measures the level of characters the
monster will be best suited to oppose. As you assign the monster’s
Hit Dice, Armor Class, attack bonus, special attacks, save DCs, and
other characteristics, you will want to keep your target CR in mind.
For example, if you want to create a monster to challenge a
party of 2nd-level characters, you probably don’t want to create a
monster with an Armor Class of 25. A strong and capable 2ndlevel fighter might have an attack bonus of +6 or so, which means
that the best character in the party will hit your monster only on a
natural 19 or 20. The clerics, rogues, and other characters in the
party will only hit on a natural 20.
If you are interested in creating your own monsters for a particular game or campaign, you have an advantage: You know exactly
what characters your monsters will face. You can examine your
players’ character sheets and check the attack bonus, Armor Class,
and saving throws of the characters you expect your monster to
fight. If you don’t want to tailor your monster to a particular group
of characters, you can use the NPC tables in Chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide to see how characters of a level equal to your
target CR can handle different monster attacks and defenses.
As you proceed through the steps of creating your monster, use
your target CR to guide your decisions about what value to assign.
Your final monster design may or may not match the target CR,
but you will be much less likely to create a monster that never
misses or can’t be hit.
CREATING THE MONSTER
All the other elements of the monster recipe serve to put your concept into words and numbers so you can use the monster in play.
The steps below are not presented in the same order as a monster
entry, because some items that appear late in a monster entry (for
example, the monster’s ability scores) affect decisions you might
make about items that precede them.
CREATURE TYPE
A creature’s type defines what the creature is like and what it can
do in the much the same way as a character’s class defines the character’s abilities. A creature’s type determines the size of its Hit Dice
and how magic affects the creature; for example, the hold animal
spell affects only creatures of the animal type.
Type, along with size, helps determine the monster’s ability
scores and damage values. Consider your concept for the monster,
and choose the type that best matches that concept. Full descriptions of each type’s features and traits appear in Chapter 7: Glossary.
SIZE
A creature’s size affects its combat abilities in numerous ways. In
general, the bigger the creature, the nastier it is. When assigning a
size to your monster, think about your monster concept. Does the
creature need to be really strong and tough? Does it have a voracious appetite? If so, it should be big. Is the creature sneaky, agile,
and easy to overlook? If so, it should be smaller.
It’s important to remember that a creature’s total volume is what
determines its size. If a creature is significantly denser or less
dense than a regular animal, then its weight is a poor indicator of
size. For example, the ghost of a human weighs nothing but is size
Medium.
A creature’s size should influence its ability scores and its
number of Hit Dice. Table 5–1 shows suggested ability scores, Hit
Dice, and natural weapon damage for monsters of various sizes.
These are guidelines, not hard-and-fast requirements. Many creatures in this book do not adhere to the guidelines on the table.
The column headers on Table 5–1 are defined below.
Minimum CR: This column gives the minimum target CR you
should assign to a creature of this size. This reflects the size-based
suggestions for number of HD, Strength, and damage capability.
For example, if you are creating a Gargantuan creature, you should
plan on a final CR of 6 or higher.
Str, Dex, Con: These numbers are typical values for a creature
of the indicated size. The creature’s type influences which end of
the given range a monster falls into; for example, since giants are
often at the high end of the Strength range for their size, a Large
giant’s Strength score should be closer to 27 than 18.
Table 5–1: Creature Size, Ability Scores, and Damage
Minimum Minimum Maximum Slam or Claw or Gore or

CHAPTER 5:

Ability score guidelines for some creature types are given
below.
Elemental: Air and fire elementals often have high Dexterity
scores for their size; earth and water elementals often have high
Constitution scores.
Fey: Fey often have high Dexterity scores for their size.
Giant: Giants often have high Strength and Constitution scores
for their size.
Magical Beast: Magical beasts often have high Dexterity scores
for their size.
Ooze: Oozes often have low Dexterity and high Constitution
scores for their size.
Outsider: Outsiders may be supernaturally quick and agile,
despite their size. Outsiders have the Dexterity range of a creature
three sizes smaller than their actual size.
Plant: Plants often have low Dexterity and high Constitution
scores for their size.
Undead: Undead often have high Strength and Dexterity scores
for their size.
Minimum HD: Creatures of size Small or larger should be
assigned a certain number of Hit Dice as a minimum to reflect
their mass. A Gargantuan creature with 2 Hit Dice would be larger
than an elephant, but would have the hit points of a wolf.
Maximum HD: Creatures of size Tiny or smaller shouldn’t
have a very large number of Hit Dice, simply because they don’t
have the necessary body mass to have the sort of innate toughness
that a large number of racial Hit Dice would suggest. If you want
to create very small creatures with lots of Hit Dice, you might be
better off to keep the creature’s racial Hit Dice low and assign it
some number of character class levels instead.
Slam or Tentacle: The suggested damage value for any blunt
attack the creature might have (punches, constriction, slaps, and
the like).
Bite: The suggested damage value for any attack the creature
delivers with its mouth or teeth.
Claw or Sting: The suggested damage value for any attack the
creature makes by scratching, tearing, raking, or poking with an
appendage.
Gore or Tail: The suggested damage value for any attack the
creature makes with horns, antlers, or a head butt. A tail slap or tail
whip falls in this category, too.
SUBTYPE
A monster associated with an element, form of energy, or the like
also gets a parenthetical subtype. Applying a subtype can indicate
a subgroup within a larger type, such as undead (incorporeal).
Some subtypes link creatures that share characteristics, such as
humanoid (goblinoid). Other subtypes categorize members of different types that share common characteristics For example,
white dragons and frost giants belong to the dragon and giant
types, respectively, but they are also of the cold subtype.
Some common subtypes that affect a creature’s abilities are
briefly described below. Details are given in Chapter 7: Glossary.
Air: The creature (usually an elemental or outsider) possesses
an innate bond to the Elemental Plane of Air.
Angel: The creature belongs to one of the angel races and
shares common characteristics with other angels.
Aquatic: The creature breathes water, not air.
Archon: The creature belongs to one of the archon races and
shares common characteristics with other archons.
Augmented: The creature’s type has been changed by a template.
Baatezu: The creature is a devil that belongs to the baatezu race
and shares common characteristics with other baatezu.
Chaos: The creature (usually an outsider) possesses an innate
bond to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes, which determines how
it is affected by certain spells.
Cold: The creature has immunity to cold, but is vulnerable to
fire attacks.
Earth: The creature (usually an elemental or outsider) possesses an innate bond to the Elemental Plane of Earth.
Eladrin: The creature is a celestial that belongs to the eladrin
race and shares common characteristics with other eladrins.
Evil: The creature (usually an outsider) possesses an innate
bond to the evil-aligned Outer Planes, which determines how it is
affected by certain spells.
Extraplanar: The creature (usually an elemental or outsider) is
not native to the Material Plane, which determines how it is affected by spells that banish or dismiss extraplanar creatures.
Fire: The creature has immunity to fire, but is vulnerable to
cold attacks.
Goblinoid: The creature belongs to one of the goblin races.
Good: The creature (usually an outsider) possesses an innate
bond to the good-aligned Outer Planes, which determines how it
is affected by certain spells.
Guardinal: The creature is a celestial that belongs to the guardinal race and shares common characteristics with other guardinals.
Incorporeal: The creature is completely intangible on the
Material Plane and can pass through solid objects.
Lawful: The creature (usually an outsider) possesses an innate
bond to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes, which determines how it
is affected by certain spells.
Native: Despite its outsider type, the creature is actually a
native of the Material Plane.
Reptilian: The creature is a humanoid with reptilelike characteristics.
Shapechanger: The creature possesses an innate ability to
change shape or assume an alternate form.
Swarm: The creature is actually a swarm of hundreds or thousands of very small creatures.
Tanar’ri: The creature is a demon that belongs to the tanar’ri
race and shares common characteristics with other tanar’ri.
Water: The creature (usually an elemental or outsider) possesses an innate bond to the Elemental Plane of Water.
HIT DICE
This entry in a statistics block provides the number and size (number
of sides) of Hit Dice and any bonus hit points. The size of the dice is
derived from the creature’s type. The number of bonus hit points is a
function of the creature’s Hit Dice and Constitution score.
A parenthetical listing of the creature’s average hit points follows the Hit Dice listing. To calculate a creature’s average hit
points, take the average value of each Hit Die, apply the creature’s
Constitution modifier (a creature always has at least 1 hit point per
Hit Die), multiply by the number of Hit Dice, and round down.
Average Hit Die Values
Die Size Average
1d4 2.5
1d6 3.5
1d8 4.5
1d10 5.5
1d12 6.5
Hit Dice and Target CR: In general, a creature’s Hit Dice
should be equal to or greater than the target CR you’ve set for
the creature, but not more than three times the target CR. For
example, if you are designing a CR 5 monster, you should probably assign at least 5 Hit Dice, but not more than 15 Hit Dice. If
your monster has too few Hit Dice for its Challenge Rating, it
won’t have staying power comparable to other monsters of that
CR. If your monster has too many Hit Dice, not only will it have
more hit points than a creature of that CR should have, but it
will also have a better attack bonus and saving throws than
CHAPTER 5:
MAKING
MONSTERS
298
expected, because those numbers are determined by the creature’s Hit Dice.
Obviously, many monsters break this rule, usually by falling 1
or 2 Hit Dice short of their CR. That’s okay, provided that the monster has special attacks or qualities that make it a suitable challenge at its CR.
ABILITY SCORES
In this entry, a creature’s ability scores are presented in this order:
Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha.
Assigning Abilities: Physical abilities (Strength, Dexterity,
and Constitution) are largely a function of a creature’s type and
size, as shown on Table 5–1. In general, the bigger a creature gets,
the higher its Strength and Constitution scores and the lower its
Dexterity. Exceptions abound.
The remaining abilities (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma)
are seldom related to size. You’ll need to assign values to these abilities to match your concept.
Intelligence: Reflects how well the creature learns and reasons.
In most cases, it affects how many skills and feats the creature has.
A creature needs an Intelligence score of at least 3 to speak a language; anything lower makes the creature no smarter than a typical animal. An Intelligence score of 4 to 7 represents a limited ability to reason and a certain low cunning. An Intelligence score of 8
or 9 approaches the typical human range. A score of 10 or 11
covers the human norm. A score of 12 to 19 reflects above-average
to genius-level Intelligence. A score of 20 or higher represents
superhuman intellect.
Wisdom: Reflects the creature’s level of perception and strength
of will. A creature can have a very low Intelligence score and still
be very wise. A Wisdom score of 3 or lower indicates a creature
that is barely sentient. A score of 4 to 6 represents Wisdom equivalent to that of an unusually foolhardy or unperceptive human. A
score of 16 to 18 reflects acute senses and unusual guile. A score of
20 or higher represents superhuman perceptiveness.
Charisma: Reflects the creature’s sense of self and ability to
influence other creatures for good or for ill (a particularly scary
creature often has a high Charisma score). A creature can have a
very low Intelligence score and still be very charismatic. A
Charisma score of 3 or lower indicates a creature that is barely sentient. A score of 4 to 6 represents Charisma equivalent to that of a
strikingly sullen, crass, or retiring human. A score of 16 to 18
reflects an unusually strong presence and force of personality. A
score of 20 or higher represents superhuman Charisma.
Nonabilities: Some creatures lack one or more ability scores.
In most cases, a nonability is an advantage for the creature. Note
that all creatures must have both a Wisdom score and a Charisma
score. Anything that lacks Wisdom or Charisma is an object, not a
creature (though it may be alive, such as a tree or a sponge).
INITIATIVE
This entry gives the creature’s modifier to initiative rolls. The
bonus is most commonly derived from the creature’s Dexterity
modifier and the Improved Initiative feat (if the creature has it).
SPEED
This entry gives the creature’s base land speed in feet per move action.
All speeds must be evenly divisible by 5 feet. Most creatures have base
land speeds of between 20 and 40 feet. Larger creatures and
quadrupeds tend to be faster, and predators or creatures noted for
their fast movement could have a speed of up to 60 to 80 feet. Compare the speeds of monsters similar to your monster concept to pick a
suitable value. See Table 5–2 for some guidelines and suggestions.
If the creature has other modes of movement, list all that apply
after the base land speed in alphabetical order. If the creature wears
armor that reduces its speed, it’s helpful to give its reduced movement rate in a parenthetical note following the base land speed.
ARMOR CLASS
All creatures start with a base Armor Class of 10, which is modified by the creature’s size, Dexterity, armor (including natural
armor), and shield. Some creatures, such as incorporeal monsters,
may also have a deflection bonus to their Armor Class.
Consider the creature’s anatomy and overall toughness when
you choose an Armor Class for your monster. The table below
shows some typical values for natural armor.
Touch Armor Class: To figure your monster’s Armor Class against
touch attacks, add only its size modifier, Dexterity modifier, and
deflection bonus (if any) to its base AC of 10.
Flat-Footed Armor Class: To figure your monster’s Armor Class
when it is caught flat-footed, include all the normal elements
except the creature’s Dexterity bonus.
Don’t forget to include the creature’s size modifier in your final
Armor Class calculation. If the creature wears armor, its natural
armor bonus stacks with the bonus provided by its armor. For
example, a centaur is a Large creature with a Dexterity score of 14
(+2 bonus to AC) and +2 natural armor. If the centaur carries a
heavy shield and wears a chain shirt, its Armor Class is 19 (–1 size,
+2 Dex, +2 natural, +2 heavy shield, +4 chain shirt).
Armor Class and Target CR: Too high an Armor Class may
make your monster unbeatable at the Challenge Rating you’re
aiming for. Too low, and the monster won’t be a challenge at all. A
good rule of thumb is to arrange the components of a creature’s AC
to arrive at a total Armor Class equal to 13 + target CR. For example, if you’d like your monster to be about CR 8, you should aim
for AC 21. Naturally, you can choose to make a monster somewhat
more soft-skinned if it has other defenses (damage reduction, for
example), or you might choose to make your monster an unusually tough target for its CR by giving it “extra” armor.

CHAPTER 5:
MAKING
MONSTERS

ATTACK
Decide what attack forms the creature uses in melee and ranged
combat and determine the monster’s attack bonus with each
attack. The attacks you might decide to give a creature include:
—Melee weapon (possibly multiple melee weapons)
—Ranged weapon
—Bite
—Claw or tentacle
—Slam
—Gore
—Touch attack
Attack Bonus: A creature’s attack bonus consists of the following components: base attack bonus (as determined by the creature’s type and Hit Dice), size modifier, and Strength modifier for
melee attacks or Dexterity modifier for ranged attacks. You may
select feats or equipment for the monster that alter the creature’s
attack bonus with a particular weapon; for example, if you give the
monster a +2 longsword, you will increase its attack bonus with that
weapon by 2 points. Similarly, Weapon Focus or Weapon Finesse
might alter the creature’s attack bonus.
The Attack entry in a statistics block gives the attack and
damage bonus for each of the monster’s attacks, if the monster
decides to use a standard action to make a single attack. You do not
need to account for secondary weapons or multiple attacks with
the same weapon when you describe the monster’s individual
attack options here—any weapon the monster uses to make a
single attack as a standard action gets the monster’s full attack
bonus and damage bonus for Strength.
Damage: Assign damage values to each of the creature’s natural
attacks. The base damage value depends on the creature’s size and
the type of attack, as shown on Table 5–1.
Particularly tough or weak creatures might have higher or
lower damage values. In general, you can vary the power of a monster’s attacks by moving up or down one or two lines on the table.
For example, a Medium monster’s bite usually has a damage value
of 1d6, but it could be as little as 1d3 or as much as 2d6. Use the
1d3 value for a creature with a very small or weak mouth, or the
2d6 value to represent a creature with large or very powerful
mouth.
Natural Weapons: A creature’s attack gets the creature’s full
damage bonus from Strength, or 1-1/2 times the Strength bonus if
it is the creature’s sole natural weapon.
If any of the creature’s attacks also have some special effect
other than damage (poison, disease, energy drain, paralyzation,
and so forth), note it after the attack’s hit point damage—for
example, sting (1d6 plus poison).
Critical Hits: Unless you decide otherwise, a creature’s natural
attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of natural 20 and deals
double damage if a critical hit is confirmed. Very few monsters
have better than normal threat ranges or critical multipliers with
their natural weapons.
Weapon-Using Creatures: Creatures that use weapons follow all
the rules that characters do; two-handed weapons gain 1-1/2 times
the creature’s Strength bonus on damage rolls.
Attack Bonus and Target CR: Much like Armor Class, a monster’s attack bonus may make it unplayable at the Challenge
Rating you intend. A monster without a high enough attack bonus
poses no threat to the PCs, and a monster with too high an attack
bonus never misses.
As a guideline, arrange the components of a monster’s attack
bonus so that its attack bonus with its primary weapon is equal to
(target CR × 1.5) + 2. For example, if you are building a CR 5 monster, an appropriate attack bonus would be (5 × 1.5) + 2, or 9.5,
which comes out to an attack bonus of +9 or +10. This guideline
works best for monsters with few special attacks; if you expect
your monster will rely on special attacks rather than pure melee
ability, a better guideline would be an attack bonus equal to (target
CR × 1.5) – 1. A CR 5 monster of this sort would have an attack
bonus of +6 or +7.
Manipulating your monster’s attack bonus to fit the CR you
have in mind is not quite as easy as manipulating Armor Class. You
can change the creature’s Hit Dice, since base attack bonus is
derived from Hit Dice, but doing this will change several other
characteristics. The best way to fine-tune your monster at this step
is to change its Strength score (or Dexterity, for ranged attacks),
but watch out for creating ability scores that seem unusually low
or high for a creature of the given size and type.
FULL ATTACK
In this step, you’ll determine the monster’s attack routine when it
uses a full-round action to make a full attack. This is based on the
individual attacks the monster has available to it (see Attack,
above), but you need to account for the difference between primary and secondary attacks.
Natural Weapons: In general, a creature attacks once with
each natural weapon it has. For most monsters, that will be two
claws and a bite (or the other way around). Decide which of the
monster’s natural weapons is its primary weapon. A monster
many have two or more primary weapons if it has two or more
of the same natural attack—for example, a treant attacks with
two slams, one for each limb, and both are primary natural
weapons.
Primary weapons use a creature’s full attack bonus, no matter
how many primary weapons it has. The monster applies its full
Strength bonus on damage rolls with its primary natural weapons,
or 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus if the monster has only one primary natural weapon (for example, a wolf ’s bite).
All other natural weapons are secondary attacks. Reduce the
creature’s attack bonus by 5 for all such attacks, no matter how
many there are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a –2
penalty on secondary attacks. A monster applies 1/2 its Strength
bonus on damage rolls with its secondary natural weapons.
Manufactured Weapons: Creatures that use weapons follow
all the rules characters that do, including multiple attacks with the
same weapon and penalties for using two weapons at once.
Natural and Manufactured Weapons: If a creature has both
a manufactured weapon and natural weapons, it usually uses its
manufactured weapon as its primary attack (and receives multiple attacks with that weapon, if its base attack bonus is +6 or
higher), and uses its natural weapons as secondary attacks (–5
penalty on attack rolls, and 1/2 Strength bonus on damage rolls).
While a humanoid fighting with two weapons takes a –2 penalty
(or worse) on its primary attack, a monster fighting with a handheld weapon and a natural weapon at the same times does not
take this penalty—the natural weapon is a secondary attack, and
that’s all.
SPECIAL ATTACKS
Decide what special attacks (if any) your monster has. A special
attack is anything the creature uses offensively to harm or hinder
another creature. Common special attacks include:
—Ability damage (temporary)
—Ability drain (permanent)
—Breath weapon
—Change shape
—Constrict
—Cursed wound
—Disease
—Energy drain (negative levels)
—Fear
—Gaze
—Improved grab
—Paralysis
—Poison

—Pounce
—Powerful charge
—Psionics
—Ray
—Rend
—Roar
—Sonic attack
—Spells
—Spell-like abilities
—Summon
—Swallow whole
—Trample
—Wounding
Most of these special attacks are described in detail in Chapter
7: Glossary. A number of monsters possess unusual special attacks
that are less common (for example, the mind flayer’s mind blast
and extract attacks). In general, one or two special attacks for any
monster is enough—monsters usually don’t get the chance to use
more than a couple of special abilities in the course of a single encounter, so creating a number of special attacks simply makes the
monster more difficult to use in play.
Each special attack should include the type of saving throw the
attack allows (if any) and the DC of the save. The saving throw
type depends on the nature of the attack, as follows:
—Fortitude saving throws apply to attacks on the defender’s
vitality: poison, magic that causes instant death, level draining, or
magic that causes physical transformation.
—Reflex saving throws apply to massive attacks such as a
wizard’s fireball or a damage-dealing breath weapon.
—Will saving throws apply to mental influence and domination as well as any magical effect that doesn’t fall into one of the
previous two categories.
Calculating Saving Throw DCs
The formula for save DCs is: 10 + 1/2 the creature’s Hit Dice + relevant ability score modifier. The relevant ability score depends on
the type of attack, as follows:
Strength: Any application of force, crushing, binding, or constriction. Example: trample.
Dexterity: Movement, movement restrictions, hitting with a
missile, entanglement. Example: entangle.
Constitution: Almost anything that comes from the creature’s body,
such as poison or breath weapons. Examples: breath weapon, poison.
Intelligence: Usually not used to determine save DCs for monsters’ special attacks. Possible uses: illusion effects.
Wisdom: Usually not used to determine save DCs for monsters’
special attacks. Possible uses: Mental or perception effects (except
charms and compulsions; see Charisma).
Charisma: Use Charisma for anything pitting the creature’s will
against an opponent: gaze attacks, charms, compulsions, or energy
drain. The creature’s Charisma modifier affects the save DC for any
spell-like abilities it has (no matter what form they take).
Also use Charisma for any DC that normally would be based on
an ability score the creature does not have. For example, undead
creatures have no Constitution score, so any poison attacks they
have would use Charisma to determine the save DC.
SPECIAL QUALITIES
A special quality is any ability a creature can use to protect itself.
The Special Qualities entry also is the catch-all for anything the
creature might do or have that does not logically belong somewhere else. Common special qualities include:
—Blindsense
—Blindsight
—Damage reduction
—Fast healing
—Frightful presence
—Immunity to energy or a certain attack form
—Regeneration
—Resistance to energy
—Scent
—Spell immunity
—Spell resistance
—Subtype features (for example, cold subtype)
—Tremorsense
—Turn resistance
—Type traits (for example, construct traits)
These abilities are described in Chapter 7: Glossary. A number
of monsters have less common special qualities that are not listed
here. As with special attacks, limit the number of special qualities
you give a monster, because you’ll have an easier time running the
monster in play.
SAVING THROWS
Determine the creature’s saving throw bonuses. The creature’s base
saving throw bonuses depend on its type and Hit Dice. Include all
adjustments that apply to each save, provided they apply all the
time (such as ability score modifiers and racial bonuses). Conditional saving throw bonuses should be noted in the creature’s Special Qualities entry and explained in the creature’s description.
Saving Throws and Target CR: In general, a creature’s good
saving throw bonus should be around (target CR × 1.5), while its
BEHIND THE CURTAIN:
SPELL RESISTANCE AND DAMAGE REDUCTION
Too much spell resistance or damage reduction can make a monster
virtually unbeatable at the Challenge Rating you’re aiming for. Too little,
and the monster might as well not have any at all, since any character
will have the caster level or magic weaponry necessary to penetrate the
creature’s defense.
Spell Resistance: If you choose to give your monster this ability,
you’ll probably want to set the resistance number equal to the creature’s CR + 11. This means that a character of a level equal to the creature’s will have a 50% chance to overcome the monster’s spell resistance (barring the Spell Penetration feat). For example, a 12th-level
character has a 50% chance to overcome spell resistance 23, so 23 is
a good spell resistance number for a CR 12 creature.
You may need to adjust a creature’s spell resistance number after
you finally settle on a CR for the creature.
If you want a highly magic-resistant creature, set the monster’s spell
resistance higher than CR + 11. For lesser resistance, set the spell
resistance lower. For each point of difference, you’ll change the chance
of successfully overcoming spell resistance by 5%. For example, a 12thlevel caster has a 45% chance to overcome spell resistance 24, and no
chance to overcome spell resistance 33.
Damage Reduction: Assigning a damage reduction value can be
tricky. Setting the value too high can make a creature virtually immune
to physical attacks, On the other hand, most player characters carry
some magic weapons, so setting the value too low can result in an ineffective ability.

poor saving throws should be roughly equal to its target CR. For
example, if you are designing a CR 6 monster, a good save bonus of
+9 and a poor save bonus of +6 should give the monster a decent
chance to save against the player characters’ attacks without making their attacks ineffectual.
The easiest way to manipulate a creature’s save bonuses is to
assign a feat that increases a save bonus (for example, Iron Will). If
you don’t want to give the monster the feat, but you still want to
increase the save bonus, then you need to adjust the ability score
from which the save bonus is derived.
SKILLS
Assign whatever skills you think the creature ought to have. The
number of skill points a creature has depends on its type, Hit Dice,
and Intelligence; see Table 5–4. Assume that any skill you choose
for the creature is a class skill, and each rank costs 1 skill point.
The maximum rank for any skill is the creature’s Hit Dice + 3. A
creature with less than 1 Hit Die is treated as having 1 Hit Die for
the purpose of determining skill points and maximum skill rank.
Table 5–4: Skill Points by Monster Type
Type Skill Points
Aberration (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) × (HD+3)
Animal (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) × (HD+3)
Construct* (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) × (HD+3)
Dragon (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) × (HD+3)
Elemental (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) × (HD+3)

Vermin* (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) × (HD+3)
* Mindless creatures receive no skill points or feats.
** Or by character class.
It is important to consider your concept when assigning skills. Creatures that live by hunting need Hide, Spot, and Listen, and probably
Move Silently. Creatures that use spells or spell-like abilities need
Concentration and probably Spellcraft. Creatures that do not have a
climb or swim speed may benefit from Climb or Swim. Skills such
as Balance and Escape Artist can be useful for almost any creature.
A creature’s final skill modifier consists of: skill ranks + ability
modifier + size modifier (for Hide) + movement mode modifier
(for Climb, Jump, or Swim) + racial bonuses (if any) + synergy
bonuses (if any) + armor check modifier (if any). You may decide
to purchase feats that change the creature’s skill modifiers, too.
Conditional Bonuses: If the creature has conditional ability
adjustments, do not apply them in the Skills entry. Instead, mark
the skill modifier with an asterisk and note the conditional modifier in the creature’s description.
Racial Skill Bonuses: Often a creature will need a better skill
modifier than its abilities and skill points allow. In such cases, it’s a
good idea to assign it a racial bonus (which is effective all the time), or
a specific circumstance bonus. For example, most big cats get bonuses
on Hide and Move Silently checks, and even larger conditional
bonuses on Hide and Move Silently checks when they’re in the right
terrain. They’d have a hard time surviving as predators without them.
FEATS
All monsters have a number of feats equal to 1 + (1 per 3 HD).
Monsters must meet the prerequisites for feats, just as characters
must. If your creature concept begs for a feat for which the creature does not qualify, consider altering the creature so that it qualifies for the feat, or assign the feat as a bonus feat. (It is acceptable
for a creature to have a bonus feat for which it does not meet the
prerequisites.)
Assign feats with your creature concept in mind, just as you did
for skills. For example, spellcasting creatures can benefit from
Combat Casting. Creatures that depend on their senses to locate
prey or alert them to danger can benefit from Alertness. Creatures
that attack from ambush can use Improved Initiative. Any creature can benefit from the feats that improve saving throws (Great
Fortitude, Lightning Reflexes, and Iron Will).
Weak creatures can often benefit from Weapon Finesse,
which allows a creature to use its Dexterity bonus on melee
attacks (very useful for Small, Tiny, and Diminutive creatures).
Likewise, very big or strong creatures benefit from Power Attack,
which allows them to convert points from their attack bonus
into extra damage.
SPACE/REACH
This entry describes how much space the creature takes up on the
battle grid and needs to fight effectively, as well as how close it has
to be to an opponent to threaten that opponent.
A creature’s Space/Reach entry depends on its size, as shown on
Table 7–1: Creature Sizes (page 314). A creature’s space is always a
square area, no matter what the creature’s shape or anatomy is like.
For example, an ogre and a horse have the same space figure (10
feet), because they’re both Large creatures.
Tall creatures (bipeds, usually) have a longer reach than long
creatures. For example, a horse has a reach of 5 feet, but an ogre
has a reach of 10 feet because it is taller.
Some creatures have exceptional reach due to a particular weapon choice or a quirk of anatomy. It’s all right to assign a special
reach figure that applies to a particular attack (such as the roper’s
strands).
ENVIRONMENT
Consider where the creature lives and choose a preferred climate
(warm, temperate, or cold) and terrain (plains, hills, forest, marsh,
mountains, or desert). Your monster is not restricted to that combination of climate and terrain, but it’s the setting the monster is
most likely to be encountered in.
Creatures that have no place in the natural environment (particularly constructs and undead) usually have an entry of “Any.”
Extraplanar outsiders should be assigned a plane of origin.
TREASURE
Most creatures will have no treasure (None) or standard treasure.
Very intelligent creatures might have double or triple treasure.
Some creatures may collect only certain types of treasure. See
Table 3–5, page 52 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
ALIGNMENT
What alignment does your monster have? Choose lawful, neutral,
or chaotic, followed by good, neutral, or evil. All alignments have
a qualifier: always, usually, or often. See page 305 for details.
SKILLS THE QUICK WAY
Instead of fretting about each skill point, an easy way to assign skills to
a monster is to simply buy a number of skills, all at the creature’s maximum ranks. The number of individual skills a creature can choose this
way is equal to its Intelligence modifier plus the base number of skill
points a creature of its type receives per HD. For example, undead have
skill points equal to (4 + Int modifier) at each HD, so an undead creature with an Intelligence score of 15 (Int modifier +2) could simply
p
select six skills at maximum rank.

CHAPTER 5:
MAKING
MONSTERS
302
ADVANCEMENT
This entry provides a measure of how tough the creature can get if
you decide to increase its Hit Dice. In general, a creature should
be able to have up to three times its original Hit Dice (that is, a 3
HD creature should be able to advance up to 9 HD).
Most creatures will get larger if you add a lot of Hit Dice, so you
should pick a break point at which the creature’s size changes. For
example, the Advancement entry for a Large plant creature with 3
Hit Dice might read: 4–5 HD (Large); 6–9 HD (Huge). See Table
5–1 for guidelines on size and Hit Dice.
Some monster types don’t have obvious break points between
size categories. In these cases, you probably want to set the break
point between sizes at 1/2 the maximum Hit Dice to be added. For
example, a Large aberration with 4 HD could advance to 12 HD.
Since you’re adding up to 8 Hit Dice, the creature’s Advancement
entry might read: 5–8 HD (Large); 9–12 (Huge).
CHALLENGE RATING
This shows what level of party for which the creature would make
a good encounter of moderate difficulty. A party of four fresh
characters (full hit points, full spells, and an assortment of equipment appropriate to their levels) should be able to win the
encounter with some damage, but no casualties, given reasonable
luck. This victory should consume no more than 20% of the party
resources (hit points, spells, and consumable magic items).
Assigning an appropriate Challenge Rating can be difficult. The
two basic tools for determining CR are comparing and playtesting.
Comparing CR
The simplest and quickest way to estimate your monster’s Challenge Rating is to compare it to similar monsters in an appropriate
CR range. Begin with the target CR you used in constructing your
monster. Use the list of Monsters by Challenge Rating (see page
318) to compile a list of monsters whose CRs match your monster’s CR, plus or minus 1. For example, if your target CR is 7, you
should closely examine monsters of CR 6, 7, and 8.
To narrow your list, look for monsters with similar types or similar methods (bruisers, spell-like ability users, special attack users,
and so on). Once you’ve reduced your list of comparable monsters
to a manageable number, see how your monster compares to the
others, using the following checklist:
—Does your monster have more or less Hit Dice?
—Does your monster have a better or worse Armor Class?
—Does your monster have a higher or lower attack bonus?
—Does your monster deal more or less damage?
—Does your monster have more deadly special attacks?
—Does your monster have spell-like abilities whose highest
spell level is lower or higher than the spell-like abilities of comparable monsters?
—Does your monster have special defenses the other monsters
don’t have?
If your monster is clearly superior to most of the comparable
monsters, your target CR is probably too low. Try adjusting the CR
up by 1 or 2, then find a new list of monsters that should be comparable at the new CR and see how your monster stacks up. If your
monster is clearly not as tough as most of the comparable monsters, reduce your CR by 1 or 2 and find a new list of comparable
monsters to check your monster against.
Playtesting CR
The best way to set a monster’s CR is to see how it handles in play.
This can be time-consuming, but it probably gives you the best
information about how challenging your monster is.
To playtest a monster’s CR, use the following procedure:
1. Create a “playtest party” consisting of four characters whose
level equals your monster’s target CR + 2. Each character should
be built using the standard ability score array and equipment for a
PC of their level. Include a fighter, rogue, cleric, and wizard if possible. You can use copies of your players’ characters for this, but if
your PCs are unusual, your results will be skewed.
2. Create a representative encounter for the monster that uses
two of the creatures (two monsters of CR X is an appropriate
encounter for four PCs of level X+2). For simple monsters, a room
and a door should suffice, but if your monster is built to ambush
parties or make good use of a particular terrain, you should probably check the monster in the sort of environment you expect to
use when you employ the monster in a real game session.
3. Allow the PCs to begin the encounter with spells or effects
whose duration is measured at 10 minutes per level or longer in
effect.
4. Assign all combatants an initiative roll of 10, modified by
their normal initiative modifiers (for playtests, you want everyone
to take 10 on their initiative roll).
5. Run the encounter several times and try different tactics and
setups for the monsters.
If your proposed CR is appropriate, the PCs should be able to win
the encounter with some damage, given reasonable luck. This victory should consume no more than 20% of the party resources (hit
points, spells, and consumable magic items). In the case of highCR monsters (say, 11 or more), an occasional PC death is not out of
line with the monster’s CR, since parties of that level can usually
bring dead characters back to life pretty easily.
If your monster seems too dangerous, try the encounter again
with a single monster; this lets you see how the monster looks as a
solitary combatant whose CR is equal to the party’s level. If the
party handles the monster with no trouble, try increasing the
number of monsters to three or four (which would effectively
lower the monster’s CR by 1 or 2). You may need to adjust the
party’s level and try the monster again at its new CR.
Monster Function and Challenge Rating
A quick and dirty way to double-check your CR assignment is to
compare your monster’s Hit Dice against its CR. Depending on
their function, monsters need a high number of Hit Dice for their
CR, a low amount of Hit Dice for their CR, or an average amount.
Evaluate your monster and decide what its basic function is: battler, ambusher, magic user, special attack user, or multiple threat.
Battler: The monster uses sheer combat skill to threaten the
party and has few special abilities. Examples: dire animal (any),
giant (any), gray render, minotaur, shambling mound, worg. A battler’s CR should be from 1/3 its HD to 2/3 its HD.
Ambusher: The monster depends on stealth or surprise attacks
to threaten the party. Examples: assassin vine, choker, derro,
mimic, phase spider, roper. An ambusher’s CR should be from 1/2
its HD to its HD.
Magic User: The monster’s best attacks are its spells or spelllike abilities. Examples: aboleth, lamia, lillend, mind flayer,
nymph. A magic user’s CR should be from about its HD to its HD
+2, provided the spells it can employ would be appropriate for a
spellcasting character whose level is about the same as the monster’s Hit Dice. (If they’re less than expected, your monster is probably better described as an ambusher or battler.)
Special Attack User: The monster is dangerous because of a
special attack it can employ. Examples: basilisk, dragon (any),
harpy, medusa, wraith, vampire. A special attack user’s CR should
be from 2/3 its HD to its HD.
Multiple Threat: The monster combines two or more of the
previous functions. For example, many demons and devils combine battler and magic user functions, while a mind flayer combines magic user and special attack user functions. Dragons with
significant spellcasting ability frequently combine battler, magic
user, and special attack user functions. A multiple threat’s CR
should be from about 3/4 its HD to its HD +2.

SKILLS AND FEATS
This chapter provides descriptions of one skill, Control Shape, and
a number of feats that are typically used only by monsters.
CONTROL SHAPE (WIS)
Any character who has contracted lycanthropy and is aware of his
condition can learn Control Shape as a class skill. (An afflicted
lycanthrope not yet aware of his condition can attempt Control
Shape checks untrained.) This skill determines whether an
afflicted lycanthrope can control his shape. A natural lycanthrope
does not need this skill, since it has full control over its shape.
Check (Involuntary Change): An afflicted character must
make a check at moonrise each night of the full moon to resist
involuntarily assuming animal form. An injured character must
also check for an involuntary change after accumulating enough
damage to reduce his hit points by one-quarter and again after
each additional one-quarter lost.
Involuntary Change Control Shape DC
Resist involuntary change 25
On a failed check, the character must remain in animal form until
the next dawn, when he automatically returns to his base form. A
character aware of his condition may make one attempt to return
to humanoid form (see below), but if he fails, he remains in animal
form until the next dawn.
Retry (Involuntary Change): Check to resist an involuntary
change once each time a triggering event occurs.
Check (Voluntary Change): In addition, an afflicted lycanthrope aware of his condition may attempt to use this skill voluntarily in order to change to animal form, assume hybrid form, or
return to humanoid form, regardless of the state of the moon or
whether he has been injured.
Involuntary Change Control Shape DC
Return to humanoid form (full moon*) 25
Return to humanoid form (not full moon) 20
Assume hybrid form 15
Voluntary change to animal form (full moon) 15
Voluntary change to animal form (not full moon) 20
* For game purposes, the full moon lasts three days every month.
Retry (Voluntary Change): A character can retry voluntary
changes to animal form or hybrid form as often as he likes. Each
attempt is a standard action. However, on a failed check to return
to humanoid form, the character must remain in animal or hybrid
form until the next dawn, when he automatically returns to
humanoid form.
Special: An afflicted lycanthrope cannot attempt a voluntary
change until it becomes aware of its condition (see Lycanthropy as
an Affliction, page 178).
ABILITY FOCUS [GENERAL]
Choose one of the creature’s special attacks. This attack becomes
more potent than normal.
Prerequisite: Special attack.
Benefit: Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against the special attack on which the creature focuses.
Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time the creature takes the feat, it applies to a
different special attack.
AWESOME BLOW [GENERAL, FIGHTER]
The creature can choose to deliver blows that send its smaller
opponents flying like bowling pins.
Prerequisites: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush, size
Large or larger.
Benefit: As a standard action, the creature may choose to subtract 4 from its melee attack roll and deliver an awesome blow. If
the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an
awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC
= damage dealt) or be knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the
attacking creature’s choice and fall prone. The attacking creature
can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent
can’t move closer to the attacking creature than the square it
started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points
of damage, and the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the
obstacle.
CRAFT CONSTRUCT [ITEM CREATION]
The creature can create golems and other magic automatons that
obey its orders.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous
Item.
Benefit: A creature with this feat can create any construct
whose prerequisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes one
day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct, a
spellcaster must spend 1/25 the item’s price in XP and use up raw
materials costing half of this price (see the Golem, Homunculus,
and Shield Guardian monster entries for details).
A creature with this feat can repair constructs that have taken
damage. In one day of work, the creature can repair up to 20 points
of damage by expending 50 gp per point of damage repaired.
A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit
Dice.
EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]
The creature can use a spell-like ability with greater effect than
normal.
Prerequisite: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject
to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an
empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the
ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).
When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by onehalf. An empowered spell-like ability does half again as much
damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half
again as many targets, and so on as appropriate. For example, a
night hag’s empowered magic missile deals 1-1/2 times normal
damage (roll 1d4+1 and multiply the result by 1-1/2 for each missile). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when
a character casts dispel magic) are not affected. Spell-like abilities
without random variables are not affected.
The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a
spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round
down) –2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the
Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat. For example, a creature that uses
its spell-like abilities as a 13th-level caster can only empower spelllike abilities duplicating spells of 4th level or lower.
Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is
taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like
abilites.
FLYBY ATTACK [GENERAL]
The creature can attack on the wing.
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action
(including a dive) and another standard action at any point during
the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a
round when it makes a flyby attack.
Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard action
either before or after its move.
CHAPTER 6:
SKILLS AND
FEATS
304
HOVER [GENERAL]
The creature can come to a halt in midair.
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefit: When flying, the creature can halt its forward motion
and hover in place as a move action. It can then fly in any direction, including straight down or straight up, at half speed, regardless of its maneuverability.
If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place for
the turn and take a full-round action. A hovering creature cannot
make wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and
appendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead
use a breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical
attacks, if it could normally do so.
If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of the
ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings
creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds
so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns,
and other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. Clear vision
within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment
at 15 to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures
have total concealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot
use sight to locate the creature).
Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration
check (DC 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD) to cast a spell.
Normal: Without this feat, a creature must keep moving while
flying unless it has perfect maneuverability.
IMPROVED NATURAL ARMOR [GENERAL]
The creature’s natural armor is thicker and harder than that of
others of its kind.
Prerequisites: Natural armor, Con 13.
Benefit: The creature’s natural armor bonus increases by 1.
Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. Each time
the creature takes the feat, its natural armor bonus increases by
another point.
IMPROVED NATURAL ATTACK [GENERAL]
The creature’s natural attacks are more dangerous than its size and
type would otherwise dictate.
Prerequisite: Natural weapon, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s natural attack forms. The
damage for this natural weapon increases by one step, as if the
creature’s size had increased by one category: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6,
1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. A weapon or attack that deals
1d10 points of damage increases as follows: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8,
6d8, 8d8, 12d8.
MULTIATTACK [GENERAL]
The creature is adept at using all its natural weapons at once.
Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.
Benefit: The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons
take only a –2 penalty.
Normal: Without this feat, the creature’s secondary attacks
with natural weapons take a –5 penalty.
MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING [GENERAL]
A creature with three or more hands can fight with a weapon in
each hand. The creature can make one extra attack each round
with each extra weapon.
Prerequisites: Dex 13, three or more hands.
Benefit: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced
by 2 with the primary hand and reduced by 6 with off hands.
Normal: A creature without this feat takes a –6 penalty on
attacks made with its primary hand and a –10 penalty on attacks
made with its off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the
others are off hands.) See Two-Weapon Fighting, page 160 of the
Player’s Handbook.
Special: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for
creatures with more than two arms.
QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]
The creature can employ a spell-like ability with a moment’s thought.
Prerequisite: Spell-like ability at caster level 10th or higher.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject
to the restrictions described below. The creature can use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if
the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).
Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not
provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action—including the use of another spell-like ability—in
the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round.
The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a
spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round
down) –4. For a summary, see the table below. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 15th-level caster can only
quicken spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 3rd level or lower.
In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting
time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.
Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a standard
action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless noted otherwise.
Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is
taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like
abilities.

SNATCH [GENERAL]
The creature can grab opponents much smaller than itself and
hold them in its mouth or claw.
Prerequisite: Size Huge or larger.
Benefits: The creature can choose to start a grapple when it hits
with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the improved grab special
attack. If the creature gets a hold on a creature three or more sizes
smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw damage. A
snatched opponent held in the creature’s mouth is not allowed a
Reflex save against the creature’s breath weapon, if it has one.
The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free action
or use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels
1d6×10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled. If
the creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the opponent takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.
WINGOVER [GENERAL]
The creature can change direction quickly while flying.
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefits: A flying creature with this feat can change direction
quickly once each round as a free action. This feat allows it to turn
up to 180 degrees regardless of its maneuverability, in addition to
any other turns it is normally allowed. A creature cannot gain altitude during a round when it executes a wingover, but it can dive.
The change of direction consumes 10 feet of flying movement.

CHAPTER 7: GLOSSARY
This chapter provides definitions and descriptions of monster
characteristics. If you come across a term earlier in this book that
you’re not familiar with, this is the place to find out more.
Aberration Type: An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange
abilities, an alien mindset, or any combination of the three.
Features: An aberration has the following features.
—d8 Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—Good Will saves.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: An aberration possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Proficient with its natural weapons. If generally humanoid in
form, proficient with all simple weapons and any weapon it is described as using.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or
heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Aberrations not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with
armor. Aberrations are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
—Aberrations eat, sleep, and breathe.
Ability Score Loss (Su): Some attacks reduce the opponent’s
score in one or more abilities. This loss can be temporary (ability
damage) or permanent (ability drain).
Ability Damage: This attack damages an opponent’s ability score.
The creature’s descriptive text gives the ability and the amount of
damage. If an attack that causes ability damage scores a critical hit,
it deals twice the indicated amount of damage (if the damage is
expressed as a die range, roll two dice). Ability damage returns at
the rate of 1 point per day for each affected ability.
Ability Drain: This effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s ability score when the creature hits with a melee attack. The
creature’s descriptive text gives the ability and the amount
drained. If an attack that causes ability drain scores a critical hit, it
drains twice the indicated amount (if the damage is expressed as a
die range, roll two dice). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points
(10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains an ability score no matter
how many points it drains. Temporary hit points gained in this
fashion last for a maximum of 1 hour.
Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2
draining creature’s racial HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier;
the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). If no
saving throw is mentioned, none is allowed.
Alternate Form (Su): A creature with this special quality has
the ability to assume one or more specific alternate forms. This
ability works much like the polymorph spell, except that the creature is limited to the forms specified, and does not regain any hit
points for changing its form. Assuming an alternate form results
in the following changes to the creature:
—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form.
It gains the size of its new form.
—The creature loses the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.
—The creature gains the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.
—The creature retains the special qualities of its original form.
It does not gain any special qualities of its new form.
—The creature retains the spell-like abilities and supernatural
attacks of its old form (except for breath weapons and gaze
attacks). It does not gain the spell-like abilities or supernatural
attacks of its new form.
—The creature gains the physical ability scores (Str, Dex, Con)
of its new form. It retains the mental ability scores (Int, Wis, Cha)
of its original form.
—The creature retains its hit points and save bonuses,
although its save modifiers may change due to a change in ability
scores.
—The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak intelligibly to cast
spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands
to cast spells with somatic components.
—The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its
new form, and it gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if it uses
this ability to create a disguise.
Air Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elementals and
outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane Air. Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability (see the section on Movement, page 311).
Alignment: This line in a monster entry gives the alignment
that the creature is most likely to have. Every entry includes a
qualifier that indicates how broadly that alignment applies to all
monsters of that kind.
Always: The creature is born with the indicated alignment. The
creature may have a hereditary predisposition to the alignment or
come from a plane that predetermines it. It is possible for individuals to change alignment, but such individuals are either unique
or rare exceptions.
Usually: The majority (more than 50%) of these creatures have
the given alignment. This may be due to strong cultural influences, or it may be a legacy of the creatures’ origin. For example,
most elves inherited their chaotic good alignment from their creator, the deity Corellon Larethian.
Often: The creature tends toward the given alignment, either by
nature or nurture, but not strongly. A plurality (40–50%) of individuals have the given alignment, but exceptions are common.
Angel Subtype: Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. In the D&D cosmology, these planes are the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia,
the Twin Paradises of Bytopia, the Olympian Glades of Arborea,
the Blessed Fields of Elysium, and the Wilderness of the Beastlands.
Traits: An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.
—Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.
— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.
—Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created
by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC
and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20
feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil
effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet
(caster level equals angel’s HD). (The defensive benefits from the
circle are not included in an angel’s statistics block.)
—Tongues (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has
a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to
angel’s Hit Dice). This ability is always active.
Animal Type: An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical abilities and no innate capacity
for language or culture.
Features: An animal has the following features (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
306
—d8 Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—Good Fortitude and Reflex saves (certain animals have different good saves).
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: An animal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence
score of 3 or higher can be an animal).
—Low-light vision.
—Alignment: Always neutral.
—Treasure: None.
—Proficient with its natural weapons only. A noncombative herbivore uses its natural weapons as a secondary attack. Such attacks are
made with a –5 penalty on the creature’s attack rolls, and the animal
receives only 1/2 its Strength modifier as a damage adjustment.
—Proficient with no armor unless trained for war.
—Animals eat, sleep, and breathe.
Aquatic Subtype: These creatures always have swim speeds
and thus can move in water without making Swim checks. An
aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air
unless it has the amphibious special quality.
Archon Subtype: Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia.
Traits: An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons
that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius
of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The
save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and
includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on
attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit
the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or
broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s
aura for 24 hours.
—Immunity to electricity and petrification.
— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.
—Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil
effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon’s
Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included
in an archon’s statistics block.)
—Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the
spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only
itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.
—Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that
has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level 14th).
This ability is always active.
Augmented Subtype: A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with this subtype;
others acquire it when they take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type.
For example, a wizard’s raven familiar is a magical beast (augmented animal). A creature with the augmented subtype usually
has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.
For example, a wizard’s raven familiar has an animal’s features and
the traits of a magical beast.
Baatezu Subtype: Many devils belong to the race of evil outsiders known as the baatezu.
Traits: A baatezu possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
—Immunity to fire and poison.
—Resistance to acid 10 and cold 10.
—See in Darkness (Su): All baatezu can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell.
—Summon (Sp): Baatezu share the ability to summon others of
their kind (the success chance and type of baatezu summoned are
noted in each monster description).
—Telepathy.
Blindsense (Ex): Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell
or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things it cannot see.
The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks
to pinpoint the location of a creature within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any
opponent the creature cannot see still has total concealment
against the creature with blindsense, and the creature still has the
normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.
Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense.
A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to
Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.
Blindsight (Ex): This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far
more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to
vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature
with blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature.
Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or
object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does
not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within
range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight
is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some
forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If
so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature must
trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of
blindsight only during its turn.
Breath Weapon (Su): A breath weapon attack usually deals
damage and is often based on some type of energy (such as fire).
Such breath weapons allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 +
1/2 breathing creature’s racial HD + breathing creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A
creature is immune to its own breath weapon unless otherwise
noted. Some breath weapons allow a Fortitude save or a Will save
instead of a Reflex save.
Change Shape (Su): A creature with this special quality has the
ability to assume the appearance of a specific creature or type of
creature (usually a humanoid), but retains most of its own physical
qualities. A creature cannot change shape to a form more than one
size category smaller or larger than its original form. Changing
shape results in the following changes to the creature:
—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form.
It gains the size of its new form.
—The creature loses the natural weapons, movement modes,
and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.
—The creature gains the natural weapons, movement modes,
and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.
—The creature retains all other special attacks and qualities of
its original form, except for breath weapons and gaze attacks.
—The creature retains the ability scores of its original form.
—The creature retains its hit points and saves.
—The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak intelligibly to cast
spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands
to cast spells with somatic components.
—The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
307
new form, and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if it uses this
ability to create a disguise.
Chaotic Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsiders
native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that
have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their
alignments change they still retain the subtype. Any effect that
depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the
creature has a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment
actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual
alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes
damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it
wields were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).
Class Skills: Any skill in which a monster has acquired at least
one rank or in which the creature has a racial bonus is considered
a class skill for that kind of creature. Some monsters, such as the
true dragons, have their class skills explicitly listed. Other monsters’ class skills can be determined from their statistics blocks.
Creatures with a Swim speed always have Swim as a class skill.
Creatures with a Climb speed always have Climb as a class skill.
Skills listed in an entry merely because of synergy with another
skill are not class skills. For example, a marilith’s class skills are
Bluff, Concentration, Diplomacy, Hide, Intimidate, Listen, Move
Silently, Search, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Spot, and Use Magic
Device. Even though Disguise and Survival are mentioned in the
creature’s statistics block, their presence is exclusively due to the
synergy benefit granted by Bluff and Search.
Cold Subtype: A creature with the cold subtype has immunity
to cold. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again
as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether
a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
Constrict (Ex): A creature with this special attack can crush an
opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after making a successful
grapple check. The amount of damage is given in the creature’s
entry. If the creature also has the improved grab ability (see page
310), it deals constriction damage in addition to damage dealt by
the weapon used to grab.
Construct Type: A construct is an animated object or artificially constructed creature.
Features: A construct has the following features.
—10-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—No good saving throws.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, if the construct has an Intelligence score. However, most constructs are
mindless and gain no skill points or feats.
Traits: A construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—No Constitution score.
—Low-light vision.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromancy effects.
—Cannot heal damage on their own, but often can be repaired
by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see the creature’s
description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct
feat (see page 303). A construct with the fast healing special quality still benefits from that quality.
—Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage,
ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.
—Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless
the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).
—Not at risk of death from massive damage (see page 145 of the
Player’s Handbook). Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit
points or less.
—Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.
—Because its body is a mass of unliving matter, a construct is
hard to destroy. It gains bonus hit points based on size, as shown
on the following table.
Bonus Bonus
Construct Size Hit Points Construct Size Hit Points
Fine — Large 30
Diminutive — Huge 40
Tiny — Gargantuan 60
Small 10 Colossal 80
Medium 20
—Proficient with its natural weapons only, unless generally
humanoid in form, in which case proficient with any weapon
mentioned in its entry.
—Proficient with no armor.
—Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe.
Damage Reduction (Ex or Su): A creature with this special
quality ignores damage from most weapons and natural attacks.
Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly
(in either case, the opponent knows the attack was ineffective).
The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.
A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature normally, as noted below.
The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to
15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the ability. For
example, the werewolf ’s entry reads “damage reduction 10/silver”:
Each time a foe hits a werewolf with a weapon, the damage dealt
by that attack is reduced by 10 points (to a minimum of 0). However, a silvered weapon deals full damage.
Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or
slashing damage. For example, skeletons have damage reduction
5/bludgeoning. When hit with slashing or piercing weapons, the
damage dealt by each attack is reduced by 5 points, but bludgeoning weapons deal full damage.
Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as
alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron. Attacks from
weapons that are not made of the correct material have their
damage reduced, even if the weapon has an enhancement bonus.
Examples: the werewolf ’s damage reduction 10/silver, the iron
golem’s damage reduction 15/adamantine, and the nymph’s damage reduction 10/cold iron.
Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon
with at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls overcomes the damage reduction of these monsters. Such
creatures’ natural weapons (but not their attacks with weapons)
are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction. For example, the gargoyle has damage reduction 10/magic and can strike as a magic weapon for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
A few very powerful monsters, such as the solar and the tarrasque, are vulnerable only to epic weapons; that is, magic weapons with at least a +6 enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ natural
weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawfulaligned weapons. When a cleric casts align weapon, affected weapons might gain one or more of these properties, and certain magic
weapons have these properties as well. For example, many tanar’ri
demons and baatezu devils have damage reduction 10/good, while

many celestials have damage reduction 10/evil. A creature with an
alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome
this type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had an alignment (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of the creature. A
bearded devil, for instance, has the evil and lawful subtypes, and
thus can overcome damage reduction as if its weapons and natural
weapons were evil-aligned and lawful-aligned.
When a damage reduction entry has a dash (–) after the slash,
no weapon negates the damage reduction.
A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon.
The babau demon, for example, has damage reduction 10/cold
iron or good. Either kind of weapon—cold iron or good—overcomes its damage reduction.
A few other creatures require combinations of different types of
attacks to overcome their damage reduction. The ghaele eladrin has
damage reduction 10/evil and cold iron, meaning that a weapon must
be made of cold-forged iron and be evil-aligned in order to overcome
the ghaele’s damage reduction. A lich has damage reduction 15/bludgeoning and magic, meaning that only bludgeoning weapons with at
least a +1 enhancement bonus deal full damage to it. A weapon that
falls into one category but not the other is of no help in overcoming
the creature’s damage reduction—a magic sword or a nonmagical
mace is no better at harming a lich than any other weapon.
Dragon Type: A dragon is a reptilelike creature, usually
winged, with magical or unusual abilities.
Features: A dragon has the following features.
—12-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).
—Good Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves.
—Skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: A dragon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in the description of a particular kind).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Immunity to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects.
—Proficient with its natural weapons only unless humanoid in
form (or capable of assuming humanoid form), in which case proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its
entry.
—Proficient with no armor.
—Dragons eat, sleep, and breathe.
Earth Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elementals and
outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Earth
creatures usually have burrow speeds, and most earth creatures
can burrow through solid rock.
Effective Character Level (ECL): This number represents a
creature’s overall power relative to that of a character from the
Player’s Handbook. A creature with an ECL of 10 is roughly equivalent to a 10th-level character. A creature’s ECL is the sum of its Hit
Dice (including class levels) and level adjustment. For instance, a
minotaur has 6 HD and a +2 level adjustment. It is the equivalent
of an 8th-level character.
Eladrin Subtype: Eladrins are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the the Olympian Glades of Arborea.
Traits: An eladrin possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Immunity to electricity and petrification.
—Resistance to cold 10 and fire 10.
—Tongues (Su): All eladrins can speak with any creature that
has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level 14th).
This ability is always active.
Elemental Type: An elemental is a being composed of one of
the four classical elements: air, earth, fire, or water.
Features: An elemental has the following features.
—8-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—Good saves depend on the element: Fortitude (earth, water)
or Reflex (air, fire).
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: An elemental possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning.
—Not subject to critical hits or flanking.
—Unlike most other living creatures, an elemental does not
have a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit. When an elemental is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their
bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate,and resurrection, don’t work on
an elemental. It takes a different magical effect, such as limited
wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection, to restore it to life.
—Proficient with natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with all simple weapons
and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or
heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.
Elementals not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with
armor. Elementals are proficient with shields if they are proficient
with any form of armor.
—Elementals do not eat, sleep, or breathe.
Energy Drain (Su): This attack saps a living opponent’s vital
energy and happens automatically when a melee or ranged attack
hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative
levels (the creature’s description specifies how many). If an attack
that includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice
the given amount. Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s
description, a draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10
on a critical hit) for each negative level it bestows on an opponent.
These temporary hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour.
An affected opponent takes a –1 penalty on all skill checks and
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses one effective
level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die roll or calculation)
for each negative level. A spellcaster loses one spell slot of the highest level of spells she can cast and (if applicable) one prepared spell of
that level; this loss persists until the negative level is removed.
Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they
are removed with a spell, such as restoration. If a negative level is
not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature
must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s
racial HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given
in the creature’s descriptive text). On a success, the negative level
goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative
level goes away, but the creature’s level is also reduced by one. A
separate saving throw is required for each negative level.
Environment: This entry in a statistics block describes the
type of climate and terrain where the creature is typically found.
This is a preference, but is not exclusionary. Note that these environments can also exist in portions of dungeons due to magical
effects or other supernatural interference, or as features in dungeons or other environment areas. Chapter 5 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide has details on climate and terrain types.
Evil Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsiders
native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are also
called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil
alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
309
the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no
matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers
effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the evil
subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons
and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).
Extraplanar Subtype: A subtype applied to any creature when
it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels
the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to
plane. This book assumes that encounters with creatures take
place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane
is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would
not have when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in
this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. These
home planes are taken from the Great Wheel cosmology of the
D&D game (see Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). If your
campaign uses a different cosmology, you will need to assign different home planes to extraplanar creatures.
Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the Material
Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the
Material Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is
on a transitive plane; the transitive planes in the D&D cosmology
are the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.
Fast Healing (Ex): A creature with the fast healing special
quality regains hit points at an exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or
more hit points per round, as given in the creature’s entry (for
example, a vampire has fast healing 5). Except where noted here,
fast healing is just like natural healing (see page 146 of the Player’s
Handbook). Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a creature to
regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow
lost body parts to be reattached.
Favored Class: A monster that takes levels in a class (or more
than one class) has a favored class, just as player characters do. In
addition, a monster’s racial Hit Dice also count as a favored class,
in effect: If the monster becomes a multiclass character, neither its
favored class nor its racial Hit Dice count when determining
whether the creature takes an experience point penalty.
Fear (Su or Sp): Fear attacks can have various effects.
Fear Aura (Su): The use of this ability is a free action. The aura
can freeze an opponent (such as a mummy’s despair) or function
like the fear spell (for example, the aura of a lich). Other effects are
possible. A fear aura is an area effect. The descriptive text gives the
size and kind of area.
Fear Cones (Sp) and Rays (Su): These effects usually work like the
fear spell.
If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC 10 +
1/2 fearsome creature’s racial HD + creature’s Cha modifier; the
exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). All fear attacks
are mind-affecting fear effects.
Fey Type: A fey is a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to some other force or place. Fey are usually
human-shaped.
Features: A fey has the following features.
—6-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).
—Good Reflex and Will saves.
—Skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: A fey possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
—Low-light vision.
—Proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or
heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.
Fey not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor.
Fey are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form
of armor.
—Fey eat, sleep, and breathe.
Fire Subtype: A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to
fire. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half again as
much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a
saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
Flight (Ex or Su): A creature with this ability can cease or
resume flight as a free action. If the ability is supernatural, it
becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the creature loses
its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic effect persists.
Frightful Presence (Ex):This special quality makes a creature’s
very presence unsettling to foes. It takes effect automatically
when the creature performs some sort of dramatic action (such as
charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents within range who
witness the action may become frightened or shaken.
Actions required to trigger the ability are given in the creature’s descriptive text. The range is usually 30 feet, and the duration is usually 5d6 rounds.
This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels
than the creature has. An affected opponent can resist the effects
with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful creature’s racial
HD + frightful creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in
the creature’s descriptive text). An opponent that succeeds on the
saving throw is immune to that same creature’s frightful presence
for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Gaze (Su): A gaze special attack takes effect when opponents
look at the creature’s eyes. The attack can have almost any sort of
effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical range is
30 feet, but check the creature’s entry for details.
The type of saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a
Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD +
gazing creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s
descriptive text). A successful saving throw negates the effect. A monster’s gaze attack is described in abbreviated form in its description.
Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a
saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the
initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with a gaze
attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the
need to make the saving throw by not looking at the creature, in
one of two ways.
Averting Eyes: The opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face,
instead looking at its body, watching its shadow, tracking it in a
reflective surface, and so on. Each round, the opponent has a 50%
chance to not need to make a saving throw against the gaze attack.
The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains concealment
against that opponent.
Wearing a Blindfold: The opponent cannot see the creature at all
(also possible to achieve by turning one’s back on the creature or
shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze attack gains total
concealment against the opponent.
A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack
action by choosing a target within range. That opponent must
attempt a saving throw but can try to avoid this as described above.
Thus, it is possible for an opponent to save against a creature’s gaze
twice during the same round, once before the opponent’s action
and once during the creature’s turn.
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
310
Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless otherwise noted.
Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All the
creature’s allies are considered to be averting their eyes from the
creature with the gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to
make a saving throw against the gaze attack each round. The creature also can veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.
Giant Type: A giant is a humanoid-shaped creature of great
strength, usually of at least Large size.
Features: A giant has the following features.
—8-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—Good Fortitude saves.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: A giant possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
—Low-light vision.
—Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as any
natural weapons.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium or
heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Giants
not described as wearing armor are not proficient with armor.
Giants are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any
form of armor.
—Giants eat, sleep, and breathe.
Goblinoid Subtype: Goblinoids are stealthy humanoids who
live by hunting and raiding and who all speak Goblin.
Good Subtype: A subtype usually applied only to outsiders
native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have
this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends
on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature
has a good alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The
creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A
creature with the good subtype overcomes damage reduction as if
its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were good-aligned
(see Damage Reduction, above).
Guardinal Subtype: Guardinals are a race of celestials, or good
outsiders, native to the the Blessed Fields of Elysium.
Traits: A guardinal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Immunity to electricity and petrification.
—Resistance to cold 10 and sonic 10.
—Lay on Hands (Su): As the paladin class feature, except that
each day, a guardinal can heal an amount of damage equal to its full
normal hit points.
— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.
—Speak with Animals (Su): This ability works like speak with
animals (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require
sound.
Humanoid Type: A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs,
and one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a head. Humanoids
have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most
can speak and usually have well-developed societies. They usually
are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype,
such as elf, goblinoid, or reptilian.
Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors, which means
that they have average combat ability and poor saving throws.
Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die (for example, gnolls and
bugbears) are the only humanoids who make use of the features of
the humanoid type.
Features: A humanoid has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—Good Reflex saves (usually; a humanoid’s good save varies).
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, or by character class.
Traits: A humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Proficient with all simple weapons, or by character class.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or
heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class. If a humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, it is proficient with that
type of armor and all lighter types. Humanoids not indicated as
wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Humanoids are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
—Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.
Improved Grab (Ex): If a creature with this special attack hits
with a melee weapon (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals normal
damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (see Grapple, page 155 of the Player’s
Handbook). No initial touch attack is required.
Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature. The
creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply
use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the
opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a –20 penalty on
grapple checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the creature
does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and
can use its remaining attacks against other opponents.
A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the constrict special attack. If the creature does not
constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during successive
rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that
established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as
well (the amount is given in the creature’s descriptive text).
When a creature gets a hold after an improved grab attack, it
pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke attacks
of opportunity. It can even move (possibly carrying away the
opponent), provided it can drag the opponent’s weight.
Incorporeal Subtype: An incorporeal creature has no physical
body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic
weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells,
spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all
nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal
source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects
such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons).
Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not
affecting an incorporeal creature.
An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a
deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even
if the creature’s Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).
An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects,
but must remain adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so cannot
pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own.
It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square
adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is
inside an object. In order to see farther from the object it is in and
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
311
attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks
a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside
with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal
creature cannot pass through a force effect.
An incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural
armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force
effects (such as mage armor) work normally against it. Incorporeal
creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in
air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can they
be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action
that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor
are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no
weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.
An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard
with Listen checks if it doesn’t wish to be. It has no Strength score,
so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its
ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are
either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.
Lawful: A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to
the lawful-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if their alignments
change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on
alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has
a lawful alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The
creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A
creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as
if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were lawfulaligned (see Damage Reduction, above).
Level Adjustment: Certain monsters can used as the basis for
interesting, viable player characters. These creatures have a level
adjustment entry, which is a number that is added to the creature’s
total Hit Dice to arrive at its effective character level. A creature
with multiple special abilities is more powerful as a player character than its Hit Dice alone would indicate. For example, a drow elf
has spell resistance, bonuses to its ability scores, and spell-like
abilities. Its level adjustment of +2 indicates that a 1st-level drow
wizard is the equivalent of a 3rd-level character.
Some creatures’ level adjustment entries include the word
“(cohort).” Although these creatures may be problematic as PCs,
they make good companions for a character who has taken the
Leadership feat. Some other creatures aren’t intended for use as
PCs or cohorts but can become companions through the use of
the Improved Familiar feat. In these cases, the level adjustment
entry is a dash followed by the words “(Improved Familiar).”
Level adjustment is not the same thing as an adjustment to a
creature’s Challenge Rating because of some special qualities it
possesses. Challenge Rating reflects how difficult an opponent is
to fight in a limited number of encounters. Level adjustment
shows how powerful a creature is as a player character or cohort in
campaign play. For instance, a drow receives a +1 adjustment to its
Challenge Rating to account for its special abilities, indicating
that it’s tougher in a fight than its Hit Dice would suggest, but its
level adjustment is +2 to balance its abilities over long-term play.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): A creature with low-light vision can
see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and
similar conditions of shadowy illumination. It retains the ability
to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Magical Beast Type: Magical beasts are similar to animals but
can have Intelligence scores higher than 2. Magical beasts usually
have supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but sometimes are
merely bizarre in appearance or habits.
Features: A magical beast has the following features.
—10-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).
—Good Fortitude and Reflex saves.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: A magical beast possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
—Proficient with its natural weapons only.
—Proficient with no armor.
—Magical beasts eat, sleep, and breathe.
Manufactured Weapons: Some monsters employ manufactured weapons when they attack. Creatures that use swords, bows,
spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters, including
those for additional attacks from a high base attack bonus and
two-weapon fighting penalties. This category also includes “found
items,” such as rocks and logs, that a creature wields in combat—
in essence, any weapon that is not intrinsic to the creature.
Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manufactured weapons when they make a full attack. When they do so, the
manufactured weapon attack is considered the primary attack
unless the creature’s description indicates otherwise (using the
manufactured weapon consumes most of the creature’s attention),
and any natural weapons the creature also uses are considered secondary natural attacks. These secondary attacks do not interfere
with the primary attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon
does, but they take the usual –5 penalty (or –2 with the Multiattack feat) for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used is normally the creature’s primary natural weapon.
Monstrous Humanoid Type: Monstrous humanoids are similar to humanoids, but with monstrous or animalistic features.
They often have magical abilities as well.
Features: A monstrous humanoid has the following features.
—8-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).
—Good Reflex and Will saves.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: A monstrous humanoid possesses the following traits
(unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or
heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Monstrous humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Monstrous humanoids are proficient with
shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
—Monstrous humanoids eat, sleep, and breathe.
Movement Modes: Creatures may have modes of movement
other than walking and running. These are natural, not magical,
unless specifically noted in a monster description.
Burrow: A creature with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt,
but not through rock unless the descriptive text says otherwise.
Creatures cannot charge or run while burrowing. Most burrowing
creatures do not leave behind tunnels other creatures can use
(either because the material they tunnel through fills in behind
them or because they do not actually dislocate any material when
burrowing); see the individual creature descriptions for details.
Climb: A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all
Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
312
wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it always can choose to
take 10 (see Checks without Rolls, page 65 of the Player’s Handbook),
even if rushed or threatened while climbing. The creature climbs at
the given speed while climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb
(see the Climb skill, page 69 of the Player’s Handbook), it moves at
double the given climb speed (or its base land speed, whichever is
lower) and makes a single Climb check at a –5 penalty. Creatures
cannot run while climbing. A creature retains its Dexterity bonus
to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a climbing creature.
Fly: A creature with a fly speed can move through the air at the
indicated speed if carrying no more than a light load; see Carrying
Capacity, page 161 of the Player’s Handbook. (Note that medium
armor does not necessarily constitute a medium load.) All fly speeds
include a parenthetical note indicating maneuverability, as follows:
—Perfect: The creature can perform almost any aerial maneuver it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a human moves
over smooth ground.
—Good: The creature is very agile in the air (like a housefly or
a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as readily as those
with perfect maneuverability.
—Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird.
—Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.
—Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.
A creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack works
just like a charge, but the diving creature must move a minimum
of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make only claw or
talon attacks, but these deal double damage. A creature can use the
run action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line.
For more information, see Tactical Aerial Movement, page 20 of
the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Swim: A creature with a swim speed can move through water at
its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial
bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid
a hazard. The creature can always can choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or endangered. The creature can use the
run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
Native Subtype: A subtype applied only to outsiders. These
creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the
Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just
as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are
native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype’s name).
Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.
Natural Weapons: Natural weapons are weapons that are physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee attack with a
natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke attacks
of opportunity. Likewise, it threatens any space it can reach.
Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base attack bonus when using natural weapons. The number of attacks a
creature can make with its natural weapons depends on the type
of the attack—generally, a creature can make one bite attack, one
attack per claw or tentacle, one gore attack, one sting attack, or one
slam attack (although Large creatures with arms or armlike limbs
can make a slam attack with each arm). Refer to the individual
monster descriptions.
Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical
hit on a natural attack roll of 20.
When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of
them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary weapon.
All the creature’s remaining natural weapons are secondary.
The primary weapon is given in the creature’s Attack entry, and
the primary weapon or weapons is given first in the creature’s Full
Attack entry. A creature’s primary natural weapon is its most effective natural attack, usually by virtue of the creature’s physiology,
training, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a primary natural weapon uses the creature’s full attack bonus. Attacks
with secondary natural weapons are less effective and are made
with a –5 penalty on the attack roll, no matter how many there are.
(Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature
makes a single attack with the secondary weapon as part of the
attack action or as an attack of opportunity.
Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most
common are summarized below.
Bite: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing,
slashing, and bludgeoning damage.
Claw or Talon: The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing
piercing and slashing damage.
Gore: The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or
similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.
Slap or Slam: The creature batters opponents with an appendage,
dealing bludgeoning damage.
Sting: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in addition to
hit point damage.
Tentacle: The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.
Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores. These
creatures do not have an ability score of 0—they lack the ability
altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects of
nonabilities are detailed below.
Strength: Any creature that can physically manipulate other
objects has at least 1 point of Strength.
A creature with no Strength score can’t exert force, usually because it has no physical body (a spectre, for example) or because it
doesn’t move (a shrieker). The creature automatically fails
Strength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity
modifier to its base attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.
Dexterity: Any creature that can move has at least 1 point of
Dexterity.
A creature with no Dexterity score can’t move (a shrieker, for
example). If it can perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies its Intelligence modifier to initiative checks instead of a Dexterity modifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex saves and
Dexterity checks.
Constitution:Any living creature has at least 1 point of Constitution.
A creature with no Constitution has no body (a spectre, for example) or no metabolism (a golem). It is immune to any effect that
requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on objects or is
harmless. For example, a zombie is unaffected by any type of
poison but is susceptible to a disintegrate spell. The creature is also
immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and
automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature with no Constitution cannot tire and thus can run indefinitely without tiring
(unless the creature’s description says it cannot run).
Intelligence: Any creature that can think, learn, or remember has
at least 1 point of Intelligence.
A creature with no Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton
operating on simple instincts or programmed instructions. It has
immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) and automatically fails Intelligence checks.
Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although they
may have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.
Wisdom: Any creature that can perceive its environment in any
fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom.
Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature.
Anything without a Wisdom score also has no Charisma score.
Charisma: Any creature capable of telling the difference
between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1 point of
Charisma.
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
313
Anything with no Charisma score is an object, not a creature.
Anything without a Charisma score also has no Wisdom score.
Ooze Type: An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature, usually mindless.
Features: An ooze has the following features.
—10-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—No good saving throws.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, if the ooze
has an Intelligence score. However, most oozes are mindless and
gain no skill points or feats.
Traits: An ooze possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
—Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mindaffecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).
—Blind (but have the blindsight special quality), with immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms
that rely on sight.
—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and
stunning.
—Some oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to objects. In
such a case, the amount of damage is equal to 10 + 1/2 ooze’s HD +
ooze’s Con modifier per full round of contact.
—Not subject to critical hits or flanking.
—Proficient with its natural weapons only.
—Proficient with no armor.
—Oozes eat and breathe, but do not sleep.
Outsider Type: An outsider is at least partially composed of the
essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other
than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as some other
type and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower)
state of spiritual existence.
Features: An outsider has the following features.
—8-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).
—Good Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves.
—Skill points equal to (8 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.
Traits: An outsider possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have
a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit. When an outsider
is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies,
such as raise dead, reincarnate,and resurrection, don’t work on an outsider. It takes a different magical effect, such as limited wish, wish,
miracle, or true resurrection to restore it to life. An outsider with the
native subtype (see page 312) can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.
—Proficient with all simple and martial weapons and any
weapons mentioned in its entry.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or
heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with
armor. Outsiders are proficient with shields if they are proficient
with any form of armor.
—Outsiders breathe, but do not need to eat or sleep (although
they can do so if they wish). Native outsiders breathe, eat, and sleep.
Paralysis (Ex or Su): This special attack renders the victim
immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any
physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and
helpless. Paralysis works on the body, and a character can usually
resist it with a Fortitude saving throw (the DC is given in the creature’s description). Unlike hold person and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a new save each round. A winged creature
flying in the air at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings
and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.
Plant Type: This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note that
regular plants, such as one finds growing in gardens and fields,
lack Wisdom and Charisma scores (see Nonabilities, above) and
are not creatures, but objects, even though they are alive.
Features: A plant creature has the following features.
—8-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—Good Fortitude saves.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, if the plant
creature has an Intelligence score. However, some plant creatures
are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.
Traits: A plant creature possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Low-light vision.
—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and
stunning.
—Not subject to critical hits.
—Proficient with its natural weapons only.
—Proficient with no armor.
—Plants breathe and eat, but do not sleep.
Poison (Ex): Poison attacks deal initial damage, such as ability
damage (see page 305) or some other effect, to the opponent on a
failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted, another saving
throw is required 1 minute later (regardless of the first save’s
result) to avoid secondary damage. A creature’s descriptive text
provides the details.
A creature with a poison attack is immune to its own poison and
the poison of others of its kind.
The Fortitude save DC against a poison attack is equal to 10 +
1/2 poisoning creature’s racial HD + poisoning creature’s Con
modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text).
A successful save avoids (negates) the damage.
Pounce (Ex): When a creature with this special attack makes a
charge, it can follow with a full attack—including rake attacks if
the creature also has the rake ability.
Powerful Charge (Ex): When a creature with this special
attack makes a charge, its attack deals extra damage in addition to
the normal benefits and hazards of a charge. The amount of
damage from the attack is given in the creature’s description.
Psionics (Sp): These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates with the power of its mind. Psionic abilities are usually
usable at will.
Racial Hit Dice: The Hit Dice a monster has by virtue of what
type of creature it is. Hit Dice gained from taking class levels are
not racial Hit Dice. For example, the mind flayer sorcerer
described in this book is a 17 HD creature because of its nine
levels of sorcerer, but it has 8 racial Hit Dice (the same number as
a typical mind flayer without any class levels).
Rake (Ex): A creature with this special attack gains extra natural attacks when it grapples its foe. Normally, a monster can attack
with only one of its natural weapons while grappling, but a monster with the rake ability usually gains two additional claw attacks
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
314
that it can use only against a grappled foe. Rake attacks are not
subject to the usual –4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon
in a grapple.
A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grappling to
use its rake—it can’t begin a grapple and rake in the same turn.
Ray (Su or Sp): This form of special attack works like a ranged
attack (see Aiming a Spell, page 175 of the Player’s Handbook). Hitting with a ray attack requires a successful ranged touch attack
roll, ignoring armor, natural armor, and shield and using the creature’s ranged attack bonus. Ray attacks have no range increment.
The creature’s descriptive text specifies the maximum range,
effects, and any applicable saving throw.
Regeneration (Ex): A creature with this ability is difficult to
kill. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as nonlethal damage.
The creature automatically heals nonlethal damage at a fixed rate
per round, as given in the entry (for example, a troll has regeneration 5). Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal lethal
damage to the creature, which doesn’t go away. The creature’s
descriptive text describes the details.
A regenerating creature that has been rendered unconscious
through nonlethal damage can be killed with a coup de grace (see
page 153 of the Player’s Handbook). The attack cannot be of a type
that automatically converts to nonlethal damage.
Attack forms that don’t deal hit point damage (for example, most
poisons and disintegration) ignore regeneration. Regeneration also
does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.
Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies
and can reattach severed limbs or body parts; details are in the
creature’s descriptive text. Severed parts that are not reattached
wither and die normally.
A creature must have a Constitution score to have the regeneration ability.
Reptilian Subtype: These creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe a set of
humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that are truly reptiles.
Resistance to Energy (Ex): A creature with this special quality
ignores some damage of the indicated type each time it takes damage of that kind (commonly acid, cold, fire, or electricity). The
entry indicates the amount and type of damage ignored. For
example, a lillend has resistance to fire 10, so it ignores the first 10
points of fire damage dealt to it anytime it takes fire damage.
Scent (Ex): This special quality allows a creature to detect
approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of
smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors
just as humans do familiar sights.
The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of
smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if
downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above.
Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench,
can be detected at triple normal range.
When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source
is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The
creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent.
Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the source’s location.
A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow
tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or
follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what
kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases
depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold,
the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for
the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of
surface conditions and poor visibility.
Shapechanger Subtype: A shapechanger has the supernatural
ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature
that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype.
Traits: A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—Proficient with its natural weapons, with simple weapons,
and with any weapons mentioned in the creature’s description.
—Proficient with any armor mentioned in the creature’s
description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if it is proficient with any type
of armor.
Size: The nine size categories are (in ascending order) Fine,
Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and
Colossal. A creature’s size provides a modifier to its Armor Class
and attack bonus, a modifier on grapple checks it attempts, and a
modifier on Hide checks. Table 7–1: Creature Sizes provides a
summary of the attributes that apply to each size category.
Sonic Attacks (Su): Unless otherwise noted, a sonic attack follows the rules for spreads (see Aiming a Spell, page 175 of the
Player’s Handbook). The range of the spread is measured from the
creature using the sonic attack. Once a sonic attack has taken effect, deafening the subject or stopping its ears does not end the
effect. Stopping one’s ears ahead of time allows opponents to avoid
having to make saving throws against mind-affecting sonic
attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks (such as those that

GLOSSARY

deal damage). Stopping one’s ears is a full-round action and
requires wax or other soundproof material to stuff into the ears.
Special Abilities: A special ability is either extraordinary (Ex),
spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su).
Extraordinary: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical, don’t
become ineffective in an antimagic field, and are not subject to any
effect that disrupts magic. Using an extraordinary ability is a free
action unless otherwise noted.
Spell-Like: Spell-like abilities are magical and work just like
spells (though they are not spells and so have no verbal, somatic,
material, focus, or XP components). They go away in an antimagic
field and are subject to spell resistance if the spell the ability resembles or duplicates would be subject to spell resistance.
A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be
used. A spell-like ability that can be used at will has no use limit.
Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so while threatened provokes attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a Concentration check to use a spelllike ability defensively and avoid provoking an attack of
opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can be
disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used
to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.
For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster level
defines how difficult it is to dispel their spell-like effects and to
define any level-dependent variables (such as range and duration)
the abilities might have. The creature’s caster level never affects
which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the given
caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character would
need to cast the spell of the same name. If no caster level is specified, the caster level is equal to the creature’s Hit Dice.
The saving throw (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10 + the
level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s
Cha modifier.
Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work differently
when cast by characters of different classes—for example, true seeing. A monster’s spell-like abilities are presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in question is not a
sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric, druid, bard, paladin,
and ranger, in that order.
Supernatural: Supernatural abilities are magical and go away in
an antimagic field but are not subject to spell resistance. Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled. Using a supernatural ability is a
standard action unless noted otherwise. Supernatural abilities
may have a use limit or be usable at will, just like spell-like abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks of
opportunity and never require Concentration checks. Unless otherwise noted, a supernatural ability has an effective caster level
equal to the creature’s Hit Dice.
The saving throw (if any) against a supernatural ability is 10 +
1/2 the creature’s HD + the creature’s ability modifier (usually
Charisma).
Spell Immunity (Ex): A creature with spell immunity avoids
the effects of spells and spell-like abilities that directly affect it.
This works exactly like spell resistance, except that it cannot be
overcome. Sometimes spell immunity is conditional or applies to
only spells of a certain kind or level. Spells that do not allow spell
resistance are not affected by spell immunity.
Spell Resistance (Ex): A creature with spell resistance can
avoid the effects of spells and spell-like abilities that directly affect
it.To determine if a spell or spell-like ability works against a creature with spell resistance, the caster must make a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level). If the result equals or exceeds the creature’s spell resistance, the spell works normally, although the creature is still allowed a saving throw.
Spells: Sometimes a creature can cast arcane or divine spells
just as a member of a spellcasting class can (and can activate magic
items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same spellcasting rules that characters are, except as follows.
A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any
somatic component a spell might require by moving its body. Such
a creature also does need material components for its spells. The
creature can cast the spell by either touching the required component (but not if the component is in another creature’s possession)
or having the required component on its person. Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the Eschew Materials feat to avoid fussing
with noncostly components.
A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class unless
its entry says so, and it does not gain any class abilities. For
example, a creature that casts arcane spells as a sorcerer cannot
acquire a familiar. A creature with access to cleric spells must prepare them in the normal manner and receives domain spells if
noted, but it does not receive domain granted powers unless it has
at least one level in the cleric class.
Summon (Sp): A creature with the summon ability can summon
specific other creatures of its kind much as though casting a
summon monster spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of
success (as specified in the creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a failure,
no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just
been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour.
Most creatures with the ability to summon do not use it lightly,
since it leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save their own lives.
An appropriate spell level is given for each summoning ability
for purposes of Concentration checks and attempts to dispel the
summoned creature. As stated on page 37 of the Dungeon Master’s
Guide, no experience points are awarded for summoned monsters.
Swallow Whole (Ex): If a creature with this special attack begins
its turn with an opponent held in its mouth (see Improved Grab,
page 310), it can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting
to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent
can be up to one size category smaller than the swallowing creature.
Being swallowed has various consequences, depending on the
creature doing the swallowing. A swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while the creature that did the swallowing is
not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light
slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage
required to get free is noted in the creature description), or it can
just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of the interior of a
creature that swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2 its natural
armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the
attacker’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.
Swarm Subtype: A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive,
or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the
characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a
single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier,
a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving
throws as a single creature.
A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying
creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its
reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it
moves into an opponent’s space, which provokes an attack of
opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size,
since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares
occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment,
although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY
316
so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its
component creatures.
A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures
or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A
swarm of Fine creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they
are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many
more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based
on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed
tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey
when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. (A swarm of 15,000 centipedes is ten centipede swarms, each swarm occupying a 10-foot square.) The area
occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the
swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.
Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable
anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm
made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and
piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage.
Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower causes it to break up,
though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability
to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to
a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or
bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.
A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific
number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm
has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half
again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an
area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.
Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of wind spell. For
purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the
swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures
(see Winds, page 95 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). For example, a
swarm of locusts (a swarm of Diminutive creatures) can be blown
away by a severe wind. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of nonlethal
damage to a swarm per spell level (or Hit Dice of the originating
creature, in the case of effects such as an air elemental’s whirlwind). A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal
damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.
Swarm Attack: Creatures with the swarm subtype don’t make
standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to
any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move,
with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss
chance for concealment or cover. A swarm’s statistics block has
“swarm” in the Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack
bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its
Hit Dice, as shown below.
Swarm HD Swarm Base Damage
1–5 1d6
6–10 2d6
11–15 3d6
16–20 4d6
21 or more 5d6
A swarm’s attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm’s description
states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm
attack’s damage to 0, being incorporeal, and other special abilities
usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to damage
from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain, or
other special attacks in addition to normal damage.
Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not
make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However,
they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.
Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a swarm’s
damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated
for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarm’s HD + swarm’s
Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a swarm’s description)
negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within
the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell
level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Concentration check.
Tanar’ri Subtype: Many demons belong to the race of evil outsiders known as the tanar’ri.
Traits: A tanar’ri possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
—Immunity to electricity and poison.
—Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10.
—Summon (Sp): Tanar’ri share the ability to summon others of
their kind (the success chance and type of tanar’ri summoned are
noted in each monster description).
—Telepathy.
Telepathy (Su): A creature with this ability can communicate
telepathically with any other creature within a certain range (specified in the creature’s entry, usually 100 feet) that has a language. It
is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically,
although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than
one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.
Some creatures (such as the pseudodragon) have a limited form
of telepathy, while others (such as the formian queen) have a more
powerful form of the ability.
Trample (Ex): As a full-round action, a creature with this special attack can move up to twice its speed and literally run over any
opponents at least one size category smaller than itself. The creature merely has to move over the opponents in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling creature’s space is subject to the trample attack.
If a target’s space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if the trampling creature moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over only some of a target’s
space, the target can make an attack of opportunity against the
trampling creature at a –4 penalty. A trampling creature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to the last
legal position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a
legal position that’s closer.
A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creature’s slam
damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier). The creature’s descriptive
text gives the exact amount.
Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but
these take a –4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of opportunity,
trampled opponents can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage.
The save DC against a creature’s trample attack is 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + creature’s Str modifier (the exact DC is given in the
creature’s descriptive text). A trampling creature can only deal
trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how
many times its movement takes it over a target creature.
Tremorsense (Ex): A creature with tremorsense is sensitive to
vibrations in the ground and can automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures
moving through water. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text.
Treasure: This entry in a monster description describes how
CHAPTER 7:
GLOSSARY

much wealth a creature owns. (See pages 52–56 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide for details about treasure, particularly Tables 3–5,
through 3–8.) In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home
or lair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend
to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.
Treasure can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures can
have varying amounts of each, as follows.
Standard: Refer to Table 3–5 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and
roll d% once for each type of treasure (Coins, Goods, Items) on the
Level section of the table that corresponds to the creature’s Challenge Rating (for groups of creatures, use the Encounter Level for
the encounter instead).
Some creatures have double, triple, or even quadruple standard
treasure; in these cases, roll for each type of treasure two, three, or
four times.
None: The creature collects no treasure of its own.
Nonstandard: Some creatures have quirks or habits that affect
the types of treasure they collect. These creatures use the same
treasure tables, but with special adjustments.
Fractional Coins: Roll on the Coins column in the section corresponding to the creature’s Challenge Rating, but divide the result
as indicated.
% Goods or Items: The creature has goods or items only some of
the time. Before checking for goods or items, roll d% against the
given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll on the appropriate Goods or Items column (which may still result in no goods
or items).
Double Goods or Items: Roll twice on the appropriate Goods or
Items column.
Parenthetical Notes: Some entries for goods or items include
notes that limit the types of treasure a creature collects.
When a note includes the word “no,” it means the creature does
not collect or cannot keep that thing. If a random roll generates
such a result, treat the result as “none” instead. For example, if a
creature’s “items” entry reads “no flammables,” and a random roll
generates a scroll, the creature instead has no item at all (the scroll
burned up, or the creature left it behind).
When a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of
its way to collect treasure of the indicated type. If an entry for
goods indicates “gems only,” roll on the appropriate Goods column
and treat any “art” result as “gems” instead.
It’s sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of item
appears. For example, if a creature’s items entry reads “nonflammables only,” roll normally on the appropriate Items column. If you
get a flammable item, reroll on the same portion of the table until
you get a nonflammable one. If the table you rolled on contains
only flammable items, back up a step and reroll until you get to a
table that can give you an appropriate item.
Turn Resistance (Ex): A creature with this special quality (usually an undead) is less easily affected by clerics or paladins (see
Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the Player’s Handbook). When
resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add the
indicated number to the creature’s Hit Dice total. For example, a
shadow has 3 Hit Dice and +2 turn resistance. Attempts to turn,
rebuke, command, or bolster treat the shadow as though it had 5
Hit Dice, though it is a 3 HD creature for any other purpose.
Undead Type: Undead are once-living creatures animated by
spiritual or supernatural forces.
Features: An undead creature has the following features.
—12-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).
—Good Will saves.
—Skill points equal to (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, if the undead
creature has an Intelligence score. However, many undead are
mindless and gain no skill points or feats.
Traits: An undead creature possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
—No Constitution score.
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects.
—Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, or
energy drain. Immune to damage to its physical ability scores
(Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), as well as to fatigue and
exhaustion effects.
—Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence
score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such as an inflict
spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing special quality
works regardless of the creature’s Intelligence score.
—Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless
the effect also works on objects or is harmless).
—Uses its Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.
—Not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced
to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.
—Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities.
Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead creatures. These
spells turn undead creatures back into the living creatures they
were before becoming undead.
—Proficient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and
any weapons mentioned in its entry.
—Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or
heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor.
Undead are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any
form of armor.
—Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.
Vermin Type: This type includes insects, arachnids, other
arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates.
Features: Vermin have the following features.
—8-sided Hit Dice.
—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
—Good Fortitude saves.
—Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit
Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, if the vermin
has an Intelligence score. However, most vermin are mindless and
gain no skill points or feats.
Traits: Vermin possess the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature’s entry).
—Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mindaffecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects).
—Darkvision out to 60 feet.
—Proficient with their natural weapons only.
—Proficient with no armor.
—Vermin breathe, eat, and sleep.
Vulnerability to Energy: Some creatures have vulnerability to
a certain kind of energy effect (typically either cold or fire). Such
a creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from
the effect, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the
save is a success or failure.
Water Subtype: This subtype usually is used for elementals
and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Water.
Creatures with the water subtype always have swim speeds and
can move in water without making Swim checks. A water creature
can breathe underwater and usually can breathe air as well.

The organization entries in the Monster Manual
give some indication of what kinds of groupings
various creatures might form. These entries are
intended as examples to get you thinking about
how the creatures live and act from day to day.
When you sit down to create an adventure or
encounter featuring a group of creatures in their
lair, you can use the organization entry (along
with other elements of the creature description) as
a creative springboard.
The sample lair presented here is an outpost used by
a hobgoblin war party. It also embodies some elements
of a hobgoblin tribal lair.
LOCATION AND
PURPOSE OF THE LAIR
This outpost is located in a hilly area of the sort hobgoblins favor (see the Environment section of the Monster Manual’s Hobgoblin entry). The lair serves as a sort
of advanced base for a group of hobgoblins bent on
doing some raiding. Their targets might include
human or elf settlements, passing caravans, or perhaps
even mining camps in the area.
The lair itself lies below ground. Thick vegetation
(trees, tangled bushes, or a combination thereof) covers
the surface above the lair, and the various entrances are
well hidden.
FEATURES
The outpost consists of a series of tunnels and chambers carved out by the hobgoblins’ slaves. It has a single
floor that lies about 15 feet below the surface, though a
few areas are slightly lower than others are. Unless
otherwise stated in the text for a specific area, the outpost’s major features are as follows.
Walls: The walls are made of packed earth mixed
with stones. The Climb DC for such a wall is 20.
Ceilings: The ceilings within the outpost are 8
feet high.
Floors: Floors are made of packed earth and stone.
Their composition is similar to that of the walls, except
that the floors have been smoothed over with clay and
covered with reeds and twigs that tend to crackle
underfoot. Anyone moving along a floor takes a –5
penalty on Move Silently checks.
Doors: The few doors in the outpost are made of
reinforced wood, and all of them have locks unless
otherwise noted. The adept in area 7 and the sergeant
in area 8 have keys to all the doors.
2
D Strong Wooden Door: 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp
20; Break DC 23; Open Lock DC 20.
Light: The hobgoblins rely primarily on their
darkvision to see, and no areas are lit except as noted.
WITHIN THE OUTPOST
The numbered sections that follow are keyed to the
map. A short description of each area follows.
Hobgoblins are highly organized and very disciplined. When invaders enter the outpost, its personnel
don’t just sit in their rooms waiting to be killed.
Instead, they react according to a prearranged plan.
The Development section in each area description
explains what the hobgoblins there have been
instructed to do. They follow their standing orders
unless you decide that circumstances warrant different actions from them.
Vuroosk, the hobgoblin sergeant in area 8, takes
charge whenever trouble arises. The development section in the area 8 description includes the plan that
Vuroosk is most likely to use. If circumstances call for a
different approach, feel free to alter the sergeant’s
actions accordingly.
AREA 1: ENTRANCES (EL 1)
Each of these three areas provides access to the surface
via a vertical shaft about 20 feet long. The top of each
shaft is capped with a trapdoor disguised as a stump, a
rock, or a tuft of bushes. A searcher who has not actually seen another creature using an entrance needs a
successful Search check (DC 20) to find it. The hobgoblins are careful not to use any single entrance so often
as to create a trail or path leading to it, and they usually
double back on their own tracks when entering or leaving the outpost.
These entrances reflect the hobgoblins’ passion for
defense. They usually employ crude wooden ladders
(Climb DC –5) to move between the outpost and the
surface, but the ladders are stowed against the nearby
walls when not in use. The guard on duty places a
ladder in a shaft only when he hears someone open the
trapdoor at the top and speak the correct password for
that day—in Goblin. The ladder is removed and stowed
again immediately after each use. Getting a ladder into
place usually takes about 1 minute. The hobgoblins
have, however, made provisions for a rapid descent (see
the Trap section, below).
The walls of the entrance shafts look just like the
walls in the rest of the outpost. However, the stones in
these walls are exceptionally loose, so the surface tends
to crumble and break away when touched. This feature
gives the shaft a base Climb DC of 30.
The raised ledge near each entrance is about 5 feet
high. It’s a fairly easy matter for a creature of at least
Medium size to scramble up to one of these ledges
(Climb DC 10), but a smaller creature must make a DC
20 Climb check.
Creatures (EL 1/2): A single hobgoblin warrior
always keeps watch at each entrance.
D Hobgoblin Warrior: hp 6; see page 153 in the
Monster Manual.
Tactics: The guard typically remains atop the
raised ledge near the base of the shaft he guards, watching and listening for any activity at the trapdoor above.
When a visitor gives the correct password, the guard
maneuvers a ladder into position. If the correct password is not forthcoming, the guard unlocks the cover
of the pit trap (see below) and shouts out in Common
for the visitor to “stop wasting time and just jump.”
Should an intruder who has not given the correct password seem reluctant to jump, the warrior jumps up and
down atop the latched pit cover and assures the
intruder that all is well, then steps off the cover and
unlatches it.
If an intruder manages to get down the shaft without falling into the pit trap at the bottom, the guard
tries to block off the passage. He stands at the top of the
raised ledge and uses the total defense action until his
comrades from area 2 arrive (see area 2).
The extra hobgoblins take up positions in the
alcoves to either side of the raised ledge. The one in the
middle attacks the intruder, gaining a +1 bonus on his
attack rolls for being on higher ground. Both of the
additional hobgoblins use the aid another action—one
to improve the center warrior’s Armor Class, and the
other to improve his attack rolls.
Trap: A pit with an exceptionally sturdy cover lies
at the bottom of each shaft. These pits can provide a
rude shock for intruders who try to force their way into
the outpost.
a Covered Pit Trap: CR 1; mechanical; location
trigger; automatic reset, DC 15 Reflex save avoids; 10 ft.
deep (1d6, fall); pit spikes (Atk +10 melee, 1 spike for
1d6); Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20). Market
Price: 1,000 gp.
The pit cover is hinged in the middle and can spin
freely when not latched. One side of it is thickly
padded, so that anyone who deliberately jumps down
onto it from the trapdoor above takes only 1d6 points of
nonlethal damage, or no damage at all with a successful
3
Jump or Tumble check (DC 10). Normally, the damage
and the check DC for such a jump would be greater,
even for a landing on a soft surface, but the pit covers
are specifically designed and built to cushion falls.
When the cover is unlatched, anyone jumping or
falling from the shaft takes damage from it as noted
above, but the pit cover also spins and dumps the
victim into the pit below. The pit is 10 feet deep, and
the bottom is lined with spikes. Together, the fall and
the spikes deal 2d6 points of damage. Anyone merely
stepping on the unlatched pit cover can attempt a
Reflex save (DC 15) to avoid falling in.
Development: Any combat here is certain to
attract the attention of additional guards at the nearest
guardpost (area 2). Any prolonged negotiation or other
noise that doesn’t involve a fight eventually draws the
attention of the sentries at the nearest guardpost (see
the Development section of area 2).
The entrance guards tend to stay at their posts no
matter what else happens in the outpost. If called away
by the warriors at area 2 (see the Development section
there), the guard here unlatches the pit cover before
leaving.
AREA 2: GUARDPOSTS (EL 1)
These areas serve as backup guardposts for the
entrances. The guards here have a table, chairs, and a
few provisions, so their duty is somewhat easier than
that of the entrance guards.
Creatures: Two hobgoblin warriors are always on
duty here. Each hour, one of them switches places with
a guard at the nearest entrance. This arrangement helps
keep everyone rested and fairly alert.
D Hobgoblin Warriors (2): hp 6 each; see page
153 in the Monster Manual.
Tactics: These hobgoblins are charged with preventing unauthorized entry to or exit from the outpost.
These guards overhear most activity at the entrance
nearest them, but they ignore anything short of a
pitched battle unless it continues for 1d4+1 rounds. If
they hear fighting at the entrance, however, one goes
to help defend the warrior there, while the second
takes 1 round to dash to area 4, raise the alarm, and
dash back here. Once that task is completed, the
second guard also joins the fight at the entrance.
Noise of combat inside the outpost alerts the guards
here after 1d4+1 rounds. They do not react immediately because martial noises of various kinds occur frequently in the outpost. Off-duty hobgoblins hold sparring matches, gladiatorial fights between slaves and
prisoners from areas 10 and 11 are staged from time to
time, and worship in area 9 can get noisy, too. Once
they decide to investigate, however, one guard goes to
the scene of the disturbance, and the other carries a
warning to area 4, then returns here to wait for her
comrade. If the absent sentry fails to return after 1d4+3
rounds, the sentry here calls the guard at the entrance,
and the two go off to join the fray themselves. The pair
first goes to area 4 or 8 to get orders, but if no one is
present in either area to instruct them, they seek out
the battle themselves.
Should any intruders get past the guard at the
entrance without making a lot of noise, these guards
try to delay them as long as possible, using tactics similar to those described for area 1.
Development: Should a fight develop in any of
the guardposts, the hobgoblins from the rest of the outpost eventually converge there, as noted in the various
Development sections.
AREA 3: TRASH DUMP
The door to this chamber is not locked, and it opens
easily.
The hobgoblins pile all their refuse here. The place
features a great, smelly heap of used bedding and cooking scraps, plus several casks full of night soil. When
this chamber gets full, the hobgoblins force their slaves
to haul the waste to the surface, where they dump it far
from the outpost.
AREA 4: MAIN BARRACKS (EL 3)
The hobgoblins eat, sleep, and relax here. Read or paraphrase the following when the characters enter this area.
Light from two charcoal firepits bathes this long
hall in a feeble, ruddy glow. The air in here smells
strongly of smoke, seared meat, and sweaty
bodies.
Low beds with log frames line the area’s north
and south walls. Along the center of the room are a
couple of tables and perhaps a dozen stools, also
made of logs. Two deeply scarred wooden dummies, roughly humanoid in shape, stand against
the short east wall. Someone has added big,
pointed ears made of leather to both dummies,
which makes them look pretty ridiculous.
At the west end of the north wall is a small,
dark alcove. One wall section near the middle of
the south wall appears to be made of fitted stone,
not packed earth, like the walls in the rest of this
complex. Set in the center of that wall section is a
sturdy wooden door
Six beds stand along the north wall, and nine along the
south. (Some of the hobgoblins are obliged to share
bunks with their comrades.) The beds are very low, and
their mattresses are made from canvas ticks stuffed with
leaves. Each bed has a few personal items (see the Treasure section, below) stored near it or under it. Also under
each bed are a covered bucket for slops, a clay pitcher of
water, and one or two sets of battered eating utensils.
The hobgoblins use the firepits for cooking, and
they usually keep the fires burning around the clock.
The ceiling has a couple of small vents that let out the
worst of the smoke, which is so dispersed by the time it
reaches the surface that it’s unnoticeable. The system
isn’t very efficient, but the hobgoblins are accustomed
to the smoke. A small collection of cooking utensils is
stacked near each pit.
The two wooden dummies serve as targets for
weapon practice. The leather ears have been added to
make the figures look more like elves.
See areas 4A and 4B for details on the dark alcove
and the stone wall section.
Creatures: This chamber is home to twenty-three
hobgoblin warriors, but only six are ever here at once.
Nine are standing guard in areas 1 and 2, and another
eight are out on patrols or raids at any given time.
Three goblin slaves are here at all times here as well,
doing domestic chores for their hobgoblin masters.

Skills and Feats: Craft (woodworking) +1, Hide +7,

Tactics: Three of the six hobgoblins in this chamber are awake, and the other three are asleep. They
sleep in their armor and keep their weapons handy—
either hanging from their bedframes or stashed under
their beds. The sleepers tend to snooze through any
disturbance except other hobgoblins shouting for help.
It takes the sleepers a full-round action to wake up and 4
5
get out of bed, and a move action to pick up their weapons. Once armed, the sleepers tend to use the tactics
described below.
The three hobgoblins that are awake lose no time
responding to an intruder in this area. They form a
battle line, and one of them orders one slave to area 6,
one to area 7, and the third to area 8 (a free action).
Then the warriors hurl javelins at whichever targets
they think they have they best chance of hitting. They
choose foes without cover over foes with cover, and
unarmored targets over armored ones. Against foes
within melee reach, the warriors try to maneuver into
flanking positions if they can. Their general strategy is
to eliminate weaker foes first. If they have difficulty
hurting a foe, they either switch to easier targets or use
the aid another action to improve their attack bonuses.
The slaves obey their orders with alacrity because
they know the price of disobedience only too well. See
the Development sections of areas 6, 7, and 8 for details.
Development: The hobgoblins here react quickly
if one of their comrades brings a warning. They immediately wake their companions and send their slaves off
to areas 6,7, and 8, as described in the Tactics section.
As soon as all six hobgoblins are ready, they march off
to the scene of the action, unless they receive orders to
the contrary (see the Development section of area 8).
Fighting in area 1 or 2 draws the attention of the
hobgoblins here after 1d3 rounds. Once they notice
something amiss, they react as noted above.
Any fighting in this area eventually draws guards
from areas 1 and 2, as noted in the Development sections for those areas. It also brings the sergeant from
area 8 and the adept from area 7, along with a pair of
dire apes from area 6 (see the Development sections in
those areas for details).
Treasure: A small bag or box of valuables is
stowed near each bed in this room. The container
either lies underneath the bed or hangs from the frame.
If the PCs search all the beds, they can collect the following: 300 gp, 600 sp, 12 pieces of hematite (worth 10
gp each), 8 pieces of malachite (worth 10 gp each), 10
moss agates (worth 10 gp each), a set of eight of ivory
dice with gold and amber pips (worth 8 gp each), 2
silver cups (worth 12 gp each, 3 gold armbands (worth
25 gp each), and a serpentine statuette of an erinyes
devil (worth 80 gp).
Area 4a: Storeroom
The walls, ceiling, and floor of this area are all made of
stone. The hobgoblins keep their food and drink here.
Most of their provisions consist of game taken from the
surface, so several dressed carcasses hang from hooks
in the ceiling. A few barrels of hardtack, a crate of dried
fruit, and several casks of ale and wine round out the
food stores.
Area 4b: Well
This area features a stone-lined shaft about 100 feet
deep. Very cold water fills the shaft to a height of 30
feet. A big wooden bucket is attached to a ring on the
west wall with an 80-foot rope. The slaves use this
assembly to draw water from the well.
AREA 5: SMITHY
This alcove contains a crude forge built out of rocks
collected from the surface. A pile of charcoal, a big, flat
stone that serves as an anvil, and two stone troughs full
of dirty water give mute testimony to its purpose.
Hooks on the walls hold a couple of bellows, plus some
hammers and a few sets of tongs.
A barrel next to the forge holds miscellaneous bits
of steel and iron—mostly old horseshoes, nails, and
pieces of chain, but also arrowheads, notched axe
blades, bent daggers, broken swords, and smashed helmets. A successful Search check (DC 15) through all
this junk reveals a tarnished silver holy symbol of Pelor
(taken from a cleric’s shield) with some of its rays bent
or broken off. The symbol is worth 10 gp as is, or 25 gp
if cleaned up and repaired.
The hobgoblin adept from area 7 occasionally plies
his metalworking craft here, but only when the hobgoblins are sure no enemies are nearby to see the
smoke from the forge. An airshaft about 6 inches wide
leads from above the forge directly to the surface.
AREA 6: APE DEN (EL 5)
The south door to this chamber is barred from the
south side, but not locked.
The hobgoblins keep a pair of dire apes in this room.
Read or paraphrase the following when the characters
enter.
The door opens to reveal a dingy chamber that
reeks of excrement and rotted flesh. By the light
of a single touch set in the north wall, two gaunt,
feral apes, both well equipped with claws and
teeth, are visible. In the northeast corner beyond
the apes stands a massive-looking wooden ladder.
Its top is out of sight in a vertical shaft that is
easily wide enough to accommodate the apes.
The apes don’t seem too pleased with the intrusion. They bare their bloodstained teeth and
bellow out inhuman sounds that seem half growl,
half scream.
6
The ladder in the northeast corner leads up about 12
feet to a dead end. Three feet of packed earth separate
the end of the shaft from the surface. The hobgoblins
created this feature to serve as an emergency exit for
the outpost. With about 1 minute of digging, a character working with a shovel or a sword can clear away the
dirt and open a path to the surface.
The torch stuck in the north wall is an everburning
torch, set here to give the apes some light. It can easily
be removed.
Creatures: As noted above, this chamber serves as
the lair of two dire apes.
D Dire Apes (2): hp 35 each; see page 62 in the
Monster Manual.
Tactics: The adept in area 7 has reared and trained
these apes to serve as fighting creatures. They attack
any creature they see, except goblins or hobgoblins. If a
foe should enter through the south door, both apes
move to attack. Should the foe come from the west,
where there’s room for only one ape to fight, the closest
one charges in while the other tries to burst through
the south door and attack the foe through area 7. (The
apes aren’t very smart, but they know the outposts’
layout and they’re eager to fight.)
Development: If the PCs get this far without
alerting the hobgoblins to their presence, the screams
of the apes serve as an effective alarm. If Hoortchuc,
the adept from area 7, is still alive, he is the first to
arrive.
If a general alarm has been raised before the party
gets this far, the hobgoblins in area 4 have already sent
a slave here (and one each to areas 7 and 8). Upon arriving, the goblin goes to the south door and waits for the
adept in area 7 to release the apes. If Hoortchuc does
not appear within 3 rounds, the goblin lifts the bar to
the south door and releases the creatures himself.
Once out of their chamber, the apes first try to go to
area 7 to find the adept, if he is not present. If
Hoortchuc is dead or absent, or if the apes can’t get into
area 7, they go to area 4 and attack the first enemy they
see or scent. If the adept is not on hand to take charge
of the apes, the goblin slave picks up the everburning
torch from the north wall and follows the apes. If the
adept does take over, the goblin follows along but slips
off to area 10 at the first opportunity.
AREA 7: ADEPT’S CHAMBER (EL 4)
This room contains a comfortable bed with an iron
frame, a feather mattress, and pillows. A charcoal brazier provides heat, and a small writing desk in one
corner holds a pile of parchments, pens, an inkwell,
and a small water clock. About half the parchments are
blank; the rest contain notes that form a sort of personal journal (see the Creatures section, below, for
details).
In a niche in the north wall is a pile of humanoid
skulls (mostly human and elf). Set into the wall above
them is a small, double-bitted axe made from a single
piece of silver. An artful combination of black and red
enamel makes the blades appear to be dripping blood.
The axe is the symbol of the deity Maglubiyet, patron
of goblins and hobgoblins. Though useless as a tool or
weapon, it’s worth 75 gp.
Creature: The hobgoblin adept Hoortchuc calls
this chamber home. He spends most of his time here
considering plans for future raids, composing sermons
to deliver to the rest of the outpost, and scribbling in
his journal in Goblin.
The journal features a careful accounting of the
passing days, since Hoortchuc must give a sermon
every eight days. He also fills many pages with theological musings, and these notes form the basis of his sermons. In addition, the adept keeps notes on all the loot
and slaves the warband has collected. His journal indicates that the band has captured far more slaves and
taken considerably more loot than the outpost actually
contains at present. Most of the missing treasure and
slaves have been passed on to the local tribal chieftain.
The hobgoblins have spent the remaining cash and
killed the remaining slaves, either in gladiatorial
matches or as sacrifices to their god, Maglubiyet.
Hoortchuc also handles the feeding and ongoing
training of the apes in area 6. He isn’t too concerned
about their hygiene, which accounts for the stench in
the apes’ den.
D Hoortchuc: Male hobgoblin Expert 2/Adept 2;
CR 4; Medium humanoid (goblinoid); HD 2d6+2 plus
2d6+2; hp 18; Init +1; Spd 30 ft.; AC 11, touch 11, flatfooted 10; Base Atk +2; Grp +1; Atk +1 (1d6–1, quarterstaff) or +3 ranged (1d8/19–20, light crossbow); Full

Combat Casting, Iron Will.
Adept Spells Prepared: (3/2; save DC 12 + spell
level): 0—cure minor wounds, light, mending; 1st—bless,

7
Possessions: Quarterstaff, light crossbow, case of
10 bolts, scroll of dispel magic, scroll of cure critical
wounds, potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of burning
hands (38 charges), wand of cure light wounds (22
charges).
Tactics: If attacked in this chamber, Hoortchuc
flees to area 6, where his apes can help him. He uses his
bless spell as soon as he can, followed by his command
spell, which he aims at the foe that appears most physically imposing. He uses his wand of cure light wounds on
the apes when necessary. Otherwise, he plies his wand
of burning hands and his crossbow whenever suitable
targets present themselves.
Development: Any disturbance here brings the
apes from area 6. Likewise, Hoortchuc goes to help his
apes if they’re attacked in their lair (see area 6).
Hoortchuc remains lost in his own musings and
unaware of activity elsewhere in the outpost until a
messenger (typically one of the goblin slaves from area
4) comes to rouse him. When informed of trouble,
Hoortchuc goes to area 6 and sends the apes to area 4,
then takes down the everburning torch and follows them.
Once the trio reaches area 4, all three attack any enemies they find, using the tactics described in the
entries for areas 4 and 6. If there is no enemy in area 4,
Hoortchuc and the apes either go where the sergeant
sends them or follow the sounds of battle and press the
attack as best they can.
If the alarm is raised, the goblin sent to summon
Hoortchuc to area 4 tags along behind when the adept
takes the apes to fight but slips away to area 10 as soon
as possible. Should the goblin find Hoortchuc absent
or dead, she immediately heads for area 10.
AREA 8: SERGEANT’S CHAMBER (EL 5)
Vuroosk, the sergeant in charge of the outpost, lives
here. His chamber is similar to area 7, except that it has
no water clock or niche with skulls and holy symbol.
A neatly kept ledger on the writing desk details captives and loot the hobgoblins have taken. The sergeant’s notes are nearly identical to those kept by the
adept in area 7, but easier to read. Vuroosk also keeps a
roster of the outpost’s warriors, a pay ledger, and
records of supplies both used and needed. A packet of
reports detailing the exploits of Vuroosk’s troops (all
addressed to the local hobgoblin chieftain, named
Nygraag) lies at the bottom of the stack. All the records
here are written in Goblin.
Creatures: Vuroosk spends most of his time
laying plans for future raids. He accepts suggestions
from the adept and from his troops, incorporating the
best of them into his schemes. He also spends a fair
amount of time keeping records and writing reports for
his chieftain.
D Vuroosk: Male hobgoblin Fighter 2/Ranger 2;
CR 4; Medium humanoid (goblinoid); HD 2d10+2 plus
2d8+2; hp 29; Init +4; Spd 30 ft.; AC 18, touch 14, flatfooted 14; Base Atk +4; Grp +6; Atk +6 melee
(1d6+2/19–20, masterwork short sword) or +9 ranged
1d8+2/[TS]3, masterwork composite longbow [+2 Str
bonus]); Full Atk +6 melee (1d6+2/19–20, masterwork
short sword) and +6 melee (1d6+1/19–20, masterwork
short sword) or +9 ranged 1d8+2/[TS]3, masterwork
composite longbow [+2 Str bonus]); SQ combat style
(two-weapon fighting), favored enemy (elves +2), wild
empathy +2; AL LE; SV Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +1; Str 14,
Dex 18, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10.
Skills and Feats: Climb +7, Hide +6, Jump +7, Spot
+11, Survival +6; Dodge, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot,
Track, Weapon Focus (short sword).
Favored Enemy: Vuroosk has selected elves as a
favored enemy. He gains a +2 bonus on his Bluff,
Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when
using these skills against elves. He gets the same bonus
on weapon damage rolls against elves.
Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, 2 masterwork short swords, masterwork composite longbow (+2
Str bonus), 3 potions of cure light wounds, eyes of the eagle.
Tactics: Vuroosk prefers to fight behind a wall of
his own troops, using his bow to harass enemy spellcasters when possible or to help defeat fighter-types
when necessary. The sergeant is equally skilled in
melee combat. Like the warriors in area 4, Vuroosk
prefers to eliminate weaker opponents first, so as to
strip more powerful foes of their support.
If fighting alone, Vuroosk tries to stay out of melee
range as long as he can. If he can’t avoid melee, he tries
to stand in a doorway or corner, where be can’t be
flanked.
Treasure: Vuroosk keeps a locked strongbox
under his bed. He has the only key.
s Ironbound Strongbox: 2 in. thick; hardness
5; hp 35; Break DC 27; Open Lock DC 25.
Inside the box are a leather bag containing 350 gp, a
leather pouch containing 28 pp, an unlocked wooden
box that holds three strings of pearls (worth 500 gp
each), eight packets of rare spices (worth 25 gp each),
and a cloak of elvenkind. The gold coins represent
Vuroosk’s pay chest; the other items are treasure that
the hobgoblins wrested from their victims.
Development: When foes try to enter the outpost, word of the assault eventually reaches Vuroosk.
The sergeant tries to make a stand in area 4, where there
is space to bring the apes from area 6 into play. He sends
a few warriors off to delay the attackers but holds back
at least half of his troops for the main battle in area 4.
When fighting in area 4, Vuroosk tries to draw the
foe to the east end of the chamber, so that any reinforcements arriving from areas 1 and 2 can come up
behind the foe.
AREA 9: FANE OF MAGLUBIYET
In the center of this chamber is a large firepit (usually
cold). South of the firepit stand two rows of benches
made of split logs, and north of it lies a big chopping
block with a great, black, double-bitted axe embedded in
it. Both axe and block are well spattered with bloodstains.
The block is just a piece of bloodstained wood with
hollows and channels cut in it to facilitate beheadings.
The axe is a masterwork greataxe with a head made of
blackened steel and a handle made of dark wood,
stained black.
AREA 10: SLAVE QUARTERS (EL 1)
The door leading to this room is barred from the outside but is not locked.
Creatures: Seven goblin slaves (see area 4 for statistics) live here in squalid conditions, but only four of
them are here at any given time, and they are asleep
unless the PCs have been very noisy. They don’t really
mind the filth.
Each goblin has a pile of straw and twigs for a bed.
The slaves also have their own cooking pit and utensils,
plus a small cache of supplies.
Tactics: If the PCs enter this chamber, the goblins
promptly hurl themselves at the characters’ feet and
beg them to have mercy on poor, abused slaves. If
attacked, the goblins do their best to evade blows and
escape from the outpost.
Development: Once the alarm is sounded, the
goblin slaves from area 4 carry out their assignments
and then try to make their way here and release their
fellow goblins. If they manage to do so, all the goblins
try to slip away from the outpost, either through one
the entrances or via the emergency exit in area 6.
If the PCs try to question the goblins here, the level
of cooperation they get depends on what has happened
to the hobgoblins in the outpost thus far. If the goblins
believe (or know) that their hobgoblin masters have
been defeated, they fawn on the PCs and truthfully
answer any questions put to them. The goblins know
the outpost quite well, but if the PCs have already
defeated the hobgoblins, such information does them
little good. The goblins know nothing about the hobgoblins’ plans for the surrounding area. They do know
that the two chief hobgoblins, Vuroosk and Hoortchuc,
answer to some “hobgoblin bigwig” in the area, but
they don’t know who. They’ve never heard of Nygraag
(see the area 8 entry), and they have no idea where such
a person might be found.
The goblins are much less helpful if they believe the
PCs have not defeated the hobgoblins in the outpost.
They pretend to be utterly cowed, and they usually
reply to questions by cringing and whining.
In any case, the goblins bide their time and try to
escape from the PCs (and the hobgoblins) at the first
opportunity.
AREA 11: PRISON
This long, narrow chamber features two rows of covered pits that the hobgoblins use as prison cells. Each
pit is 20 feet deep, and its walls are similar to those at
the entrances (Climb DC 20). The pit covers are padlocked from the top; otherwise, they are just like the
doors in the rest of the outpost.
Four 1st-level elf warriors are presently incarcerated
here. (Use the statistics from page 102 in the Monster
Manual, except that these elves have no equipment and
2 hit points each.) They are starved nearly to death and
in no shape to fight, but they are willing to give it a try
if the PCs insist.
If the PCs release these captives, the local elf lord
offers them each a reward of 75 gp.

Monster Manual v.3.5 Errata
Errata Rule: Primary Sources
When you find a disagreement between two D&D rules
sources, unless an official errata file says otherwise, the
primary source is correct. One example of a
primary/secondary source is text taking precedence over
a table entry. An individual spell description takes
precedence when the short description in the beginning
of the spells chapter disagrees. A monster’s statistics
block supersedes the descriptive text.
Another example of primary vs. secondary sources
involves book and topic precedence. The Player’s
Handbook, for example, gives all the rules for playing
the game, for PC races, and the base class descriptions.
If you find something on one of those topics from the
Dungeon Master’s Guide or the Monster Manual that
disagrees with the Player’s Handbook, you should
assume the Player’s Handbook is the primary source.
The Dungeon Master’s Guide is the primary source for
topics such as magic item descriptions, special material
construction rules, and so on. The Monster Manual is
the primary source for monster descriptions, templates,
and supernatural, extraordinary, and spell-like abilities.
Note: The most recent updates are shaded like this.
General Changes
These changes are global and apply to an assortment of
creatures.
Damage Reduction
Damage Reduction is either extraordinary (Ex) or
supernatural (Su). Use the following guidelines if it is
not specified.
• DR X/slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning
should be (Ex)
• DR X/adamantine should be (Ex)
• DR X/-- should be (Ex)
• DR X/silver or cold iron should be (Su)
• DR X/magic should be (Su)
• DR X/chaotic, lawful, holy, or unholy should
be (Su)
Improved Natural Attack Feat
You can take this feat multiple times, but each time it
applies to a different natural attack.
Rend
Sometimes two values are listed for rend: one on the
special attacks line and one in the paragraph describing
rend. The correct value is listed on the special attacks
line.
Weapon Finesse Feat
Some creatures that have this feat lack the +1 base
attack bonus prerequisite. Since bonus feats do not
require the creature to fulfill any feat prerequisites (see
page 301 in the Monster Manual), make the Weapon
Finesse feat a bonus feat and add an additional feat (see
the table below).
Alternate Form (Page 305)

The engulf ability needs additional clarification.
Replace it with the following information.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gibbering
mouther must hit a Medium or smaller foe with a bite
attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
Swallow Whole (Ex): The gibbering mouther can
attempt to swallow a grappled opponent of Medium or
smaller size by making a successful grapple check. (The
gibbering mouther doesn’t actually “swallow” the
opponent—it engulfs it within its amorphous form—but
the effect is essentially the same.) Once inside, the
gibbering mouther can use its blood drain ability. A
swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 5
points of damage to the gibbering mouther (same AC).
The gibbering mouther’s body can hold 1 Medium, 2
Small, 8 Tiny, 32 Diminutive, or 128 Fine creatures.
Blood Drain (Ex): A swallowed opponent
automatically takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage
each round.
