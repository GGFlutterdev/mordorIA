# Welcome to the Far North

North of the Spine of the World and west of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.

Each night before midnight, Auril takes to the sky on the back of a white roc and weaves her spell, which manifests as a shimmering curtain of lightÃ¢ÂÂa beautiful aurora that illuminates the night sky and fades before dawn. This powerful magic prevents the next day's sun from rising above the horizon, turning midday into twilight and trapping Icewind Dale in winter's dark embrace, with no sunlight or warmth to melt the snow and ice. Each casting of the spell leaves the Frostmaiden weakened, with just enough divine power left to barricade the mountain pass with blizzards and churn the Sea of Moving Ice with blistering winds. Such measures discourage travelers from approaching or leaving Icewind Dale, further isolating the region. Icewind Dale has thus been trapped in a different reality from the rest of the world, for though the sun never rises over the dale, it continues to rise everywhere else.

The people of Icewind Dale know Auril's wrath when they feel it, and they have a name for the unending winter she has inflicted on them. They call it the Everlasting Rime. No one understands why the Frostmaiden has imposed her will in this way or why the other gods refuse to challenge her. This prolonged winter, which has gone on for more than two years, threatens to doom not just the flickering lights of civilization known as Ten-Towns but also the indigenous flora and fauna that need sunlight and the change of seasons to survive.

Not all creatures are discouraged by what has transpired north of the Spine of the World. The long nights and sunless days are a blessing to **Xardorok Sunblight**, a duergar who longs to carve out a domain for himself on the surface and enslave the people of Ten-Towns in the process. Already, he has taken advantage of Auril's magic and raised a fortress amid the dark shadows of the mountains. From here, his underlings strike out across the tundra in search of chardalynÃ¢ÂÂa crystalline substance known to exist only in Icewind Dale. Once he gathers enough of it, Xardorok plans to construct a chardalyn dragon and unleash it upon Ten-Towns.

Despite Auril's blizzards and other deterrents, visitors still come and go. Among the recent arrivals are four wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, a powerful society of spellcasters based in Luskan. They've come chasing rumors of a lost city buried under the Reghed GlacierÃ¢ÂÂa fragment of the long-gone Empire of Netheril, whose wizards wielded magic that terrified the gods. Netherese magic has a way of attracting power-hungry wizards, as members of the Arcane Brotherhood often are. The cities of Netheril floated among the clouds, making them almost impervious to assault for centuries. Then, nearly two thousand years ago, this floating city crashed during the fall of the empire, and no one has found or explored it since. It is, arguably, Icewind Dale's greatest secretÃ¢ÂÂa necropolis of Netherese wizards and the magic they left behind. What survived the crash is anyone's guess, but we're about to find out!

## About This Book

*Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden* is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure optimized for four to six characters. The player characters are the heroes of the story; this book describes the villains and monsters the heroes must overcome and the locations they must explore to bring the adventure to a successful conclusion.

This book presents Icewind Dale as a self-contained campaign setting in which you can base adventures of your own. All pertinent details about the setting are covered here, with room left to add new locations and villains of your own design.

> ##### Tendays and Dalereckoning
>
>In the Forgotten Realms setting, a week is ten days long and is referred to as a tenday. There are three tendays per month and twelve months in a year. For more information on the calendar of the Forgotten Realms, see "*The Calendar of Harptos*" sidebar in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.
>
>Dalereckoning (DR) is the most common year measurement. This adventure is assumed to take place in the winter of 1489 DR or later. The exact date is not important. The happenings in this book occur more than a century after the events chronicled in R.A. Salvatore's novel *The Crystal Shard*, which introduced the drow hero Drizzt Do'Urden to the hardy folk of Icewind Dale.

## Adventure Summary

A duergar despot forging a dragon out of chardalyn. A lost city of magic entombed in a glacier. A frozen wilderness trapped in Auril's grip. These three plot elements, woven together, form this adventure.

### Duergar Despot

The Reghed nomads who stalk the tundra and the Ten-Towners who keep civilization alive are so concerned with day-to-day survival that they typically pay little heed to the evil forces gathering on the fringes of Icewind Dale. Adventurers are much better equipped to deal with such threats, particularly in the dead of winter.

One recent arrival in the area is **Xardorok Sunblight**, a duergar warlock formerly of the Underdark. His patron, Deep Duerra, has urged Xardorok to fulfill his destiny and become the first duergar to rule a kingdom on the surface. Icewind Dale is cold, dark, and heartlessly cruelÃ¢ÂÂthe perfect realm for Xardorok to claim as despot. Unbeknownst to Xardorok, however, it is not Deep Duerra guiding his actions but the archdevil Asmodeus in the guise of Deep Duerra. In Xardorok, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found an eager and petty tyrant.

To achieve his goal, Xardorok is scouring the land for chardalyn, which he is forging into a dragon that he will send to destroy Ten-Towns. His sons, Durth and Nildar, lead teams of duergar on quests to retrieve more of this dark-colored crystal for their grasping, despotic father.

### Netherese Necropolis

The wizards of bygone Netheril wielded magic that could reshape the world. They used such magic to raise their cities into the sky. The city of Ythryn was one such wonder. It crashed long ago but still exists, buried under the Reghed Glacier on the eastern edge of Icewind Dale.

This frozen necropolis holds the remnants of some of the most powerful spellcasters in the history of the Realms, including a Netherese demilich. It also contains a *mythallar* (described in *appendix D*), a magic item that can raise an entire city into the air and alter the weather in a fifty-mile radius. The characters can use this device to counteract Auril's spell and free Icewind Dale from her Everlasting Rime.

> ##### Chardalyn
>
>More than a hundred years prior to this adventure, a wizard named Akar Kessel found an artifact suffused with demonic magic called *Crenshinibon* (better known as the *Crystal Shard*) and used it to erect a great black tower in Icewind Dale. When this tower was destroyed, the magic used to create it fused with the surrounding ice to form what is now known as chardalyn: a nonmagical, crystalline substance as strong as metal, though considerably easier to work with than steel. In the years since, more deposits of chardalyn have been found across Icewind Dale. Like the *Crystal Shard*, these deposits tend to be suffused with demonic magic. Prolonged contact with chardalyn that has become suffused with demonic magic can warp a creature's mind, causing madness that usually fades away once the contact is broken.
>
>Chardalyn is cold to the touch and readily accepts magical enchantment, making it an ideal substance for wands, staffs, and other magic items. A chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Upper Planes is considered a consecrated object, while a chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Lower Planes is considered a desecrated object; both can be identified as such using a *detect evil and good* spell or similar magic.
>
>Long before Akar Kessel left his mark on Icewind Dale, Netherese wizards created their own chardalyn. Many items made from this dark-colored crystal can be found in the ruins of ancient Netherese enclaves.
>

Four members of the Arcane Brotherhood (a cabal of wizards who act like Wild West gunslingers) have come to Icewind Dale in search of the lost Netherese enclave, hoping to unearth its secrets. Whether the characters choose to aid or oppose these wizards is up to them, but one thing is certain: the Arcane Brotherhood won't let a band of adventurers stand between them and the magic that waits to be found in the doomed, sepulchral ruin.

### Auril's Everlasting Rime

Auril's decision to live among mortals is explained in  *appendix C*. What the characters discover in the course of the adventure is that she's unhappy and craves isolation. Her nightly quest to hold the sun at bay stems from a need to preserve the beauty of things by freezing them. There is no way to reason with a being so bereft of compassion as Auril, but in her weakened state, she can be defeated or forced to reckon with her cruel indifference toward life.

Anyone who hopes to reach the Netherese city buried in the ice must first visit Auril's island and obtain *The Codicil of White*, a book compiled by the Frostmaiden's most ardent followers. The tome contains a magical incantation written as a poem. This poem has the power to crack the Reghed Glacier, opening a path from the surface to the buried Netherese city of Ythryn.

### Other Quests

Chapters 1 and 2 are structured around quests, some of which touch on the major story arcs of the adventure while others merely show off other cool aspects of the setting.

In chapter 1, the adventurers undertake quests that lead them from one Ten-Towns settlement to another. Each town has a problem, and the adventurers get rewards for helping.

In chapter 2, rumors spur the adventurers to leave the cold comfort of Ten-Towns and explore the fringes of Icewind Dale, where dangers dwell.

## Running the Adventure

To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks (*Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*).

>>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>>

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in this adventure. The rest can be found in *appendix C*.

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, you better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." If the stat block appears in appendix C of this adventure, the text tells you so; otherwise, you can find the stat block in the *Monster Manual*.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text direct you to an item's description in *appendix D*.

### Using the Maps

This book contains a number of interior maps and a fold-out, double-sided poster map. These elements are further described below.

#### Interior Maps

Maps that appear in this book are for the DM's eyes only. As the characters explore locations on a given map, you can redraw portions of the map on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or other surface to help your players visualize locations that might have unusual shapes or features. Your hand-drawn maps need not be faithful to the originals, and you can alter a map's features as you see fit. Nor do your maps need to be painstakingly rendered. You can omit details that are not readily visible (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters are able to detect and interact with them.

***Slopes and Staircases.*** On all interior maps, an arrow on a slope or staircase always points in the ascending direction.

#### Poster Map

The double-sided poster map is meant to be shared with the players. One side of the poster map shows Icewind Dale, including Ten-Towns and other sites and features in the region that are common knowledge. The reverse side has player-friendly maps of the ten settlements that comprise Ten-Towns, with prominent locations called out in each town for the players' benefit.

### The Forgotten Realms

The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. In the Realms, knights dare to seek out the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, looking for glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics wield mace and spell in the service of their gods, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Bards sing of kings, queens, tyrants, and heroes who died long ago.

On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales that take them to strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can carry even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are among the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.

Icewind Dale, featured in this adventure, is located in a region called the Far North, which is dominated by the Spine of the World, a range of skyscraping, snow-covered peaks. These extend toward the Sword Coast, which forms the western edge of the great continent of FaerÃÂ»n and stretches southward for thousands of miles. Ships and roads lead southbound travelers to a number of bustling ports along the Sword Coast, including the following strongholds of civilization:

- Luskan, the City of Sails, is home to pirates as well as the Hosttower of the Arcane (headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood, which is described in appendix C).
- Neverwinter, the City of Skilled Hands, is slowly being rebuilt after it was nearly destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow.
- Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, is a seaside metropolis where people from all walks of life gather behind high walls.

### Adventure Flow

The accompanying adventure flowchart visualizes the narrative flow of the adventure, which includes chapters that focus on places of interest (chapters 1 and 2) and chapters that focus on plot (chapters 3 through 7).

*Chapter 1* introduces quests that prompt the characters to explore Ten-Towns, with an additional quest waiting for them in each town they visit. These quests take no more than one or two game sessions each to complete.

*Chapter 2* describes several interesting locations on the fringes of Icewind Dale, including some future threats to Ten-Towns. The characters are drawn to these locations by rumors or quests. These sites are ancillary to the main story but help bring the harsh land of Icewind Dale to life.

The adventure kicks off in earnest with *chapter 3*, as the characters try to beard **Xardorok Sunblight** in his lair. Chapter 3 describes the duergar's fortress. Unfortunately, the characters arrive too late to stop him from unleashing a dragon made of chardalyn. The characters face a difficult choice: continue storming Xardorok's stronghold or return to Ten-Towns to fight the dragon.

The battle with Xardorok's dragon forms the crux of *chapter 4*. Since the dragon is a mobile threat, the characters might have to face it more than once as it ravages one settlement after another. The Ten-Towners have no hope of defeating the dragon on their own, so here's a chance for the characters to become true heroes of Icewind Dale. As they battle the dragon, the characters are aided by a necromancer named **Vellynne Harpell**, who helps steer them toward the discovery of a lost Netherese enclave entombed in the Reghed Glacier.

In *chapter 5*, Vellynne asks the characters to accompany her to Auril's island in the Sea of Moving Ice to recover two items: an orb stolen by a rival and a book titled *The Codicil of White*. The orb has useful magical properties, while the book contains a magical poem that can create a passage through the Reghed Glacier.

*Chapter 6* describes the Caves of Hunger, a network of ice tunnels and caves within the Reghed Glacier itself. The characters must navigate these treacherous passageways to reach the frozen Netherese city, which is described in *chapter 7*. The party's exploration is interrupted by an albino tiefling villain who wants all the city's magical secrets for herself.

### Dissecting the Adventure

You can dissect this adventure and use pieces of it rather than the whole thing. Nothing in this adventure is too sacred to tamper with and repurpose to serve your own needs.

Most of the locations described in this book can be used as stand-alone adventure sites. With a little effort and a few name changes, you can take these adventure locations out of Icewind Dale and transplant them into other campaign worlds, including your own.

Take the duergar fortress in *chapter 3*, for example. You could set the fortress in the Yatil Mountains of Oerth, the Ironroot Mountains of Khorvaire, the Flotket Alps of Wildemount, or some other mountain range while preserving the plot elements. You can also strip out the story about an evil duergar building a dragon construct and have the duergar doing something else instead. Alternatively, you could jettison everything but the map of the fortress, populating it with new creatures that better suit your campaign. Sometimes a good map is all a DM needs!

### Running NPC Party Members

Nonplayer characters (NPCs) are normally controlled by the DM. However, there are times in this adventure when a friendly NPC might join the party for one or more game sessions. If roleplaying that NPC becomes a burden to you, see if one of your players is willing to run the NPC as a secondary character.

If a player agrees to take control of a friendly NPC, provide that player with a copy of the NPC's stat block, along with any roleplaying notes you deem important, and warn the player that you might retake custody of the NPC at some future point. As the adventure progresses, it might become apparent that the player is unable to manage the NPC effectively, or you might need more influence over the NPC's actions and behavior. Either scenario justifies you retaking control of the NPC.

> ##### Horror in the Far North
>
>Parts of this adventure play out like scenes in a horror movie. As the DM, you need to handle the horror responsibly. Although the events of the adventure should make characters feel stressed and anxious, your players should be relaxed and having fun. Before running the adventure, have a candid out-of-game conversation with your players about hard and soft limits on what topics can be broached in-game. Your players might have phobias and triggers you might not unaware of. Any topic or theme that makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care. Be ready to move away from such topics and themes quickly, however.

### Wilderness Survival

The following rules come into play as the characters explore Ten-Towns and embark on adventures to the icy, windy, hellishly cold reaches of Icewind Dale.

#### Avalanches

See the avalanche entry.

#### Blizzards

See the blizzard entry.

![The yeti of Icewind Dale like to stalk their prey in raging blizzards](img/adventure/IDRotF/004-00-004.yeti-splash.webp)

#### Extreme Cold

Rules for extreme cold appear in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* but are repeated here for your convenience.

A creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather clothing (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates, such as **reindeer** and snowy owlbears.

***Temperatures.*** During Auril's everlasting winter, the average temperature in Icewind Dale is Ã¢ÂÂ49 degrees Fahrenheit (Ã¢ÂÂ45 degrees Celsius). Wind chill can lower these temperatures by as much as 80 degrees.

#### Fishing for Knucklehead Trout

To fish for knucklehead trout on the lakes of Icewind Dale, a character needs fishing tackle and a rowboat. The former costs 4 gp (per the *Player's Handbook*), while the latter can be bought for 50 gp or rented for 2 gp per day. A character can fish on the ice instead of a boat, in which case a saw or similar tool is needed to cut a fishing hole through the ice.

At the end of each hour spent fishing on the lake, the character must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. If the check succeeds, the character hooks a **knucklehead trout** (see *appendix C*) and must make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the fish's Strength check to pull it out of the water. The trout has advantage on its check. If the character fails the check, the trout escapes. A character who fails the check by 5 or more must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled into the frigid water (see "Frigid Water" below). A character who is pulled out of the water is dripping wet and continues to suffer the effects of the frigid water until the wet clothes are taken off and replaced with dry ones.

#### Frigid Water

Rules for frigid water appear in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* but are repeated here for your convenience.

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.

#### Illumination

So long as the Everlasting Rime lasts, natural light in Icewind Dale is never brighter than dim. In normal (non-blizzard) conditions, twilight extends from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Icewind Dale is otherwise dark until Auril's aurora or the full moon appears in the night sky.

#### Overland Travel

The fastest way to travel across the tundra is by dogsled (see "Getting Around Ten-Towns"). But dogs are expensive and require food, water, and shelter. Unless they have more equipment than they can carry, adventurers are better off traveling on foot.

The speed that characters can travel across Icewind Dale's rough, snowy tundra is given in the Overland Travel table. Travel is less time-consuming on the snowy roads and trails that connect the settlements of Ten-Towns, as discussed in *chapter 1*.

##### Overland Travel
| Method of Travel           | Distance per Hour |
|----------------------------|:-----------------:|
| Dogsled                    |       1 mile      |
| On foot, with snowshoes    |      1/2 mile     |
| On foot, without snowshoes |      1/4 mile     |

#### Mountain Travel

Navigating the Spine of the World or the slopes of Kelvin's Cairn is particularly arduous because of the unforgiving mountain terrain. At the end of each hour, the character or NPC leading the expedition must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a successful check, the hour's journey was not hindered by weather or terrain. On a failed check, the party comes to an impasse and must backtrack, which costs an extra hour of travel. If the check fails by 5 or more, the party is caught in an avalanche as it backtracks. The avalanche starts 2d6 ÃÂ 100 feet above the characters (see "Avalanches").

The Mountain Travel table shows how fast the characters can move through the mountains on foot or by dogsled. Even in the best of cases, a journey in the mountains takes twice as long as one of the same distance across the tundra.

##### Mountain Travel
| Method of Travel           | Distance per Hour |
|----------------------------|:-----------------:|
| Dogsled                    |      1/2 mile     |
| On foot, with snowshoes    |      1/4 mile     |
| On foot, without snowshoes |      1/8 mile     |

### Pronunciation Guide

The Pronunciations table on the facing page shows how to pronounce many of the non-English names that appear in this adventure.

## Character Creation

Before starting the adventure, consider spending your first game session helping your players create characters. Were the characters born and raised in Icewind Dale, or do they hail from distant lands? How long have they known each other? What secrets are they hiding? The following sections can help you answer these questions.

### Character Backgrounds

The *Player's Handbook* contains character backgrounds that are well suited for this adventure. If your players are having trouble fleshing out their characters' backgrounds with details about Icewind Dale, share the suggestions from the Character Hooks Tied to Backgrounds table with them.

##### Character Hooks Tied to Backgrounds
| Background    | Character Hook                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Acolyte       | Auril the Frostmaiden, the god of winter's fury, has cast an evil spell over Icewind Dale. You can bring hope and faith to the people of Ten-Towns or, even better, free them from winter's cold embrace in the name of your god.                                                                                                                    |
| Charlatan     | Your cons and deceptions nearly got the better of you. You needed to disappear for a while, and Icewind Dale was the perfect place to do so. Nothing could prepare you for the cold and the dark desolation, but at least there's money to be made.                                                                                                  |
| Criminal      | You are wanted for crimes in the cities of Luskan and Mirabar, but no one will think to look for you in Ten-Towns, the cold heart of Icewind Dale. Thankfully, nobody in Ten-Towns cares who you areÃ¢ÂÂor what you've done.                                                                                                                            |
| Entertainer   | You came to Icewind Dale three years ago seeking inspiration for a new song or poem, drawn by tales of the land's harsh beauty and the legendary exploits of Drizzt Do'Urden. Since then, Auril the Frostmaiden has cast an evil spell over the dale, preventing you from returning home.                                                            |
| Folk Hero     | Your name is synonymous with heroism throughout Ten-Towns. Did you save a fisher who fell into the ice, scare away a yeti armed with only a fishing pole and a basket, or beat a drunk goliath at arm wrestling?                                                                                                                                     |
| Guild Artisan | You came to Icewind Dale to start a business. Your shop was doing well until Auril the Frostmaiden cast her evil spell to banish the sun. Now, businesses throughout Ten-Towns are suffering, yours included. To avoid hardship, you might need to supplement your income.                                                                           |
| Hermit        | You've never felt at ease in civilized society, and there's no place farther from the trappings of civilization than Icewind Dale. This is a land without pretense, and the people of Ten-Towns pay you little mind. To them, you're just another silly old fool.                                                                                    |
| Noble         | Your wealthy grandfather or grandmother sent you to Icewind Dale to learn a hard lesson. Perhaps the cruel indifference of this frozen land will prepare you for the cruel indifference of Waterdeep's politics.                                                                                                                                     |
| Outlander     | You're a child of the icy wilderness, born and raised in one of the Reghed tribes. Imagine, after following herds of migrating **reindeer** your whole life, getting a taste of what life in Ten-Towns has to offer.                                                                                                                                 |
| Sage          | You came to Icewind Dale in search of ruins and artifacts left behind by the giants who ruled the ancient empire of Ostoria. To find even one Ostorian relic would fulfill a lifelong dream and make your rivals back home green with envy.                                                                                                          |
| Sailor        | You've sailed ships up and down the Sword Coast, but a shipwreck made you reevaluate your life choices. Two years ago, you headed north, bought a house and a fishing boat in Ten-Towns, and became a fisher. You were told that the summers here are beautiful, but you have yet to see one.                                                        |
| Soldier       | You are a soldier of Ten-Towns, trained to fight orcs and other threats lurking in the Spine of the World mountains. Auril the Frostmaiden has cast an evil spell over Icewind Dale, and you struggle to see how your soldier's training can save this land from so terrible a doom. Still, you are not about to give up on the people of Ten-Towns. |
| Urchin        | Because you grew up in Ten-Towns, your familiarity with the residents makes you useful to Harper spies and Zhentarim bounty hunters who are looking for criminals and other ne'er-do-wells hiding in your midst. Ratting out these newcomers keeps coin in your pockets.                                                                             |

### Goliath Player Characters

All the character races presented in the *Player's Handbook* are well suited for this adventure, as are goliathsÃ¢ÂÂtall, strong folk who live in the mountains. Appendix C includes a description of goliaths and their traits, if you want to allow them in your game.

### Starting Equipment

All characters begin the adventure with a free set of cold weather clothing in addition to the starting equipment they receive from their class and background choices. See "Winter Survival Gear", for more information about cold weather clothing.

#### Trinkets

*Appendix A* provides a table of trinkets appropriate for characters who start their adventuring careers in Icewind Dale. A player whose character has a trinket can roll on this table instead of the Trinkets table in the *Player's Handbook*.

### Character Secrets

*Appendix B* contains secrets that you can photocopy, cut out, and share with players in your home game. While the players are creating their characters, decide whether you want each party member to have a secret or not. The secrets are designed to foment mistrust among party members, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia that is appropriate for the setting.

Determine each character's secret by having that character's player draw a random card from the deck. If a player doesn't like the secret they've drawn, or if the secret is a bad fit for the character, let the player discard the first draw and pick another card. Each character gets one secret to start with. Some of the secrets are benign, others not so much.

If you're running the adventure for a group that loves the idea of characters who have secrets, you can allow each player to draw twice instead of once, creating a party with a disturbing number of skeletons in their closets. If you want to make it possible for more than one character to have the same secret, replace each card in the deck before the next player draws.

Some players will guard their characters' secrets for the entire campaign, never sharing them. Other players will wait for the perfect occasion to reveal their characters' secrets. Don't be surprised if a player decides to reveal their character's secret right away.

#### Using Secrets

The following suggestions are offered to help you make the most out of the secrets in appendix B.

***Alagondar Scion.*** At some point, Lord Dagult Neverember might send a lone **assassin**Ã¢ÂÂa nameless, middle-aged woman with a shaved head and a hook for a right handÃ¢ÂÂto kill the character who has this secret.

***Doppelganger.*** This character can imitate specific NPCs and even other player characters. If this character's secret becomes widely known, the people of Ten-Towns will almost certainly try to kill or drive away the character out of fear.

***Drizzt Fan.*** This harmless secret comes with no strings attached and is a nod to R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt novels, which were among the first works to bring Icewind Dale to life.

***Elusive Paramour.*** This secret is another nod to the Drizzt novels, setting up a situation like the one faced by Regis the halfling. At a time of your choosing, you can have the disgruntled pasha's assassin, an **invisible stalker**, show up to menace the character.

***Escaped Prisoner.*** The character with this secret knows the location of the crashed nautiloid in chapter 2 and can lead the party to it. The trauma of being held captive by the illithids prevents the character from remembering events prior to the crash. A *greater restoration* spell removes this trauma, allowing the character to remember details about the illithids as well as the other prisoners aboard the nautiloid when it crashed (a bulette and two carrion crawlers).

***Littlest Yeti.*** If the party happens upon one or more yetis in the course of the adventure, this secret might reveal itself. You can also rule that yeti tykes (see *appendix C*) are friendly toward this character by default.

***Midwinter Child.*** This is one of the more useful secrets, since the character possessing it is immune to the effects of extreme cold. Also, the player might decide that their character is sympathetic toward Auril because of the gift she has bestowed. If the party succeeds in killing Auril, the benefits of this secret are lost.

***Old Flame.*** This secret comes to light when the player chooses the character's secret lover. Since the onus falls on the player to choose this NPC, the lover can change each time you run this adventure with a different group of characters. This secret can also be used to turn an NPC foe into a potential ally, at your discretion.

***Orc Stone.*** The spirit summoned by the stone belongs to a fierce **orc war chief** named Vokarr the Eyebiter, who was killed by dwarves. This spirit looks like a living, breathing orc. It speaks Common and Orc.

***Owlbear Whisperer.*** If the character uses this secret to change an owlbear's attitude to friendly, the owlbear can become the character's companion and protector, and you can run the owlbear as an NPC.

***Pirate Cannibal.*** The character with this secret knows the location of the Dark Duchess in chapter 2 and can lead the party to it. The character would also know the ship's layout.

***Reghed Heir.*** More information about Queen **Bjornhild Solvigsdottir** and the Tiger Tribe can be found in appendix C. Bjornhild would hardly recognize her discarded offspring, but any character who presents themselves as such will be attacked at once. Bjornhild has no love for her would-be heir, seeing that character only as a rival and a sacrifice to Auril.

***Reincarnation.*** Allow the player to flesh out the details of the character's life prior to being reincarnated, and try to imagine how that back story might tie into some part of the adventure. Some of the races listed in the *reincarnate* spell's table go by different names in the Realms, as noted in the Forgotten Realms Races table. If the player wants to randomly determine the character's cause of death, let them roll on the How I Died table.

|:-----:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1Ã¢ÂÂ3  | I was killed in an avalanche.                                                                                                                                                           |
|  4Ã¢ÂÂ5  | I was murdered by goblins in the mountains after they ambushed my caravan.                                                                                                              |
|  6Ã¢ÂÂ8  | I got mauled to death by a yeti.                                                                                                                                                        |
|  9Ã¢ÂÂ10 | A white dragon attacked my caravan, and I was slain by its freezing breath weapon.                                                                                                      |
| 11Ã¢ÂÂ13 | I was pulled into a freezing lake by a knucklehead trout and drowned before I could be rescued.                                                                                         |
| 14Ã¢ÂÂ16 | A lottery was recently held in Targos to see who would be sacrificed to the Frostmaiden. I was the unlucky one. I died of exposure after being stripped down and cast into a snowstorm. |
| 17Ã¢ÂÂ18 | I was killed in Ten-Towns by a lookalikeÃ¢ÂÂa doppelganger, I presume.                                                                                                                     |
| 19Ã¢ÂÂ20 | I was killed by a white moose outside Ten-Towns.                                                                                                                                        |

***Ring Hunter.*** You might decide that the lost ring sought by this character is lodged inside Ol' Bitey (see "Ol' Bitey"). Otherwise, the character can try to fish it out of Maer Dualdon (see Fishing for Knucklehead Trout). Each time a party member cuts open a trout pulled from this lake, there's a 1 percent chance that the fish has the signet ring lodged inside it.

***Runaway Author.*** Worshipers of Asmodeus send three **bearded devils** (whose fiendish features are cloaked by cold weather clothing) to kill the character who has this secret. If the characters visit Caer-Dineval, the Knights of the Black Sword (see "Knights of the Black Sword"), as followers of Levistus rather than Asmodeus, might warn the characters that an attack on one of them is imminent and even offer sanctuary in Caer-Dineval's keep.

***Slaad Host.*** The exact timing of the slaad tadpole's birth is deliberately left vague, although there are a few places in the adventure where the text suggests that the emergence might occur then and there. See the slaadi entry in the *Monster Manual* for more information about red slaad eggs and slaad tadpoles. Any magic that can cure a disease can end this threat, provided the cure is administered before the **slaad tadpole** bursts from the character's chest.

***Spy.*** Harpers assigned to Icewind Dale can't rely on much support from the organization, so they are expected to look after themselves. Beldora, the character's Harper contact in Bryn Shander, is a chaotic good human **spy** who can help steer the adventure by sharing rumors and providing helpful advice.

# Chapter 1: Ten-Towns

Like the famous drow Drizzt Do'Urden, many people who come to Ten-Towns are outcasts, fugitives, or pariahs in search of a place where they can be tolerated, if not accepted. Some came here determined to make their fortunes. Others come for the solitude, or to escape notice and stay out of the reach of the law of the southern cities. Today, four hundred years after the formation of Ten-Towns, most folk are here because they were born here, grew up here, and expect to die here. They're fishers, loggers, miners, hunters, trappers, furriers, and traders accustomed to the harsh climate, the slow pace, and the isolation. Like the hardy lichens and determined **reindeer** of the tundra, residents endure and do what's needed to survive.

Icewind Dale has few trees, so lumber is cut from the slopes of the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lonelywood Forest. Stone from the hills and valleys surrounding Kelvin's Cairn supplements wood as a building material in Ten-Towns. Homes have sharply pitched roofs to prevent snow from accumulating on them.

The people of Ten-Towns wear layers of woolen clothing often topped off with fur cloaks. Under these heavy clothes and cloaks, one resident looks very much the same as another. Outdoors, it's hard to tell the people of Ten-Towns apartÃ¢ÂÂand easy for clever monsters to hide in their midst.

## Running This Chapter

Getting off on the right foot is important. If you follow these steps, you should be all right:

- Before starting the adventure, read the rest of this section and the "Ten-Towns Overview" that follows it. A description of each town appears later in this chapter, but you don't need to commit all ten settlements to memory before running this part of the adventure.
- Determine the town in which the adventure begins (see "Starting Town" below) and read the description of that town.
- Once the players have their characters, backgrounds, and secrets sorted out, kick off the adventure by reading the boxed text in the "Cold Open" section.
- Give the players a starting quest (either "Cold-Hearted Killer" or "Nature Spirits"), or use the quest that's tied to the adventure's starting town (as shown in the Starting Town table).
- Whenever the characters arrive at another town for the first time, review the nutshell description of that town and give the characters the quest tied to that settlement (as shown in the Starting Town table).

### Starting Town

Choose one of the ten towns as the starting point for the adventure. It doesn't matter which one, so pick your favorite or roll randomly using the Starting Town table. If you can't decide and don't want to leave it to chance, choose Bryn Shander; it's the most cosmopolitan settlement in Icewind Dale, and it has all the amenities a fledgling party of adventurers could hope for.

##### Starting Town

|  1  |     *Bremen*    | "Lake Monster", in which the characters hunt for a monster terrorizing Bremen's fishers.                              |
|  2  |  *Bryn Shander* | "Foaming Mugs", in which the characters search for a missing supply of iron ingots.                                   |
|  3  |  *Caer-Dineval* | "Black Swords", in which the characters confront devil-worshiping cultists in a clifftop castle.                      |
|  4  |   *Caer-Konig*  | "The Unseen", in which the characters solve the mystery behind a number of petty thefts.                              |
|  5  | *Dougan's Hole* | "Holed Up", in which the characters cross paths with a pair of winter wolves and rescue two missing youngsters.       |
|  6  |   *Easthaven*   | "Toil and Trouble", in which the characters search for missing fishers in a hag's lair.                               |
|  7  |   *Good Mead*   | "The Mead Must Flow", in which the characters retrieve several stolen casks of honey mead.                            |
|  8  |   *Lonelywood*  | "The White Moose", in which the characters hunt an evil white moose that is terrorizing local hunters and loggers.    |
|  9  |     *Targos*    | "Mountain Climb", in which the characters search for an expedition that went missing on the slopes of Kelvin's Cairn. |
|  10 |   *Termalaine*  | "A Beautiful Mine", in which the characters go looking for trouble in a nearby gem mine.                              |

### Ten-Towns Quests

This chapter presents two starting quests ("Cold-Hearted Killer" and "Nature Spirits") that the characters can get at the start of the adventure, regardless of which town serves as their starting point. Every town has its own quest as well, as noted in the Starting Town table. Once you choose a starting quest, the other starting quests go unused. "Cold-Hearted Killer" has the potential for combat, while "Nature Spirits" presents a fun quest without the danger.

The quests in this chapter are designed to get the characters exploring Ten-Towns and the nearby wilderness, while quests that take them into the farthest reaches of Icewind Dale are saved for *chapter 2*. It's up to the players whether to complete a particular quest or not; the adventure doesn't assume that they'll complete them all, but completing at least five of this chapter's quests advances characters to 4th level (see "Character Advancement" below).

#### Ten-Towns Rumors

If the characters complete a town's quest and aren't sure where to go next, inform the players that their characters have heard rumors of trouble in a neighboring town, then roll on the Ten-Towns Rumors table to determine what they've heard. Roll again if the characters have already completed the quest associated with that town.

##### Ten-Towns Rumors
| d10 | Rumor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | In Bremen, fishers are being terrorized by a monster that lives in Maer Dualdon. Strange that none of the other towns on that lake have been harangued by the monster.                                                                             |
|  2  | In Bryn Shander, some dwarves will pay good money to anyone who can find a lost shipment for them.                                                                                                                                                 |
|  3  | In Caer-Dineval, no one has seen the town speaker for a long time. Locals say Speaker Crannoc has fallen ill, but sinister figures have been seen entering and leaving the castle at odd hours.                                                    |
|  4  | In Caer-Konig, local establishments are beset by vandals and thieves that skulk about unseen. The town speaker, a dragonborn named Trovus, could really use some help catching the interlopers.                                                    |
|  5  | In Dougan's Hole, people live in fear of winter wolves that haunt the outskirts of the town. As big as horses they are, and smarter than normal wolves.                                                                                            |
|  6  | In Easthaven, they caught an evil wizard who killed some adventurers. The town militia plans to burn the wizard at the stake. I hear the captain of the guard is looking for adventurers to help with another task that may or may not be related. |
|  7  | In Good Mead, the town speaker was recently killed by a nine-foot-tall giant. Rumor has it the giant stole a shipment of honey mead, without which a handful of taverns in Ten-Towns might go dry!                                                 |
|  8  | In Lonelywood, beware the dreaded white moose! It attacks loggers and trappers on sight, and the town's best hunters can't seem to catch or kill the beast. They could probably use some help.                                                     |
|  9  | In Targos, a band of adventurers is planning an expedition up the side of Kelvin's Cairn, hoping to find Oyaminartok, a goliath lycanthrope who can transform into a polar bear. If you hurry, you might be able to join the expedition!           |
|  10 | In Termalaine, Speaker Masthew has closed one of the town's lucrative gem mines. Apparently, a gang of kobolds crept into the mine and endangered some miners. Anyone who clears out the mine can expect to be well compensated.                   |

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, level advancement is handled as follows:

- The characters advance to 2nd level after completing their first quest in this chapter.
- They advance to 3rd level after completing three quests in this chapter and advance to 4th level after completing five quests in this chapter.

Once the characters reach 4th level, they no long gain levels by completing the quests in this chapter. Even so, completing more than the required number of quests can improve their standing in Ten-Towns (see "Reputation in Ten-Towns" below), and they still collect the other rewards for completing those quests.

#### Reputation in Ten-Towns

As the characters complete the quests in this chapter, their reputation in Ten-Towns begins to spread. For better or worse, they become known to the people of Ten-TownsÃ¢ÂÂsome of whom regard them as saviors, while others fear their boldness, envy their power, or covet the wealth they've amassed. Fame in Icewind Dale is always a double-edged sword.

The adventuring party's reputation in Ten-Towns improves as the characters gain levels, with the following results:

- When the characters reach 3rd level, they begin to earn a healthy measure of respect from Ten-Towners who know of their exploits.
- When the characters reach 4th level, they are given a hero's welcome in the towns they've helped but are given the cold shoulder in towns they've ignored. They also learn about new adventure opportunities outside Ten-Towns, as described in *chapter 2*.

## Ten-Towns Overview

Ten-Towns didn't spring up overnight. It started from humble beginnings four centuries ago. Immigrants from all over FaerÃÂ»n came here in search of escape or adventure and built a modest trade post atop the hill where Bryn Shander now stands. One by one, settlements sprung up on the shores of Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. The ever-present threat of orcs and other monsters compelled the poorly defended lakeside towns to turn Bryn Shander from a modest hilltop trading post into a walled town capable of defending all Ten-Towners if and when the worst comes.

Most of the towns contain trace evidence of the immigrant cultures that birthed them. This evidence is carved into houses, statues, and other fixtures. For example, the dinosaur carvings on the older buildings of Good Mead remind folk that many of its original settlers were Chultan.

Residents of Ten-Towns tend to remain indoors when they're not working, since it's so frightfully cold outside, which gives each settlement a deathly quiet aspect. Most people who venture outdoors are bundled up in so much cold weather clothing as to be barely recognizable, and they don't stand around long enough for the cold wind to get the better of them.

Auril's winter spell has caused the population of Ten-Towns to dwindle and has heightened rivalries that have simmered for years, turning neighboring towns against one another as competition for resources becomes increasingly intense. The alliance of Ten-Towns won't hold if the mounting tribalism continues to threaten the common good.

### Life Off the Lakes

Most of the ten towns except Bryn Shander are built on the shores of three big lakes. The largest population of knucklehead trout is in Maer Dualdon, the deepest of the lakes. Redwaters, the shallowest lake, almost completely freezes in winter, making the fishing there difficult. Lac Dinneshere catches the worst of the winds blowing off the Reghed Glacier to the east and thus has the roughest waters. Small thermal vents at the bottom of these lakes keep them from freezing completely, even in the coldest winters.

Ten-Towns fishing boats are simple affairs. The smallest are rowboats and single-masted skiffs that require careful handling to avoid capsizing. Larger, twin-masted cogs and keelboats with single decks handle the wind and waves better. These ships fly the flags of their towns and provide fish for the whole community, not for any individual fisher.

When thick ice covers the lakes, many fishers stay to the shelters of their homes and hearths, but the most dedicated or desperate cut holes in the ice and dangle their lines down in hopes of tempting hungry trout.

> ##### Fuel Sources
>
>The folk of Ten-Towns don't have a lot of options when it comes to keeping warm. People from Good Mead, Lonelywood, and Termalaine burn wood salvaged from nearby forests to heat their houses. In the other towns of Icewind Dale, wood is too precious a commodity to burn, so whale oil is used in lamps and small stoves around which townsfolk huddle for warmth.
>
>Ten-Towners buy their whale oil from whalers who live on the shores of the Sea of Moving Ice. Whaling is thus a lucrative (if inherently dangerous) business in Icewind Dale.
>

### Winter Survival Gear

Any item listed in the equipment chapter of the *Player's Handbook* can be bought in Ten-Towns, including fishing tackle and sleds. The larger the town, the more likely it is to have the item.

The Winter Survival Gear table provides costs for cold weather clothing, crampons, and snowshoes, which can be added to the list of things that characters can buy in Ten-Towns.

##### Winter Survival Gear
| Item                     |  Cost |  Weight |
|--------------------------|------:|:-------:|
| *Clothing, cold weather* | 10 gp |  5 lb.  |
| *Crampons (2)*           |  2 gp | 1/4 lb. |
| *Snowshoes*              |  2 gp |  4 lb.  |

#### Cold Weather Clothing

This outfit consists of a heavy fur coat or cloak over layers of wool clothing, as well as a fur-lined hat or hood, goggles, and fur-lined leather boots and gloves.

As long as cold weather clothing remains dry, its wearer automatically succeeds on saving throws against the effects of extreme cold (see "Extreme Cold").

#### Crampons

A crampon is a metal plate with spikes that is strapped to the sole of a boot. A creature wearing crampons can't fall prone while moving across slippery ice.

#### Snowshoes

Snowshoes reduce the likelihood of their wearer getting stuck in the deep snow.

### Getting Around Ten-Towns

![Axe Beak](img/adventure/IDRotF/008-01-002.axe-beak.webp)

Most Ten-Towners travel from town to town on foot. Those who need to transport more goods than they can carry use wooden sleds pulled by dogs or domesticated axe beaks as pack animals. Such things can be bought and sold in every Ten-Towns settlement.

#### Dogsleds

An empty sled costs 20 gp, weighs 300 pounds, and has room at the back for one driver. A *sled dog* (use the **wolf** stat block in *appendix A* of the *Monster Manual*) costs 50 gp and can pull 360 pounds.

Sled dogs must take a short rest after pulling a sled for 1 hour; otherwise, they gain one level of exhaustion.

#### Axe Beaks

An **axe beak**'s splayed toes allow it to run across snow, and it can carry as much weight as a mule. A domesticated *axe beak* can be purchased in Ten-Towns for 50 gp. See *appendix A* of the *Monster Manual* for the axe beak's stat block.

### Magic in Ten-Towns

Characters hoping to procure powerful magic items or the services of a high-level spellcaster in Ten-Towns are out of luck. At best, they might be able to find common magic items for sale, or a friendly **druid**, **priest**, or **mage** who can cast spells on their behalf. For every hundred people in a town, there's one such individual living among them.

Magic items and magical services available in Ten-Towns are summarized below. If an item or spell is not covered here, assume there is no friendly NPC who can sell or cast it.

Common magic items cost 100 gp each where they're available, except for common potions (such as *potions of healing*), which can be had for 50 gp.

A friendly spellcaster will charge 25 gp for a 1st-level spell, 50 gp for one that uses a 2nd-level spell slot, or 150 gp for one that uses a 3rd-level spell slot, plus the cost of any expensive material components.

### Snowflake Ratings

This chapter uses a three-snowflake rating system to help you quickly differentiate the settlements of Ten-Towns. Each town is rated in terms of its friendliness, the services it offers, and its comfort. The more snowflakes, the better the rating.

***Friendliness.*** Residents in a three-snowflake town are friendly and helpful, by and large. Conversely, a one-snowflake town is full of unhelpful, unfriendly folk. A two-snowflake town has both.

***Services.*** A three-snowflake town is where characters are most likely to find the services they need. A two-snowflake town has a much narrower selection. Characters will have trouble getting any sort of service in a one-snowflake town.

***Comfort.*** Characters can find decent food and drink, as well as warm beds, in a three-snowflake town. A two-snowflake town might have a small tavern plus an inn with drafty rooms to rent. A one-snowflake town might have a cold shed or attic where characters can crash for the night, and that's about it.

![A crag cat claims an offering of food made by Ten-Towners to appease the Frostmaiden](img/adventure/IDRotF/009-01-003.crag-cat.webp)

### Sacrifices to Auril

The desperate people of Ten-Towns, hoping to appease Auril so that summer can return to Icewind Dale, make sacrifices to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is a new practice that started a little over a year ago, when it became clear that Auril was angry and summer would not be returning anytime soon. The town speakers (see the "Council of Speakers" sidebar) have unanimously agreed to honor these practices, which they consider necessary evils, but would end them in a heartbeat if Auril were to be appeased or dealt with in some other way.

The nature of the sacrifices varies from town to town, but usually takes one of three forms:

- **Humanoid.** Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos hold lotteries the afternoon before the new moon. The unlucky person whose name is drawn is sacrificed at nightfall. The ill-fated soul is stripped bare and either tied to a post or sent into the tundra to die. Accusations of rigged lotteries are common but usually not acted upon.
- **Food.** Smaller towns that can't afford to give up people give up their food instead. A day's catch of knucklehead trout is strung up on wooden racks a mile outside town, to be claimed by yeti and other creatures that embody Auril's wrath.
- **Warmth.** Towns that can't bring themselves to give up their people or their food forsake warmth for a night. No fires are lit between dusk and dawn, forcing locals to share body heat for warmth. Anyone who dares to light a fire is savagely beaten.

> ##### Council of Speakers
>
>Each town is an independent settlement that elects a leader, or speaker, to represent its interests at meetings of the Council of Speakers, which are infrequent and take place at the Council Hall in Bryn Shander. These meetings are called to discuss matters of shared interest and to settle disputes between towns.
>

## Cold Open

Before beginning the adventure, give your players a chance to decide how their characters wound up in Icewind Dale, what their relationships are to one another, and what circumstances brought them together. Once the players are ready to get under way, use the following boxed text to summarize the situation:

>>Icewind Dale has become trapped in a perpetual winter. Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen. Most dale residents blame Auril the Frostmaiden, the god of winter's wrath. The shimmering aurora that weaves across the sky each night is said to be her doingÃ¢ÂÂa potent spell that keeps the sun at bay.
>>
>>Dalefolk live in a scattering of settlements known as Ten-Towns. The drop-off in caravans coming from the south and travel between settlements in this never-ending winter has left everyone feeling isolated. Although each town has resolved to appease the Frostmaiden with sacrifices of one kind or another, no respite from winter's fury seems forthcoming. For adventurers such as yourselves, Ten-Towns is a place to test one's mettle and, in the spirit of heroes who have come before, leave one's mark on this frigid, blighted land.
>>

Having set the stage, you can now describe the adventure's starting town using the information presented later in this chapter, and the poster map includes a map of the starting town that you can share with the players. The characters would be aware of the town's general layout and key features.

### Icewind Dale Knowledge

Assume that your party of adventurers is familiar with Icewind Dale's geography and landmarks, as shown on the poster map, as well as the names and locations of the settlements that comprise Ten-Towns. Characters from Icewind Dale know the following additional information, depending on where they grew up:

***Ten-Towners.*** Characters who have spent some time in Ten-Towns know the names of important residents, such as the speaker of each town, as well as the information in each town's nutshell description (as presented later in this chapter). They also know the names of the four tribes of Reghed nomads described in appendix C.

- **Reghed Nomads.** Any characters raised among the Reghed nomads recognize members of their own tribe, as well as the names and reputations of prominent members of other tribes (see appendix C).

***Mountain Goliaths.*** Goliaths who hail from the Spine of the World know of two rival goliath settlements in the mountains, Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag (both described in *chapter 2*). A goliath character who hails from one of these settlements would be familiar with its inhabitants, as well as their longstanding feud with goliaths from the rival settlement.

- **Valley Dwarves.** Shield dwarves and other characters who hail from the Dwarven Valley at the foot of Kelvin's Cairn would know that this valley contains sprawling iron mines and cave complexes inhabited by shield dwarves of the Battlehammer clan and their allies.

## Starting Quest: Cold-Hearted Killer

"Cold-Hearted Killer" is one of two quests designed to kick off the adventure. The characters can get this quest regardless of which town is the adventure's starting point.

The characters receive this quest from Hlin Trollbane, a retired bounty hunter who has been stalking a serial killer ever since she found a connection between three murders and a small trading company called Torg's. Hlin hires the characters to apprehend her suspect and dole out some cold, swift justice by quietly disposing of him if they believe he's guilty. This quest is no murder mystery; it's a hunt.

### Getting the Quest

To begin this quest, read the following boxed text to the players:

>>Just another gruesome day in Ten-Towns: howling wind, bitter cold, foul tempers, and snowdrifts big enough to bury a herd of moose. But today the local tavern is abuzz with news about a series of recent killings. Before the murders, the only question on everyone's mind was, "Will summer ever return to Icewind Dale?" Now the question is, "Will I be the killer's next victim?" Nothing breeds fear and paranoia like a murderer with no face.
>>
>>Three cold-blooded murders have been committed in the past month: a halfling trapper in Easthaven, a human shipbuilder in Targos, and, three days ago, a dwarf glassblower in Bryn Shander. Each victim was found with a dagger of ice through the heart.
>>
>>What's the connection? The drunken lot huddled in the tavern offers no credible ideas, but sitting apart from them is an elderly shield dwarf with a nasty scar across her nose who looks like she has something worth knowing. She's been smoking her pipe and eyeing you ever since you walked in.
>>

Hlin Trollbane, a neutral good shield dwarf, is a retired bounty hunter with finely honed survival instincts. She is an unarmored **veteran** who wields a battleaxe and handaxe instead of a longsword and shortsword. Plying her profession earned her a few too many enemies up and down the Sword Coast, which is why she wound up in Icewind Dale.

Out of boredom and a sense of moral decency, Hlin has taken it upon herself to investigate the recent murders because no one elseÃ¢ÂÂnot even the Council of SpeakersÃ¢ÂÂcan be bothered. Hlin is studying the characters closely, trying to decide if they're worth her time. Ultimately, she takes the chance and draws them into conversation, asking them to help her take down her only suspect: a man named **Sephek Kaltro**. Here's what she knows about Sephek and the victims:

>>"**Sephek Kaltro** works for a small traveling merchant company called Torg's, owned and operated by a shady dwarf named Torrga Icevein. In other words, Sephek gets around. He's charming. Makes friends easily. He's also Torrga's bodyguard, so I'm guessing he's good with a blade.
>>
>>"His victims come from the only three towns that sacrifice people to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is what passes for civilized behavior in Icewind Dale. Maybe the victims found a way to keep their names out of the drawings and Sephek found out they were cheating, so he killed them. Maybe, just maybe, Sephek is doing the Frostmaiden's work.
>>
>>"I followed Torg's for a tenday as it moved from town to town. Quite the devious little enterprise, but that's not my concern. What struck me is how comfortable **Sephek Kaltro** looked in this weather. No coat, no scarf, no gloves. It was like the cold couldn't touch him. Kiss of the Frostmaiden, indeed.
>>
>>"I will pay you a hundred gold pieces to apprehend **Sephek Kaltro**, ascertain his guilt, and deal with him, preferably without involving the authorities. When the job is done, return to me to collect your money."
>>

For the benefit of characters who are new to Ten-Towns, Hlin can explain that certain settlements (Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos) are making humanoid sacrifices to Auril, holding lotteries to determine who gets sacrificed on nights of the new moon (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

If Hlin's theory is true and **Sephek Kaltro** is killing Ten-Towners who cheat their way out of becoming sacrifices to Auril, it's likely the Frostmaiden will use him to kill again. Hlin is too old and frail to apprehend Sephek herself, but she has more gold than she needs, so she hires the characters to do her work.

The challenge begins with finding **Sephek Kaltro**, since Torg's moves around a lot. Hlin doesn't know if Sephek is acting alone or has the support of Torrga Icevein, so she advises the characters to isolate Sephek and dispose of him quietly, if such action is called for.

### Finding Torg's

You can randomly determine the location of the merchant company by rolling a d10 and consulting the Starting Town table (see "Starting Town"). Roll again if the result is the adventure's starting town. Conversely, you can forgo the roll and pick a town you like. *Bremen* and *Dougan's Hole* are good choices because they're small and isolated.

The characters can either visit towns one by one until they find Torg's, or they can try to get a solid lead before setting out. Any character who spends an hour talking to townsfolk can make a DC 17 Charisma (Investigation) check at the end of that hour. On a successful check, the character finds someone who knows Torrga Icevein's travel plans and is willing to share that information for a small bribe (at least 5 gp or nonperishable goods of equal value). Armed with that information, the characters can travel to the town by the most expeditious route.

#### Torrga Icevein and Her Caravan

The Torg's caravan consists of three heavily laden dogsleds, each one pulled by six friendly sled dogs. One sled carries provisions and supplies for Torrga, her team, and her dogs. It flies a flag bearing the company's emblem, a gold wolf's paw on a black field. The other two sleds transport goods for sale, including cut wood, flint and tinder, flasks of whale oil, blankets, furs, rations, bottles of wine, casks of cheap ale, fake medicines, and vials of poison (used primarily for killing vermin).

Torg's is an outdoor shop. Goods are unpacked and displayed in crates, with small canopies to keep the snow off them. Most of Torrga's goods are stolen or fenced, and she sells them for double the normal price. She has a protection racket that earns her a little coin on the side, and she also commits murders for profit on the sly. One of the larger sacks on Torrga's sled contains the frozen corpse of a male half-elf in his thirties with a stab wound in his chest. The half-elf had a bounty on his head and came to Icewind Dale to disappear. Torrga found him and killed him with Sephek's help. Once she's sold off her goods in Ten-Towns, she plans to deliver the corpse to Luskan and collect the 125 gp bounty.

Torrga is a neutral evil shield dwarf **bandit captain** with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned. While Torg's is open for business, she keeps her employees close to her. She employs **Sephek Kaltro** as a bodyguard and pays four others (neutral evil human **bandits**) to drive and protect the other two sleds. Torrga is interested only in profits, turns a blind eye to Sephek's murderous escapades, and tries to help him as best she can without endangering her own life.

***Treasure.*** Torrga keeps her proceeds in a small, locked iron strongbox, which she hides in a satchel. She wears the key to the strongbox around her neck. A character with thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the strongbox's lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The box contains 92 gp, 76 sp, 125 cp, and seven gemstones worth 10 gp each.

#### Sephek Kaltro

**Sephek Kaltro** (see the accompanying stat block) is a well-built man in his thirties. He has an olive complexion, dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, and no facial or body hair. He is dressed in a stylish vest with matching pants and boots, similar in style to those worn by mariners of the southern Sword Coast, but wears no armor or cold weather clothing and doesn't appear to be armed. His most striking feature is his eyes, which are as blue as a frozen lake.

The best way to deal with Sephek is to confront him while he's separated from Torrga and her other cronies. Sephek stays close to Torrga during business hours. Once activity drops off, Torrga shuts down her operation for the rest of the day, puts the dogs in a kennel and the sleds in a secure shed, and pays for the team's lodgings. After Torrga retires for the night, Sephek is free to do as he pleases until the following morning. If he happens to be in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, or Targos, he stalks his next murder victim. If he's elsewhere, he spends the night drinking and carousing, then falls asleep for a few hours, preferably in an unheated place such as a barn or an abandoned cottage.

When asked about his odd style of dress, **Sephek Kaltro** claims that he was born on the holiday of Midwinter and that the Frostmaiden's blessing protects him from the cold. In truth, Sephek was not born during Midwinter. He was a mariner whose ship sank off the coast of Auril's island a few months ago. He swam to the island but nearly froze to death. As his life was fading, the spirit of a frost druid beholden to Auril possessed him. The winter spirit cannibalized Sephek's spirit and is using him as a living vessel to do the Frostmaiden's work. The spirit can't leave Sephek's body; if Sephek dies, the winter spirit is destroyed along with him.

Auril inspired Sephek to travel to Ten-Towns and offer his services to Torrga Icevein. As Hlin suspects, he has been killing Ten-Towners who pay off low-ranking town officials to exclude their names from the lotteries in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos. Because he's doing the Frostmaiden's work, the spirit inside Sephek doesn't care about getting caught, and he isn't shy about admitting his guilt. He considers surrendering only because it buys time for him to escape and commit more murders. In combat, he wields a magical sword and magical daggers made of ice that he can conjure at will. These weapons melt and break like icicles in the hands of other creatures.

![{@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF}](img/adventure/IDRotF/010-637357081747240888.webp)

### Concluding the Quest

After finding and slaying Sephek, the characters can return to Hlin and collect their 100 gp reward. If they don't have evidence to prove that Sephek is dead, Hlin is willing to take them at their word. If the ice-dagger murders stop, she'll know her trust was not misplaced. Failure to stop Sephek allows him to continue slaying Ten-Towners who cheat Auril the Frostmaiden. These murders occur irregularly, and only in towns visited by Torg's.

If the characters capture Sephek and deliver him to the authorities, they stop the murders but lose the reward offered by Hlin, who isn't satisfied with that outcome.

If Torrga Icevein survives but has reason to believe the characters slew her bodyguard, she pressures certain Ten-Towners not to do business with them. At some later point, the characters might find themselves unable to buy something they need or denied lodging at a local inn because the merchant or proprietor doesn't want to earn Torrga's everlasting enmity.

## Starting Quest: Nature Spirits

This is the second of two quests designed to kick off the adventure. It prompts the characters to explore the various locales in Ten-Towns, where they can pick up other quests.

At the start of this quest, the characters are approached by a young spellcaster named Dannika Graysteel. A new resident of Ten-Towns, she's trying to find a way to alter the climate in Icewind Dale. She hires them to locate and capture a **chwinga**, several of which she believes are located in and around Ten-Towns. Although she provides the characters with a magical means to locate chwingas, it's up to them to figure out a way to capture one or convince it to help Dannika with her experiments.

### Getting the Quest

Begin this quest by reading the following boxed text to the players:

>>A bundled-up figure walks briskly up to you. "Well met! You lot seem like you're looking for work. Or trouble. You wouldn't be standing around in this cold otherwise."
>>

The speaker is Dannika Graysteel (lawful neutral half-elf **acolyte**), a scholar who thinks that wee elemental spirits known as chwingas might be the key to improving Icewind Dale's climate. Since chwingas are known to inhabit Ten-Towns and have some ability to alter their natural surroundings, Dannika thinks she can learn a lot by studying one up close. For the characters' services, Dannika is offering the group 25 gp as well as a *lantern of tracking (elementals)* that can help locate chwingas. She says she'll be at the local tavern each evening, so the characters should have no trouble finding her once the job is completed. If the characters accept her quest, Dannika gives them her lantern (see *appendix D*) and explains how it works. She then tells them she's been looking all over town and hasn't found any chwingas. She suggests the characters might have better luck in one of the other settlements. She could continue the search herself, but she's nervous about venturing out into the extreme cold and has other research-related chores to attend to.

#### Elusive Elementals

There are no chwingas in the adventurers' starting town, but each time they visit another town in Icewind Dale, there's a cumulative 25 percent chance of chwingas being present. Searching a town for chwingas doesn't take long if the characters use the *lantern of tracking*, since the towns are small and compact.

If the characters ask the residents of a town about **chwinga** sightings, people seem dismissive of the notion of elementals living among them. The occasional fisher reeking of dwarven ale might recall seeing "a tiny figure riding a fox through town" but can't remember where or when the sighting occurred.

### Thieves in the Wind

When the characters find a town that has chwingas living in or near it, the flame in the *lantern of tracking (elementals)* turns green as they approach the edge of town, whereupon they spot a bundled-up figureÃ¢ÂÂa human commoner named ElvaÃ¢ÂÂstomping out of a snow-covered cottage. Upon seeing the adventurers, she starts yelling at the wind and warning the characters to watch out for the curses it brings. According to Elva, trickster spirits have been opening her windows, sending horrible chills through her home, and knocking over her cups and plates. Some of her cutlery has even gone missing.

Characters who inspect the windows of Elva's cottage can make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a success, they find wee tracks leading away from a snowy windowsill of the cottage toward a nearby thicket. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check can discern three individual sets of tiny footprints. Some of the footprints have a thin furrow in the snow alongside them, as if something was being dragged behind the creatures.

#### Playing House

By following the tracks, a character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher can pick up the sound of movement from behind the conifers, where three **chwingas** (see *appendix C*) are playing atop the snow in a clearing. A dinner plate with branches and pinecones arrayed on it is placed between them, and one **chwinga** is sitting at the edge of the plate while the two others are moving a fork and a knife as if to cut and eat the "food."

When the characters enter the clearing, the chwingas look up at them with interest. The one not holding a piece of cutlery starts moving its hands, mimicking eating while looking up at the characters and making welcoming gestures.

If a character indulges in the game of pretend that is being played out, such as by sitting down and joining the dinner, the chwingas become excited and start inspecting the character in detail. After this, the **chwinga** that wasn't holding any cutlery begins following the character, remaining with that individual for up to a tenday, leaving the other chwingas behind. When the **chwinga** finally parts company with the character, assuming it has been well treated, it bestows a supernatural charm upon the character (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information). The charm can be any one of the following:

- A charm of animal conjuring, a charm of heroism, or a charm of vitality, all of which are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.
- One of the charms described in the "New Chwinga Charms" section in appendix C.

The chwingas remain docile unless a character acts aggressively toward them, whereupon they try to hide in nearby rocks, plants, or snowdrifts. They won't come out until they no longer feel threatened by the humanoids in their presence. Clever players might devise creative ways to lure the chwingas out of hiding, perhaps by doing something odd to gain their attention (such as engaging in a snowball fight or dancing in the snow). As the DM, you determine the success of such efforts.

### Concluding the Quest

If the characters return with a live **chwinga**, Dannika pays their promised reward of 25 gp, and they get to keep the *lantern of tracking*. If the characters brought a **chwinga** back without having to restrain or harm it, Dannika provides them with an additional 25 gp for their outstanding service.

# Bremen

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/012-01-005.shield-bremen.webp)

Founded by dwarf prospectors, the sleepy town of Bremen sits on the west bank of Maer Dualdon, at the mouth of the Shaengarne River. Bremen's harbor has frozen, requiring local fishers to haul their boats across the ice to put them in the lake. Visitors who lack a boat can reach Bremen only by crossing the river, which is mostly frozen over. Targos, Termalaine, and Lonelywood are all visible from the docks on clear days.

If Auril's everlasting winter has one benefit, it's that the hardy folk of Bremen are spared the seasonal floods that normally threaten the town in early summer. That's not to say that the long nights, frigid air, and howling blizzards provide any comfort. They don't.

Twice in the past two months, residents of Bremen have had to mount search parties for their town speaker and oldest living resident, Dorbulgruf Shalescar, and twice they've found him wandering the frozen shores of the Shaengarne in heavy furs, with no memory of how he got there. Dorbulgruf, old even by dwarf standards, isn't long for this world. Many locals fear the same is true of the town itself, if Auril's brutal winter does not abate.

## Bremen in a Nutshell

**Friendliness** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Services** Ã¢ÂÂ**Comfort** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

***Available Quest.*** "Lake Monster".

- **Population.** 150.

***Leader.*** Speaker Dorbulgruf Shalescar (lawful good shield dwarf **commoner**) speaks for the townsfolk. Age has addled his mind, and his vacant-eyed stare is often mistaken for unflappable calmness.

***Militia.*** Bremen can muster up to 25 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 2 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** A gold circle on a white field, with a horizontal blue band extending to the left under the circle, and a flaring blue triangle opening away from the circle on the right. The gold circle represents treasure found in the wake of local floods, the blue band is the Shaengarne River, the blue triangle is Maer Dualdon, and the white field represents snow.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Warmth (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivals.** Lonelywood, Targos, Termalaine.

## Overland Travel

Heavy snow has obliterated a trail that once guided travelers to Targos. Adventurers determined to make the journey on foot can reach Targos in 2 hours. Using mounts or dogsleds can reduce this travel time by as much as 50 percent.

## Locations in Bremen

![Map 1.1: Bremen](img/adventure/IDRotF/013-map-1.1-bremen.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/014-map-1.1-bremen-player.webp)Bremen doesn't have much to seduce or comfort the weary traveler, but the following locations marked on map 1.1 are likely to attract adventurers.

### Buried Treasures

*Inn*

This inn caters to treasure-seekers, specifically ones who pan for treasure along the riverbank in warmer weather. During the winter, this establishment has few, if any, visitors. The middle-aged innkeeper, Cora Mulphoon (neutral good human **commoner**), treats her guests like royalty while trying to conceal the fact that she is barely making ends meet.

***Cora's Loss.*** Cora is eager to please and apologizes at the slightest provocation if she thinks the characters are not pleased with her service. She explains briefly that her adult son and only child, Huarwar, used to help with the chores until two months ago. If the characters ask Cora for more information, she says that her son had joined a search party to find Speaker Shalescar after he went missing during a blizzard one afternoon. The speaker was brought back safe and sound, but Huarwar got separated from the others and didn't find his way home until the following morning. He had frostbite and could barely walk.

Over the next few days, Huarwar displayed a meanness toward his mother that was uncharacteristic. The change in his demeanor started after Cora found what looked like a shard of black ice in her son's room. Huarwar snatched it away and threatened his mother with bodily harm if she touched it again.

The next day, two tieflings (a male and a female) arrived at the inn and offered Huarwar sanctuary in their castle. He left with them willingly, taking the shard with him and telling his mother that he would never return. The tieflings wore amulets that looked much like the shard in Huarwar's possession. Cora misses her son terribly and she hopes he is still alive. She recalls that one of the tieflings mentioned a castle, and she knows that there are only two castles in Ten-Towns: an intact one in Caer-Dineval and a ruined one in Caer-Konig. The characters might encounter Huarwar in the keep at Caer-Dineval (see "Black Swords").

### Five-Tavern Center

*Five unaffiliated taverns*

Five taverns stand in a semicircle around a central yard in the heart of Bremen. As the story goes, five brothers originally intended to build a tavern together, but each had assumed he would be the one to run the business. Since none of the brothers would work for the others, each built his own tavern, and they all compete for customers.

The five taverns are called Stones, Even Keel, the River's Mouth, the Grumpy Moose, and the Black-Bearded Brother. The taverns are old and poorly maintained.

Characters who hang out in the taverns are likely to hear a rumor or two, which you can determine by rolling on the Ten-Towns Rumors table (See "Ten-Towns Rumors").

## Lake Monster

The characters can gain this quest shortly after they arrive in Bremen or if they start the adventure there. The quest starts near the docks, where the characters come upon a shield dwarf who mistakes them for fishers looking for work. Any interaction with the dwarf is interrupted by a half-elf who claims that a monster living in Maer Dualdon has been attacking and sinking fishing boats. The half-elf is a local researcher who has collected accounts from witnesses of these attacks and concluded that it's some kind of unusual beast.

Characters who search for the lake monster discover that it's an awakened **plesiosaurus**. A **frost druid** (see *appendix C*) recently cast an *awaken* spell on the creature, granting it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to communicate in the Common tongue. In return, the druid expects the plesiosaurus to attack fishing boats from Bremen, thus depriving the fishers of their livelihood and ultimately forcing the villagers to leave. The plesiosaurus feels obliged to heed the druid's wishes, for fear of losing this magical gift of sentience. Consequently, it attacks anyone from Bremen who fishes in its domain.

### Getting the Quest

>>The lake around the creaky docks is frozen, forcing fishers to pull their rowboats up onto the ice. Standing between a pair of boats is a stout humanoid in cold weather clothing. A gray hood hides most of the humanoid's face, but you can make out a wide nose and a long, frosty beard. The stout figure stamps their feet, spots you, and waves you over.
>>
>>"Good, you're here. Get to it, ingrates! Those fish ain't gonna catch themselves!"
>>

The speaker is Grynsk Berylbore, a shield dwarf (**commoner**) who owns the pair of rowboats tied to the docks. The gunwale of one of the boats has what looks like a large bite taken out of it, but both vessels are seaworthy.

Grynsk has been waiting an hour for some fishers he hired the night before to arrive. In fact, those fishers have decided not to bother showing up, having weighed what Grynsk offered to pay them against the danger of the lake monster. Grynsk was drunk when he hired the fishers and doesn't remember their faces; he assumes the characters are his new employees, and he's quick about setting them to work. If the characters ignore him or walk away, he yells profanities after them but doesn't pursue them.

Characters who approach Grynsk can see that his boats bear the names *Burly Ram*and *Pronged Goat*. The latter one sports the curious bite mark. Grynsk reminds the characters of what he calls "the agreed-upon price" of 5 cp for each trout they catch and scolds them for having already wasted precious trout-catching time.

If the characters explain that they aren't his employees, Grynsk frowns and repeats that the salary he's offering is 5 cp per caught trout, and "time is better spent anglin' than yappin'." He also grumbles in Dwarvish about the characters being stupid and needlessly rude.

If the characters ask about the damage to the *Pronged Goat*, Grynsk gives them a dismissive wave of the hand.

>>"Don't you see? Bloody ice everywhere. Last crew were apparently born with pits for eyes, because they sailed right into a damned ice floe! I ain't gotten around to repairin' the gunwale yet, but she floats just fine."
>>

A character who succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that Grynsk is lying. If he is pressured about the validity of his story, Grynsk becomes annoyed and tells the characters to get off his docks if all they want to do is ask stupid questions.

In truth, the lake monster took a bite out of the *Pronged Goat* and caused its crew to fall into the icy water, where they drowned. The damaged boat was found by fishers the next day, drifting crewless in the near frozen water.

#### Tali Comes on the Scene

Regardless of how the characters' dealings with Grynsk play out, they are joined by another figure before they and the dwarf part company.

>>You hear footsteps approaching on the creaky dock. Another figure covered head to toe in cold weather clothing has joined you. The figure wags a gloved finger at the frosty-bearded dwarf. "You have no honor, Berylbore!" the newcomer yells, pulling down a woolen muffler to reveal a pale, half-elven face. "You're sending these innocent people to their deaths. And for what, a few fish?"
>>
>>"Pay no mind to this rambling fool!" says Grynsk.
>>
>>"Did you tell them about the monster?" retorts the half-elf.
>>

Grynsk curses the half-elf in Dwarvish before turning to the characters and yelling, "Get to work!" He then stomps away out of earshot, not eager to hear what the half-elf might have to say but still interested in keeping an eye on his boats.

After Grynsk leaves the area, the half-elf approaches the characters sheepishly.

>>"I'm getting the feeling Grynsk doesn't like me very much. Or anyone who steps between him and the gold swimming in this lake. I'm Tali. I'm studying the local animal life here in Icewind Dale. I just couldn't stay silent and watch another crew fall victim to the monster of Maer Dualdon."
>>

Tali is a neutral good half-elf researcher (**scout**) who is in Icewind Dale to study how changes in climate alter the nature of the animal wildlife. Tali presents as neither male nor female and requests to be referred to as "they" or by name in conversation. Tali speaks with a soft voice and tends to go on longwinded tangents about the fauna that live in Icewind Dale.

When Tali heard reports of a creature in Maer Dualdon that was attacking the Bremen fishing parties, the half-elf decided to investigate and found that boats from Bremen were the only vessels to suffer these attacks. After deducing this, Tali began frequenting the docks to warn any uninformed people looking to venture out onto the lake about the danger waiting there.

Descriptions of the monster vary wildly; some witnesses say it's the size of an ox, while others say it's closer to the size of a house. Some say the monster might be a whale or a large fish, and others describe it as more lizard-like in appearance, with scaly skin and a long neck. If the characters ask about Grynsk's damaged boat, Tali explains that it was actually found adrift, its crew presumably lost to the lake monster.

Being a researcher, Tali would like to better understand the monster, which has only recently become a threat. "Perhaps this unending winter has affected its eating habits or demeanor in some way," speculates the half-elf.

>>"Tali hands you a notebook. "I can't offer you much other than my gratitude, but if you're going out on the lake, please write down any information you learn about the nature of this monster. If we know what's out there, the people of Bremen would be much safer for it. And, well, it bears the potential to be awfully interesting."
>>

Tali asks the characters to record everything they can perceive about the creature if they spot it, including its size, physical attributes, and general nature. Tali also makes it clear that few people have survived an encounter with the monster and encourages the characters to be careful.

### Unsafe Waters

The characters have the use of Grynsk's two rowboats (see the "Rowboat Statistics" sidebar). The damaged one has 36 hit points instead of 50. Three sets of fishing tackle are stashed in the center of each boat.

The lake is covered in ice floes, which make travel dangerous. As the characters row out from Bremen, their boats must steer around 1d4 + 1 ice floes. Any character who tries to steer a boat around an ice floe must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom check, adding their proficiency bonus to the roll if they're proficient with water vehicles. On a failed check, the boat hits the ice floe and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

> ##### Rowboat Statistics
>
>A rowboat has a speed of 1ÃÂ½ miles per hour and can hold up to four Medium creatures and their gear. An undamaged rowboat has AC 11 and 50 hit points. A rowboat reduced to 0 hit points in the water sinks over the course of 1d4 rounds.
>

#### Falling in the Water

Any character who falls into the lake is subject to the effects of frigid water (see "Frigid Water"). Even after the character gets out of the frigid water, the effects persist until the wet clothing is dried out or replaced with warm, dry clothing.

#### Water Depth

Once the characters are away from the shore, you can randomly determine the lake's depth in any given location by rolling a d20 and multiplying the die roll by 10 feet. Conversely, you can just assume the lake is 100 feet deep where the characters are.

### Scouting the Lake

The characters can use fishing tackle to try to catch some fish while they're searching for the lake monster (see "Fishing for Knucklehead Trout").

If the characters are out on the lake in a boat, roll on the Lake Events table at the end of each hour to determine what occurs next.

##### Lake Events
|  d20  | Lake Event                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  1Ã¢ÂÂ10 | The lake is still and quiet for the next hour. A fine time for some fishing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11Ã¢ÂÂ12 | The characters spot a rowboat from Lonelywood or Termalaine. It has 1d4 fishers (**commoners**) aboard and keeps its distance. The fishers are antisocial but nonthreatening. They fish in the vicinity for the better part of an hour, then head back toward Lonelywood with their catch.                                                                                                            |
|   13  | The characters encounter a keelboat flying the Targos flag. It has 1d6 fishers (**commoners**) and a captain (**scout**) aboard. They don't believe the lake monster is real and try to badger the characters into fishing elsewhere. They use trawling nets to fish in the vicinity for the better part of an hour, then head back toward Targos with their catch.                                   |
|   14  | A cold wind blows across the lake for the next hour. The lake's normally still waters become choppy. Until the wind abates, ability checks made to steer the boat and fish for trout have disadvantage, as do saving throws against the effects of extreme cold.                                                                                                                                      |
|   15  | A **knucklehead trout** (see *appendix C*) leaps out of the lake, makes a tail attack against one random character in the boat, and dives back into the frigid water.

![Adventurers encounter the monster of Maer Dualdon](img/adventure/IDRotF/015-01-006.monster.webp)

### Clever Beast

When a roll on the Lake Events table indicates that the lake monster takes an interest in the characters, read:

>>Ripples disrupt the surface of the lake, causing your boat to bob from side to side. A large mass glides through the dark water below you.
>>

A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check can identify the creature as a **plesiosaurus**. The creature recognizes boats from Bremen but does not attack indiscriminately, trying to gauge the strength and determination of the crew before deciding what to do. Roll on the Plesiosaurus Behavior table to determine how it acts. After behaving as described in the table, the plesiosaurus departs unless the characters do something that holds its attention. Once it departs, it doesn't return until a roll on the Lake Events table indicates another encounter with the creature.

The plesiosaurus prefers to dine on fish, not people. Characters knocked into the lake are more likely to freeze to death or sink to the bottom than be eaten. If a character harms the plesiosaurus, it reacts in kind.

##### Plesiosaurus Behavior
|  d6 | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The plesiosaurus breaches the water with its fins and splashes water into nearby boats. It swims to the bottom of the lake if attacked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  2  | The plesiosaurus rams a boat from beneath. (If the characters have more than one boat, randomly determine which one the monster rams.) The boat takes 3d6 + 4 bludgeoning damage, and any character standing in the boat must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A character who fails this check by 5 or more is knocked overboard and falls into the frigid water. |
|  3  | The plesiosaurus surfaces 10 feet away from a boat and takes a bite out of it, using its 10-foot reach. (If the characters have multiple boats, randomly determine which boat the monster bites.) The boat takes 3d6 + 4 piercing damage.                                                                                                                                                  |
|  4  | The plesiosaurus tries to capsize a boat. (If the characters have multiple boats, randomly determine which boat the monster tries to capsize.) Have the characters in the boat make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) group check. If the group check succeeds, the boat doesn't capsize. If the group check fails, the boat capsizes, and every creature in it falls into the frigid water.    |
| 5Ã¢ÂÂ6 | The plesiosaurus leaves without so much as a hello.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### Talking to the Plesiosaurus

Although the plesiosaurus gives no indication that it's intelligent and can speak, the characters might try to talk to it regardless. While the monster is underwater, it can hear the characters only if they scream at the top of their lungs and it's close by. Conversely, a *message* cantrip or similar magic can be used to get the plesiosaurus's attention. The creature is curious to hear what the characters have to say:

>>A reptilian head at the end of a long, slender neck rises out of the cold, dark water. The creature gazes at you intently and says, in Common, "I'm listening."
>>

A character who converses with the plesiosaurus and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can safely conclude that it's the beneficiary of a druid's *awaken* spell, and that the effect is permanent.

The plesiosaurus answers straightforward questions and knows the following information:

- "I used to just swim around the lake and eat fish."
- "The human who gave me this gift is named Ravisin and claimed to serve the Frostmaiden. Ravisin said I must do my part to help the Frostmaiden, who wants the people of Bremen to suffer."
- "I don't want to be a stupid beast again." (The plesiosaurus doesn't know enough about druidic magic to know that its awakening is permanent.)

A character must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the plesiosaurus to talk more about the purpose of its attacks. The plesiosaurus reveals that Ravisin instructed it to spread fear among the town's fishers. The plesiosaurus doesn't know where Ravisin came from or where she is now. Characters who undertake "The White Moose", the quest associated with Lonelywood, might encounter her later. If one or more characters mock or threaten it, the plesiosaurus grows angry and tries to capsize their boat.

The plesiosaurus is afraid to stop what it's doing because it fears the druid might take away the gift that has been bestowed upon it. A character can convince the plesiosaurus that its awakening is permanent with a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If this check succeeds, the plesiosaurus promises not to attack any fishers from the villages anymore.

#### Attacking the Plesiosaurus

If the characters attack the plesiosaurus, it dives below the surface of the water and remains submerged as it attacks the characters' boats from below. If it ever drops below half its hit points, it disengages from the battle and dives deeper, leaving the combat.

### Back to Bremen!

When the characters make it back to Bremen's docks, Grynsk shows up soon thereafter, eager to see how many knucklehead trout they caught. He honors his agreement, paying 5 cp per fish.

Tali is also eager to see the characters. If any of the characters took notes about the lake monster and hand their research over, Tali gives the party a *spell scroll* of *animal friendship* and a pouch containing 5 gp as thanks, then heads toward Buried Treasures to pore over the characters' notes. The characters can hear Tali mumble the words "interesting," "fascinating," and "remarkable" in Elvish as they walk away.

If the characters didn't take any notes, Tali's hopes are dashed, and no reward is forthcoming.

# Bryn Shander

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/016-01-007.shield-bryn-shander.webp)

The first stop for most visitors to Icewind Dale is Bryn Shander, a walled town perched atop a cold, lonely, wind-lashed hill. Bright lanterns suspended over narrow streets twist in the wind and add flecks of color to the town's otherwise drab surroundings.

The friendliness in this settlement has dwindled of late. Auril's unyielding winter has greatly reduced the number of visitors to Bryn Shander, and local trade is suffering for it, eating away at the locals' sense of humor and goodwill. Still, there is no safer place in Icewind Dale to spend coin or spend the night.

The walls of the town stand some 30 feet high and are defined by two concentric rings of upright wooden poles, the gap between them filled with dirt and rubble. The outer ring of poles rises above the top of the wall, providing a rampart for defenders stationed on the wood-planked walkway. The wall's hinged gates are 15 feet tall and can be barred from the inside with iron-banded wood beams. These gates are closed when it's dark outsideÃ¢ÂÂwhich is to say more often than not.

## Bryn Shander in a Nutshell

***Available Quest.*** "Foaming Mugs".

- **Population.** 1,200.

***Leaders.*** Speaker Duvessa Shane (lawful good human **noble**) speaks for the townsfolk. Though relatively young, Duvessa is the head of the Council of Speakers. Sheriff Markham Southwell (lawful good human **veteran**) commands the militia.

***Militia.*** Bryn Shander can muster up to 250 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 20 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** Black antlers above a vertical shaft of golden wheat on a white field, signifying the town's strength and prosperity on the vast, snowy tundra.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Humanoid (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivalries.** None.

## Overland Travel

Bryn Shander is connected to Easthaven by the Eastway, a snow-covered road. In addition, there are snowy paths to Caer-Dineval, Good Mead, Targos, and Termalaine. Travel times in the Overland Travel from Bryn Shander table assume that characters are on foot; mounts and dogsleds can shorten these times by as much as 50 percent.

##### Overland Travel from Bryn Shander

## Locations in Bryn Shander

![Map 1.2: Bryn Shander](img/adventure/IDRotF/018-map-1.2-bryn-shander.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/019-map-1.2-bryn-shander-player.webp)The following locations marked on map 1.2 are just a few of the places the characters might visit during their stay in Bryn Shander.

### Blackiron Blades

*Smithy and outfitter*

This combination shop and smithy stands just north of the main square. Garn the Hammer (lawful good shield dwarf **commoner**) manufactures the cheapest blades in Ten-Towns, while his sister Elza (lawful good shield dwarf **commoner**) sells adventuring suppliesÃ¢ÂÂincluding rations, cold weather gear, ice picks, and snowshoesÃ¢ÂÂto fortune-seekers. Most of the veteran sellswords in Ten-Towns disdain Garn's smithcraft, due to the uninspiring quality of his work. Jokes told about hapless newcomers to Icewind Dale often end with the line "an' 'e was carrying a Blackiron blade, to boot!"

### House of the Morninglord

![Sheriff Markham Southwell](img/adventure/IDRotF/020-01-009.markham.webp)

*Shrine of Amaunator (god of the sun)*

Located near Bryn Shander's northeast market square, this modest converted house serves as a gathering place for worshipers of Amaunator, a god of the sun known to take both male and female forms. A retired human adventurer named Mishann (neutral good **priest** of Amaunator) runs the shrine and aspires to see the sun regain its rightful place in the sky over Icewind Dale. She calls Amaunator "the Morninglord," a name that southerners use to describe Lathander, a god of the dawn and rebirth. Mishann views Lathander as a usurper of Amaunator's light and doesn't like it when people confuse the two deities.

***Copper Knobberknocker.*** Mishann rents her attic to a pessimistic rock gnome tinkerer named Copper Knobberknocker (chaotic good rock gnome **acolyte** of Lathander), who begrudgingly helps with services and chores. The two argue incessantly. Copper walks around in a fuzzy suit and hood that he made himself; although it's quite warm, it makes him look like a teddy bear.

If the characters talk to Copper, he tells them he's worried about a friend named Macreadus, who is conducting research at an old cabin in the wilderness (see "Black Cabin"). He says that if the characters find themselves nearby, he would appreciate it if they looked in on Macreadus, who's trying to build a device that could end the Frostmaiden's eternal winter and return summer to Icewind Dale.

### The Northlook

*Inn and tavern*

The Northlook is the establishment most frequented by mercenaries and adventurers, and as such it's the rowdiest and most dangerous place to stay in Bryn Shander. At the same time, its taproom is the best spot in all of Ten-Towns to get leads on profitable ventures, along with the latest news and rumors.

Characters who hang out in the tavern are likely to hear a rumor or two, which you can determine by rolling on the Ten-Towns Rumors table (See "Ten-Towns Rumors").

The inn's proprietor, a retired sellsword named Scramsax (neutral human **veteran**), knows full well the cycles of an adventurer's life. He often cuts a break for customers who are between jobs, allowing them to stay here on credit and then presenting them with a bill inflated by interest charges to be reckoned with as soon as they make their next payday. Those who don't settle their accounts discover that the old mercenary still knows how to handle a blade, and that he doesn't take "later" for an answer.

#### Ol' Bitey

Stuffed and mounted on a plaque above the hearth in the common room is a battle-scarred knucklehead trout named Ol' Bitey, who pulled many a fisher into the icy depths of Maer Dualdon before it was finally caught by a human rogue named Kintyre and her companion, a human druid who called himself the Maverick. They hauled Ol' Bitey to the Northlook in the hope of having it cooked for them, but Scramsax bought it from them and had it stuffed instead. Years later, some prankster wizard cast a spell on the stuffed fish so that it turns and snaps at any creature that comes within 5 feet of it. Occasionally, seemingly at random, Ol' Bitey sings the following verse instead:

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/021-01-010.bitey.webp)

>There's a place I like to go
>
>Farther up the river's flow;
>
>Where it is, I do not know;
>
>Must be under all that snow.
>

If a character has the Ring Hunter secret (see *appendix B*), the signet ring that the character seeks might be in Ol' Bitey's gullet, though Scramsax won't let anyone even handle the fish unless he's well compensated, and unless the deed can be done without ruining his trophy. (The ring, if you decide it's here, is stuck in the fish's throat and can be retrieved without surgery.)

## Foaming Mugs

The characters can pick up this quest if they start the adventure in Bryn Shander or shortly after they arrive in town. It begins when the characters learn about a group of shield dwarves who were forced to abandon a sled loaded with iron ingots, which they were transporting from the mines at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. The ingots belong to the Battlehammer clan and are stamped with the clan's iconic symbol, a foaming mug. The dwarves ask the characters to retrieve the sled and deliver the ingots safely to Blackiron Blades, for which each character will receive a gemstone as payment. Characters who complete this quest also earn a 10 percent discount on goods bought at Blackiron BladesÃ¢ÂÂa little thank-you from the establishment's grateful owner.

Complications arise when goblins find the sled before the characters do. The characters must either fight the goblins or finagle the ingots from them using guile or stealth. To further complicate matters, the goblins have a wagon pulled by hungry polar bears. The bears aren't fussy about what they eat, so clever characters might think to turn them against the goblins.

### Getting the Quest

Three frostbitten shield dwarves approach the characters at the Northlook or in the snow-covered street:

>>Three stocky figures bundled in cold weather garb stumble toward you. They have snowshoes slung over their backs and ice picks fastened to their belts, and two of them have thick beards. The third holds up a gloved hand and says, through a thick wool scarf in a raspy voice, "Well met! I'm Hruna, and these are my friends, Korux and Storn. We need help, and you look capable."
>>

The three dwarves work in a mine located in the valley at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. This mine is owned and operated by Clan Battlehammer, and it provides most of the iron for the smithies in Ten-Towns.

The dwarves wear cold weather clothing. Only their eyes are visible. Treat them as **commoners** who speak Common and Dwarvish; being dwarves, they have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and resistance to poison damage. They carry ice picks (1d4 piercing damage) instead of clubs. Each dwarf is briefly described below:

- Hruna speaks for the group in a voice made raspy by years of smoking. She has lost her right ear and two fingers to frostbite.
- Korux stares in silence and doesn't talk much. He has lost three fingers, two toes, and his nose to frostbite.
- Storn has a terrible fear of white dragons and glances nervously up at the sky as though he's expecting one to swoop down at any minute.

If the characters are interested in hearing what Hruna has to say, she presents the quest:

>>"We're the survivors of a group of dwarves tasked with delivering a sled of iron ingots to Bryn Shander. A yeti surprised us and killed a member of our group. The rest of us fled as the yeti tore Oobok limb from limb. Now we need someone to go back and get the sled for us. As payment, we offer each of you a gemstone worth fifty gold pieces. The friendship of the dwarves of Icewind Dale can also be a boon in these harsh times. You'll need snowshoes to make the trip in good time."
>>

If the characters slay the dwarves and take the pouch of gemstones that Hruna carries on her person (see "Treasure" below), witnesses report them to the town militia, leading to their arrest unless they flee Bryn Shander at once.

Korux can cover the expense of equipping the party with snowshoes if the characters are too cheap to pay for the snowshoes themselves.

If the characters refuse the quest, the dwarves leave in a huff and do not trouble the party again. They spend a couple days searching in vain for others to help them before returning home.

#### Treasure

Hruna carries a sealskin pouch that holds six *bloodstones* (50 gp each). Korux carries 15 gp in a yeti fur-lined leather pouch. Storn carries a rusty iron lock (3 gp) as a good luck charm; he lost the key that opens it.

### Search for the Sled

If the characters agree to complete this quest, Hruna points them in the direction they must travelÃ¢ÂÂstraight toward Kelvin's Cairn. The sled lies halfway between Bryn Shander and Kelvin's Cairn, in the middle of the tundra.

#### Blizzard

When the characters get within a couple miles of the sled, a blizzard sweeps down from the north and engulfs them:

>>A blizzard descends on you, reducing visibility to twenty feet. Kelvin's Cairn vanishes from view as the blowing snow and howling wind engulf you.
>>

Ask the players what their characters do during the blizzard, which lasts for 2d4 hours. They can stop and wait for the blizzard to pass, or they can press on. If they don't stop and wait, they could lose their bearings and veer off courseÃ¢ÂÂor worse, they could become separated (see "Blizzards").

#### Oobok's Remains

When the characters arrive at the location where the dwarves were forced to abandon their sled, read:

>>You crest a snow-covered ridge and see a frozen, dismembered corpse in the gully in front of you. Snow covers some of the gory bits, but the headless torso and severed limbs are visible. You see tracks in the snow all around the corpse, and the telltale grooves in the snow left behind by a sled that has been hauled away.
>>

The corpse belongs to Oobok the dwarf. The yeti that killed him ate his arms and most of his internal organs before leaving with poor Oobok's severed head. Both Oobok's tracks and the yeti's tracks were erased by the wind. The tracks that are present were left by goblins.

Characters who inspect the tracks around the corpse can, with a successful DC 10 Survival (Wisdom) check, determine that they are fresh (made in the past hour) and belong to a half-dozen Small humanoids wearing snowshoes. The tracks lead south. Characters who follow them for a half-hour catch up to the goblins, who are hindered by the sled they're hauling.

#### Goblins

When the characters find the goblins, read:

>>The creatures you've been following appear to be goblins, based on their stature. All six of them groan, grunt, and curse loudly as they haul the bulky sled toward what appears to be a twenty-foot-tall wagon parked in the snow. Harnessed to this conveyance are two roaring polar bears that don't look happy.
>>

These goblins were rolling across the tundra when their advance scout, a trained **hawk**, spotted the abandoned sled. The one-eared **goblin boss**, Izobai, sent six **goblins** forth to seize the sled and its cargo, while she and two **goblins** stayed behind to guard the wagon and keep an eye on the two **polar bears** that pull it.

At the start of the encounter, the characters are 120 feet behind the sled, and the goblins' wagon is 120 feet farther still. The goblins hauling the sled are too distracted to notice they're being followed, so the characters have surprise.

The sled weighs 300 pounds, and the iron ingots add another 600 pounds of weight to it. A single goblin can push or drag 240 pounds, so it takes at least four of them to move the sled. If they come under attack, the goblins take cover behind the sled and retaliate with ranged attacks. On the goblins' first turn in combat, one of them blows a horn to alert Izobai, who climbs to the roof of the wagon with a lit torch in one hand and her hooded hawk perched on her other arm. From this perch, she watches the battle unfold. If she spots enemies within 60 feet of the wagon, she orders the two goblins inside the wagon to shoot arrows at these enemies through gaps in the wagon's walls. These two goblins have three-quarters cover.

If five or more goblins are killed, or if Izobai is killed or captured, the remaining goblins are willing to negotiate a truce, though it's up to the characters to initiate the negotiations. The goblins are prepared to give up the iron ingots in exchange for their lives and freedom.

The prolonged winter has made the goblins as miserable as everyone else in Icewind Dale. If the characters act kindly toward the goblins, by offering them a blanket or some other gift, the goblins give up the sled and the ingots and allow the characters to be on their way. The goblins hail from the fortress of Karkolohk (see "Karkolohk"). Their job is to scour the tundra for food and treasure, as well as creatures to enslave, but they are cold and eager to return home.

Izobai fights only in self-defense. If defeat seems inevitable, she uses her torch to set fire to the wagon and flees into the tundra with her hawk, her treasure (see below), and any goblins in the vehicle. The wagon contains goblin beds made of straw; they ignite quickly, turning the vehicle into a raging inferno by the start of Izobai's next turn.

***Freeing the Bears.*** A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can approach the polar bears without aggravating them and use an action to free one of them from its harness. On a failed check, both bears are hostile toward that character for the rest of the encounter. A freed polar bear does not attack the character who released it, but all other creatures on the battlefield are fair game. It would sooner eat a goblin than anything else, given how badly the goblins have treated the bears. The goblins run away from a freed polar bear as fast as they can.

***Treasure.*** Izobai carries two *potions of animal friendship* and a sealskin pouch containing 13 sp, 25 cp, and a bone whistle (1 sp). The other goblins each carry 1d6 cp in sealskin pouches.

![Two surly polar bears pull a goblin wagon across the snowy tundra](img/adventure/IDRotF/022-01-011.polar-bears.webp)

### Concluding the Quest

Three hundred iron ingots are wrapped in thick burlap and tightly secured to the sled with leather straps. Each ingot weighs 2 pounds and is stamped with the foaming mug symbol of the Battlehammer clan. Each ingot is worth 5 sp to a blacksmith.

Once the ingots are returned to Hruna and then delivered to Blackiron Blades in Bryn Shander, the characters receive their promised rewards, including the 10 percent discount on goods they buy at the shop afterward.

# Caer-Dineval

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/023-01-012.shield-caer-dineval.webp)

In generations past, travelers to Caer-Dineval had to follow the rocky shore of Lac Dinneshere until after several hours they spied a small fortress (the "caer" for which the town is named) jutting up from the prominence where it overlooks the lake. A ferry out of Easthaven made the arduous trek unnecessary for merchants and other travelers, but the ferry was discontinued two months ago, cutting off Caer-Dineval (and its eastward neighbor, Caer-Konig) from the rest of Ten-Towns except by the overland route. Town residents are furious that the ferry service has stopped, mainly because they have not received deliveries of mead from the town of Good Mead, and the taverns have run dry.

As if things weren't bad enough, the town's harbor has frozen over, and the town's speaker, Crannoc Siever, has taken to his bed and is apparently too sick to make public appearances or press the Council of Speakers to get the ferry from Easthaven running again.

## Caer-Dineval in a Nutshell

**Friendliness** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Services** Ã¢ÂÂ**Comfort** Ã¢ÂÂ

***Available Quest.*** "Black Swords".

- **Population.** 100.

***Leader.*** Speaker Crannoc Siever (lawful neutral human **commoner**) speaks for the townsfolk. Known as a bully who shouts and uses theatrics to make his point, he has reportedly been ill for months and rarely makes public appearances nowadays.

***Militia.*** Caer-Dineval can muster up to 25 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 2 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** A crenellated stone watchtower (three merlons, two crenellations) on a dark blue field, with a horizontal red fish facing right beneath the tower, representing the town's vigilance, harbor, and proud fishing tradition.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Food (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivals.** Caer-Konig, Easthaven.

## Overland Travel

A snow-covered path leads from Caer-Dineval to the Eastway. Other paths lead to Caer-Konig and Good Mead. Travel times in the Overland Travel from Caer-Dineval table assume that characters are on foot; mounts and dogsleds can shorten these times by as much as 50 percent.

![Map 1.3: Caer-Dineval](img/adventure/IDRotF/024-map-1.3-caer-dineval.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/025-map-1.3-caer-dineval-player.webp)Whether arriving "by land or by lac," visitors are immediately confronted by the fortifications for which the town is famous: its clifftop fortress, known as the Caer, and the ruined watchtower at the mouth of the frozen harbor. Most of the town's buildings, which date back to the town's Cormyrean founders, line the path that winds down the steep slope from the Caer to the harbor, whose docks are perched on the rocky shore. Noteworthy places in town are marked on map 1.3, and map 1.4 shows the floor plan of the Caer.

### The Caer

*Castle residence of the town speaker*

This small castle was built over four hundred years ago by the Dinev family from Cormyr, before Ten-Towns existed as anything more than a few scattered camps of explorers living off the land. The Dinevs hoped to claim sovereignty over the unsettled lands of Icewind Dale. When the castle, dubbed Caer-Dineval, was completed, the workers and their families settled in the outbuildings they had constructed farther down the cliff, along with the families of the retainers the Dinevs had brought with them. Over the next few years, many explorers in the region came to see the Caer for themselves, and some built cottages in the shadow of its walls. No sooner had the small town taken hold than marauding orcs swept down from the tundra to put it to the torch. The town's residents tried to take refuge in the castle, but the Dinevs, alarmed by the size of the orc horde, barred the gates and refused to open them. The orcs fell upon the stranded people and slaughtered them to the last one. The Dinevs survived the initial assault, but not the siege that followed. After three weeks of being confined in the Caer, the Dinevs were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to resist when the orcs scaled the castle walls. Thus, the Dinev family's brief rule in Icewind Dale came to a bloody end.

The Caer remained in the orcs' possession for several years, until they were driven out by a small army of human settlers from other parts of the dale who banded together. The victors claimed the castle and its lands, and those with families brought them here to settle. Their descendants live here to this day and keep alive the memory of their ancestors' deeds.

Today, the keep is the residence of the town speaker, Crannoc Siever, who recently made the mistake of opening his doors to the Knights of the Black Sword. This group consists of people from all walks of life who owe their lives to the archdevil Levistus (see "Black Swords" below for detailed descriptions of the castle and the cult of Levistus).

### Dinev's Rest

*Closed inn*

At the south end of town is Caer-Dineval's inn, a drafty old building with boarded-up windows and a crooked weathervane shaped like a rearing dragon. The place has been out of business for almost a year.

Six **duergar** hide inside the ramshackle inn and remain out of sight until Xardorok's chardalyn dragon attacks the town (see *chapter 4*).

### The Uphill Climb

*Tavern*

This tavern is situated northwest of the Caer, where it offers a spectacular view of the lake and the frozen docks. The Climb serves hot chowder but is all out of beer and spirits, which might explain why locals don't frequent the place as much as they used to. The proprietor, a rugged middle-aged man named Roark (lawful good human **commoner**), blames the cursed winter and the closing of the Easthaven ferry for his business woes. Although he has spare rooms with empty beds, he claims to have no available guest accommodations. If adventurers are looking for a place to rest, he suggests that they try the Caer. Roark can't guarantee that Speaker Crannoc Siever's attendants will welcome them with open arms, given how sick the speaker has been of late.

Roark and some of his patrons know something is amiss in the castle, but they refrain from talking about it. Roark figures that if he steers adventurers toward the castle, they'll figure out what's going on by themselves.

## Black Swords

The characters don't get this quest in the customary way, which is to say that the residents of Caer-Dineval aren't counting on adventurers to help them. The quest falls into the party's lap if the characters decide to visit the Caer. Here are a couple reasons why the characters might go there:

- Looking for a good night's rest in Caer-Dineval, the characters are directed to the castle by Roark or some other NPC.
- A sad story told by Cora Mulphoon, the proprietor of the Buried Treasures inn in Bremen (see "Buried Treasures"), might spur the characters into searching the castle for her missing son, Huarwar.

Crannoc Siever, the town speaker, resides in the castle and is also a prisoner. Devil-worshiping cultists calling themselves the Knights of the Black Sword have taken over and confined Crannoc to his quarters while spreading stories about the speaker's ill health to conceal their presence and restrict access to the castle. The cultists keep the speaker alive in case they need him to make a public appearance. They can also use him as a hostage if the Ten-Towners take up arms against them. These devil worshipers keep a low profile while seeking out new members to join their ranks.

### Knights of the Black Sword

The Knights of the Black Sword are a secret society of cultists devoted to Levistus, the archdevil who rules Stygia, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from the confines of an ice prison from which he cannot escape.

Most of the cultists are Icewind Dale natives who would have perished in the wilderness had Levistus not intervened on their behalf. The cultists' stories are all the same: the archdevil reached out to them in their minds as they were freezing to death, offering a second chance at life in exchange for their absolute devotion. After they agreed to follow Levistus, a pale glow caught their eye in the snow nearby, leading to the discovery of a sword-shaped amulet of chardalyn. Each of these amulets has an inner radiance that provides warmth and aid, protecting its wearer against the cold while guiding them safely back to civilization. Once its wearer reaches Ten-Towns, the talisman loses its inner radiance, yet the cultists keep their amulets as signs of their devotion to the archduke of Stygia (see the "Chardalyn Amulets" sidebar).

The Knights of the Black Sword have members scattered throughout Ten-Towns. They welcome new members and answer to Levistus, who speaks to them infrequently using a powerful form of cross-planar telepathy. Levistus has recently called upon them to help another of their master's disciplesÃ¢ÂÂan albino tiefling wizard named **Avarice**Ã¢ÂÂachieve her goals. Even though they find her demanding and difficult to live with, they dare not defy her.

Levistus has warned the Knights of the Black Sword that duergar are plotting the destruction of Ten-Towns. He believes the duergar are acting on behalf of Asmodeus, the Lord of the Hells and his infernal jailer, but has not shared this information with the cult. The cult's oldest living member, Hethyl (a peg-legged shield dwarf who has lost her right foot to frostbite), hates duergar as most dwarves do. She has convinced the other cult members to forge alliances with anyone willing to oppose the duergar, including stray bands of adventurers.

The Caer serves as the cult's headquarters. The cult's presence is the worst-kept secret in Caer-Dineval, though few locals ever speak of it.

#### Game Statistics

The Knights of the Black Sword are lawful evil **cultists** and **cult fanatics** who speak Common and Infernal. They have the following additional trait:

***Icy Doom.*** When the cultist dies, its corpse freezes for 9 days, during which time it can't be thawed, harmed by fire, animated, or raised from the dead.

#### Cult Behavior

The Knights of the Black Sword take orders from Levistus, who speaks to them telepathically. The contact is one-way only, although a vainglorious tiefling cult fanatic named **Kadroth** falsely claims to have the archdevil's ear.

The cultists shun contact with outsiders and, posing as members of Speaker Crannoc's staff, turn away all visitors to the castle. If the time is right, however, they welcome the characters with open arms. That time comes when Levistus instructs the cultists, in no uncertain terms, to form an alliance with the party. For that to happen, one of the following statements must be true:

- One of the characters has the Runaway Author secret (see *appendix B*).
- The characters found and killed the group of duergar hiding in Dinev's Rest (see "Dinev's Rest").
- The characters meddled in the affairs of Nildar Sunblight (see "The Unseen") or his older brother, Durth (see *chapter 2*).

Once the cultists are told that the characters' goals align with theirs, they will do everything in their power to make the characters feel safe and happy, short of giving up their stronghold and their leverage over Speaker Crannoc.

Levistus tells the cultists to terminate the alliance if one of the following events comes to pass:

- The characters attack any member of the cult other than **Kadroth**, whom Levistus secretly despises.
- The characters harm **Avarice**, the albino tiefling wizard, or inhibit her efforts to plunder the lost city of Ythryn.
- The characters give up their fight against the duergar menace threatening Ten-Towns.

> ##### Chardalyn Amulets
>
>The chardalyn amulets worn by the Knights of the Black Sword have been corrupted by the magic of Levistus. A *detect evil and good* spell or similar magic reveals that the amulets are desecrated objects.
>
>Each day at dawn, roll a d6 for each chardalyn amulet in a character's possession. On a roll of 1, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become lawful evil, unless the character has that alignment already. Take the character's player aside to describe how the player should roleplay the new alignment. A lawful evil character craves power and tries to exert control over others, by being either cruel or manipulative.
>
>The alignment change can be undone by any magic that ends a curse, but after nine days, it can be reversed only by a *wish* spell or divine intervention.
>

#### Getting into the Castle

The characters need not wait for an invitation to enter the castle. They can make their way inside using any number of stratagems, including the following:

- The characters can ambush one or more cultists as they leave the castle on cult business, then use the cultists' amulets and garb to fashion disguises for themselves.
- With the aid of climbing gear or magic, the characters can scale the castle walls seen or unseen.
- The characters can use a *charm person* spell or similar magic to convince a cultist to let them inside.

### Approaching the Caer

When the characters first approach the castle, read:

>>A sturdy, stone castle devoid of warmth and ostentation squats atop the cliffs overlooking the town and the frozen harbor. Warding the castle entrance are thick, battle-hardened wooden doors. Four cylindrical guard towers have wind-worn flags bearing the town's heraldry fluttering above their tiled, conical roofs. These towers are connected by icy battlements and parapets. Atop the castle walls and within the guard towers, torches flicker.
>>

#### General Features

The snow-covered ground outside the castle is 10 feet lower than the castle's courtyard. Thus, the battlements and parapets that top the outer walls appear 20 feet high from the outside and are 10 feet high on the inside. Icy stone steps at either end of the courtyard climb to the tops of these walls, which are unmanned. Arrow slits in the outer walls of the guard towers and central keep provide three-quarters cover to those standing behind them.

Most of the castle is lit by torches regardless of the time of day. Doors inside the castle aren't locked unless the text states otherwise.

#### Castle Defenders

The castle's relatively small size makes it possible for one cult member to sound the alarm simply by yelling. If an alarm is raised, the following cult members are tasked with defending the castle:

- Twelve **cultists** of various races and genders, who normally reside on the ground floors of the guard towers (area C4).
- Two **cult fanatics** (a human named Huarwar Mulphoon and a tiefling named Fel Suparra), who normally guard the gatehouse (area C6).

### Caer Locations (C1-C9)

![Map 1.4: Keep at Caer-Dineval](img/adventure/IDRotF/027-map-1.4-caer-dineval-keep.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/028-map-1.4-caer-dineval-keep-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.4.

#### C1. Main Gate

Two lowered iron portcullises and two sets of closed wooden doors seal off the castle. The gatehouse (area C6) holds the mechanisms that raise and lower the portcullises as well as open and close both sets of doors. *Knock* spells and similar magic can bypass these barriers, which otherwise require siege engines to force open.

***Gate Guards.*** Characters who stand outside the main gate and announce their arrival can speak to the guards in the gatehouse. Unless Levistus has told them to do otherwise, they deny the characters entry, declaring that "Speaker Crannoc Siever is too sick to entertain guests!" If the characters claim to have one or more healers among them, the guards respond, "Speaker Crannoc Siever has no need for your heathen rituals!"

#### C2. Snowy Courtyard

>>Footprints in the snow lead to various doors along this courtyard's perimeter, including a tall double door to the keep, with its unwelcoming row of arrow slits and barred windows on the upper floor. To the east of the double door is a small, single-story building with a slanted, snow-covered roof. West of the double door are two unused merchant stalls with torn canopies. Tucked under some icy stairs in the northwest corner is a slender wooden hut with a crescent moon carved into its flimsy door.
>>

The hut is an outhouse, currently empty. Many tracks lead to and from it.

#### C3. Kennel and Sled Storage

Six friendly sled dogs (use the **wolf** statistics) are housed inside this kennel. They bark loudly whenever someone approaches within 10 feet of the door. The cultists can hear the barking but choose to ignore it.

A dogsled is stored here, along with the dogs' harnesses and reins.

***Kennel Boy.*** Sleeping among the dogs is an eight-year-old Calishite youth named Alassar Sulmander (neutral human noncombatant). He was found stowing away inside a crate of supplies that was delivered to the castle over a month ago and now does menial chores for the cultists. Alassar knows the layout of the castle (levels 1 and 2), and he can be coerced or bribed into helping the characters. He can move about the castle without drawing suspicion.

#### C4. Guard Towers

The lower level of each tower contains three **cultists** at rest. The furnishings on this level include six wooden cots with furs and matching footlockers (where the cultists keep their cold weather clothing). A copper brazier full of hot coals is situated in the middle of the room. Protruding from the brazier's base is a bellows that can be pumped to reheat the dying coals.

A wooden staircase hugs the outer wall as it climbs to the second level, which is unfurnished. Gusts of wind enter through the arrow slits on this level.

***Northwest Tower.*** This tower has two additional features on its ground level: a stone trapdoor in the floor, beneath which is a ladder that descends to area C16, and a secret passage to the speaker's office (area C9). The secret door is spotted automatically by any character who examines that section of wall.

#### C5. Armory

In the middle of this small room is a rack of twenty spears, and resting against the back wall is an unlocked wooden chest containing six *flasks of alchemist's fire*. Hanging from hooks on the walls are eight *longbows* and eight *quivers*. Each quiver holds fifty *arrows*.

#### C6. Gatehouse

This chamber is equipped with a system of wheels that raises the portcullises and opens the outer sets of doors. In the middle of the floor are murder holes through which arrows can be shot or alchemist's fire can be poured. The south wall has a row of five arrow slits built into it.

Two wooden cots covered with furs are in the northeast corner of the room. Of the two **cult fanatics** stationed here, one stands guard while the other sleeps. These individuals are briefly described below:

- Huarwar Mulphoon is a brooding, pessimistic human in his late twenties, the son of Cora Mulphoon (see "Buried Treasures").
- Fel Suparra is a tiefling. She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and resistance to fire damage. As Huarwar's friend and mentor, she's the one most responsible for tearing him away from his mother and pushing him up through the ranks of the cult.

#### C7. Great Hall

The double door leading to the courtyard (area C2) can be sealed shut with a huge crossbar. It takes an action to slide the crossbar into place or retract it.

>>This once-grand hall is dimly lit by chandeliers that are missing most of their candles. Three long tables in the center of the hall are littered with dirty dishes, which a young tiefling servant is slowly collecting.
>>
>>A stone staircase ascends to a pair of twenty-foot-high balconies that hug the walls. On the north landing, directly across from the main entrance, hangs a banner depicting the town's heraldry: a stone watchtower on a dark blue field, with a horizontal red fish facing to the right under the tower.
>>

The servant is a fourteen-year-old tiefling noncombatant named Mere, whom **Kadroth** found begging for food in Bryn Shander. Mere is frightened of **Kadroth** and would like to get out from under his thumb but can't figure out how. The servant knows the layout of all levels of the castle but can't be coerced or bribed into helping the characters until **Kadroth** is no longer a concern. Mere can move about the castle without drawing too much suspicion but trembles in **Kadroth**'s presence.

Mere knows about the cult's allegiance to Levistus and its animus toward the duergar. Mere has also met the albino tiefling wizard who has made a lair for herself in the cistern (area C22).

#### C8. Speaker's Den

This well-appointed sitting room is where Crannoc Siever used to meet with visitors, whether distinguished guests or concerned townsfolk. Comfortable furnishings abound, and the cultists keep a fire burning in the hearth.

Standing outside the door to the speaker's office (area C9) is a sadistic little klutz (human **cultist**) named Thoob, whose job is to serve at **Kadroth**'s beck and call. It's a mostly thankless role that comes with a mountain of verbal abuse. The only time Thoob feels rewarded is when **Kadroth** orders him to relay instructions to another cultist, in effect empowering Thoob to boss around others in **Kadroth**'s name.

![{@creature Kadroth|IDRotF}](img/adventure/IDRotF/029-01-014.kadroth.webp)

#### C9. Speaker's Office

**Kadroth** is a paunchy, lawful evil tiefling **cult fanatic** who has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and resistance to fire damage. From this usurped office, he coordinates all cult activities in Ten-Towns. It's a role he carved out for himself by asserting that he's tight with Levistus. He rules the roost by sheer force of personality, though it chafes him that Hethyl Arkorran (see area C13) has more respect and influence within the cult. **Kadroth** doesn't involve **Avarice** (see area C21) in cult affairs because he fears her spellcasting ability and her connection to the Arcane Brotherhood. She could take over the cult anytime she wanted, and **Kadroth** doesn't want to give her any reason to do so.

For all his political machinations, **Kadroth** is a visionary who has so far made the cult stronger through his actions and decisions. He spends hours behind his desk, staring into the burning fireplace and drawing inspiration from its crackling flames. The slightest disturbance upsets him.

**Kadroth** appreciates the wisdom of maintaining the illusion that Speaker Crannoc Siever is still in charge, if only to keep Caer-Dineval's townsfolk from becoming restless. Thus, when necessary, **Kadroth** has the town speaker brought to his office to sign official documents.

***Ring of Keys.*** In addition to his weapons and cult regalia, **Kadroth** carries a ring of keys that can lock or unlock every interior door in the castle.

### Caer Locations (C10-C19)

#### C10. Servants' Quarters

This room is for servants to rest, bathe, and clean their uniforms, and the furnishings reflect as much. After taking over the castle, the cultists imprisoned most of the speaker's servants (in area C24) because they couldn't be trusted, retaining only the cook (see area C11). Mere, the cult's tiefling servant (see area C7), sleeps here as well.

***Supplies.*** Against the west wall are three crates of torches next to a large, stacked pile of cut wood.

#### C11. Kitchen

>>This kitchen reeks of fish. It is furnished with stone ovens, a fireplace for roasting skewers of meat and boiling soups, and wood-block countertops. A portly cook busies himself at a table while a kettle belches steam over a fire in the hearth. A kennel by the door holds a pair of goats.
>>

The two **goats** are harmless and will eat just about anything. The cook, a human named Karou Salafan (neutral good human **commoner**), was not replaced by the cultists because he knows fifty different ways to cook and prepare knucklehead trout. Although he has some knowledge about the affairs of the keep, he doesn't want to know about any shady business, so he keeps his head down and his lips shut tightly.

#### C12. Kadroth's Bedchamber

A large, gilded mirror covering most of the east wall is what made **Kadroth** want this room for himself. Other furnishings include an ornately carved wooden table and chair, where **Kadroth** takes his meals. **Kadroth**'s black **cat**, Touche, is the chamber's sole occupant, although Mere (see area C7) routinely checks on the fire to make sure the room stays warm.

#### C13. Soothsayer's Room

>>A chilly draft wafts through this bedroom despite a roaring fire in the hearth. Bundled under a thick quilt and seated in a squat rocking chair in front of the fire is a venerable dwarf with a wooden peg where her right foot should be. Next to her, on a small table, is a plate of food. "I've been dreading this moment," she says.
>>

The shield dwarf in the rocking chair is Hethyl Arkorran, a noncombatant. She is the cult's soothsayer and oldest memberÃ¢ÂÂtoo old, in fact, to harm anyone. On the plate next to her is a knucklehead trout fillet topped with goat's milk. Hethyl won't touch it, because she's sick to death of trout.

![Hethyl Arkorran](img/adventure/IDRotF/030-01-015.Hethyl.webp)

Hethyl is a heartless creatureÃ¢ÂÂnot cruel out of spite, just blunt in a mean, uncaring way. She doesn't hide the truth or mince words, and she knows her soul is going to the Nine Hells when she dies. She also sees glimpses of the future, which means she's rarely shocked by what happens around her. These revelations have kept the cultists one step ahead of their enemies for a long time, but Hethyl's health is failing, and there's nothing that can be done for her given her age. She considers **Kadroth** a worthy leader but lost his respect when she told him that Levistus hates his guts. **Kadroth** has tried hard to forget that conversation and looks forward to the day when Hethyl drops dead.

Hethyl has foreseen her doom. She dies of natural causes immediately after sharing the following information with the characters:

- **Xardorok Sunblight**, a duergar warlord, will conquer Icewind Dale unless the characters defeat him.
- Xardorok has a fortress on the surface, hidden in the Spine of the World. It contains, among other things, a forge powered by the still-beating heart of a red dragon.
- Xardorok has a plan for the systematic destruction of Ten-Towns, which the characters can discover if they search his fortress.
- The characters will die if they face Xardorok too soon. They must test their mettle against the horrors that haunt the farthest reaches of Icewind Dale before they can hope to survive the perils of Xardorok's fortress.

#### C14. Speaker's Bedchamber

>>This room is immaculately furnished. It has all the trappings of a royal bedchamber, including a soft bed, warm quilts, elegant tapestries, and a gilded chamber pot. Bars over the windows dispel the air of luxury somewhat, as does the guard standing just inside the door.
>>

A human **cultist** named Yajath has the unenviable task of guarding Speaker Siever and making sure he doesn't leave this room. Once the characters deal with Yajath, they can reckon with the town speaker:

>>Squatting in the far corner of the room is a pale man wearing a nightgown. He has an unkempt beard and seems hard at work filling a chamber pot. "Perfect timing," he says, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
>>

Speaker Crannoc Siever (lawful neutral human **commoner**), a 49-year-old unmarried man, has been under house arrest for the past two weeks. Although he's not the picture of good health, he's not deathly ill, as the cult's propaganda would have others believe. The only time Crannoc is permitted to leave this room is when **Kadroth** needs him to sign paperwork in area C9.

The cultists slew the speaker's guards but are keeping his servants alive. Crannoc has been warned to behave himself, lest his servants pay the ultimate price. He doesn't know where the servants are being held, but he knows the cook is still making meals. He suspects the rest are being kept in the cistern under the castle.

Crannoc won't be happy until he regains control of the castle and his captors are punished for their crimes. He has little to say about his captors, since they don't share information with him:

- His captors arrived under false pretenses, claiming to be neutral arbiters employed by the Council of Speakers to help Caer-Dineval resolve its fishing disputes with Easthaven and Caer-Konig.
- The one calling the shots is a tiefling named **Kadroth**, who answers to someone named Levistus.

#### C15. Old Library

>>This room was set on fire years ago and never repaired. Evidence remains of floor-to-ceiling shelves along the walls. A draft issues from a darkened fireplace, stirring the cobwebs around it.
>>

Caer-Dineval's founders, the Dinev family, brought with them an extensive collection of rare books. That collection, stored here, was burned by orcs when the castle was sacked many years ago. The room has not been used since.

#### C16. Under the Castle

If characters peer down through the open trapdoor in the northwest guard tower, read:

>>A wooden ladder clings to the west wall, held in place with iron brackets. The ladder descends twelve feet to a hall made of mortared stone lit and heated by four sputtering torches. Extending from the east end of the hall is a water-filled cistern. A small rowboat is tied off near the water's edge.
>>

A 5-foot-wide, 8-foot-high passage in the north wall leads to area C17. For more information about the cistern and the rowboat, see area C18.

#### C17. Cold Storage

>>This room is empty except for four sheet-wrapped bodies lying side by side on the floor.
>>

The bodies are the remains of four cultists (three humans and a halfling) who were killed by the speaker's guards during the hostile takeover of the castle. The ground is too frozen to bury them, so they're being kept here in cold storage.

Old furniture used to be kept here, but it has long since been smashed to kindling and burned for heat.

#### C18. West Cistern

>>Stone steps descend into the icy water that partially floods this twenty-foot-wide, arched tunnel, which continues eastward into darkness. The roof arches twelve feet above the water, which is eight feet deep. The rowboat tethered at the water's edge looks safe to use.
>>

Any character who gives the frigid water more than a passing glance can see swollen, half-frozen bodies near the bottom, weighed down by their chain shirts. There are six human corpses and six dwarf corpses in allÃ¢ÂÂthe remains of the castle guards killed by the cultists.

A 5-foot-wide, 8-foot-high passage cuts into the north wall 20 feet beyond the rowboat, leading to area C19. A similar passage farther east leads south to area C20.

***Eastern Door.*** At the eastern end of the cistern is a 10-foot-square, 2-foot-thick, half-submerged slab of blue marble that blocks access to area C23. This slab is far enough away that characters won't see it with torches or darkvision unless they move farther into the cistern. The lever that lowers and raises this gate is in area C22. The gate can also be opened with a *knock* spell or similar magic.

***Rowboat.*** This boat comes with two oars and can hold two Medium characters plus their gear.

#### C19. Storage

Characters can use the rowboat to reach this area, the floor of which is above the water level in the cistern (area C18). A harmless **rat** chews through the corner of a sack of grain lying on the floor. This room is otherwise empty.

### Caer Locations (C20-C24)

#### C20. Shrine to Levistus

>>Frost covers the floor of this dark, fifteen-foot-square room. To your left and right are narrow tunnels, and across from the entrance stands an eight-foot-tall pillar of ice with a horned, pale-skinned, humanoid figure trapped inside it. The pillar is wrapped in black chains, and the wall behind it is covered with brown fungus.
>>

The figure in the pillar is a wooden mannequin painted and dressed to resemble the archdevil Levistus. The mannequin was encased in ice, which was chiseled into a pillar shape and wrapped in chains. The ice is kept frozen at all times by the 10-foot-square patch of brown mold growing on the wall behind it (see "*Brown Mold*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). Any creature that touches the pillar of ice is close enough to the brown mold to be harmed by it.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check can guess, correctly, that the cultists use this frozen, chain-wrapped effigy as an altar.

#### C21. Avarice's Quarters

>>This room is the private quarters of an albino tiefling who sits at a small desk in the dark, writing in a book with white leather covers. An ink-black crow perches on one of her horns and seems to read along with her scrivening. Without taking her eyes off the page, she says to you, "Get out."
>>

Other furnishings in this former storeroom include a red rug, a narrow bed, and a freestanding mirror in a wooden frame, none of which are remarkable.

The albino tiefling is a member of the Arcane Brotherhood named **Avarice** (see *appendix C*). The **raven** is her familiar, Skelm. Levistus sent a telepathic message to **Avarice**, urging her not to antagonize a certain party of adventurers until they've helped her reach her goal: the lost Netherese city of Ythryn. Realizing that the characters are the ones Levistus warned her about, she tries to be as hospitable as possible but won't discuss why she's here or what she's after.

If she no longer feels safe in the castle, **Avarice** leaves without a fight. (There are plenty of other places in Ten-Towns where she can make herself comfortable.)

**Avarice**'s two **gargoyles**, Gargle and Gurgle, are not present. She recently sent them to spy on her wizardly rivals. **Avarice** can speak to her gargoyles telepathically, thanks to her *Rary's telepathic bond* spell, and orders them back to the castle as soon as the characters confront her. If the characters slay or capture **Avarice**, the gargoyles attack them as they leave the keep.

***Treasure.*** **Avarice** keeps her *staff of frost* within easy reach. When she's not writing in her spellbook, she sticks it in a fur-lined satchel. See **Avarice**'s description in appendix C for more information about the spellbook.

#### C22. Iron Lever

This unlit room is empty except for an iron lever that protrudes from an iron plate embedded in the north wall. This lever raises and lowers the blue marble slab that seals off area C23.

#### C23. East Cistern

The dark cistern continues for another 40 feet beyond the blue marble slab. The water in this part of the cistern is thankfully free of half-frozen corpses. A narrow tunnel carved into the north wall leads to area C24.

#### C24. Prisoners

After the cultists took over the castle, they trapped most of the servants in this area.

>>A five-foot-wide, eight-foot-high tunnel leads to a dark, cold room that reeks of filth.
>>

Five of the speaker's servants (unarmed human **commoners**) have been trapped here by the cult for the past two weeks. All of them are malnourished, since the cultists feed them only once every few days. The servants are briefly described below:

**Lanthis Alderdusk** is Speaker Crannoc's 64-year-old assistant, notary, and scribe. He's feisty and spry for his age.

**Elprekt Norbrav** is the effete, tall, skeletally thin, 55-year-old butler.

**Mylbara Norbrav** is Elprekt's stout, 45-year-old wife and the speaker's Dwarvish translator.

**Tam Sharf**, a mute, 30-year-old petty thief wanted for a murder in Luskan, is the speaker's housemaid.

**Dassir Ravenscar** is the speaker's shy, 25-year-old dogkeeper.

These servants have decided to mount a prison break. When they hear the blue stone slab open in area C23, they hide. If the characters make their identities known before entering the room, the servants come forward and plead with the characters to free them. Otherwise, the servants try to ambush the first character to enter the room. They roll initiative as a group and make one grapple attempt only, with advantage on the d20 roll. (Apply no modifiers to the roll.) If they fail to grapple the character, they scurry to the far corners of the room and huddle in defeat.

### Outcome: Dark Alliance

Characters who forge a friendly relationship with the Knights of the Black Sword can use the Caer as a base of operations, coming and going for as long as this dark alliance lasts. The northeast guard tower is set aside for them to stay in. **Avarice** tries to minimize her contact with the party during this time; meanwhile, her gargoyles take shifts atop the southwest guard tower, from where they can watch the characters come and go.

### Outcome: Routing the Cultists

If the characters rout the cultists and release Speaker Crannoc Siever, the speaker asks them to call out the town militia so that the castle can be refortified. Henceforth, the speaker lets the characters rest at the castle whenever they need to. His home is their home, so to speak. Characters will quickly learn that the speaker is a blowhard and firebrand who enjoys living like a king behind his castle walls.

Without their leaders, **Kadroth** and Hethyl, the Knights of the Black Sword are rudderless until **Avarice** finally steps up to fill the power vacuum. The characters are doomed to cross paths with the cultists again in chapter 7.

# Caer-Konig

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/031-01-016.shield-caer-konig.webp)

The white, snow-covered slopes of Kelvin's Cairn loom large behind this quiet lakeside town. Caer-Konig started as a camp for a group of mountaineers from the northern Moonsea region. As the camp grew, a wooden palisade was added to discourage raiders. Later came the stone castle of Caer-Konig. Alas, neither the palisade nor the castle fared well; both fell to orcs before falling into ruin.

Caer-Konig as it is known today consists of terraced rows of houses that recede from the shore of Lac Dinneshere like the tiers of an amphitheater. The harbor is frozen, its docks skewed and broken by the shifting ice. Buried under the snow on the slopes above the last row of houses are the ruins of the Caer that gave the town its nameÃ¢ÂÂa reminder to the people of Caer-Konig that nothing lasts in this corner of the world.

Travel to and from this remote town was expedited by the ferry that ran out of Easthaven, but with the ferry shut down, Caer-Konig is completely cut off by mountains, lake, and snow. Forced to live on what they can haul out of the iced-over lake, the people of Caer-Konig are bitter and angry. They believe that the rest of Ten-Towns has abandoned them. The only thing that keeps the townsfolk from leaving is the beer at the local tavern, which never seems to run out.

As if things weren't bad enough, the town has suffered several mysterious break-ins recently, with no evidence of the intruders except dwarven boot tracks in the snow leading north. Since there are no known settlements in that direction, the townsfolk assume that Auril's everlasting winter has taken its toll on the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn, forcing them to come down from the mountain in search of food or beer. In truth, the town is beset by invisible duergar searching for chardalyn.

The town speaker, a heavy-drinking dragonborn named Trovus, patrols at night to keep an eye out for trouble. In his inebriated state, however, Trovus is prone to wandering out onto the icy lake or passing out on the ramshackle docks, and he almost never remembers his nightly patrols once his head clears.

**Friendliness** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Services** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Comfort** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

***Available Quest.*** "The Unseen".

- **Population.** 150.

***Leader.*** Speaker Trovus (neutral good silver dragonborn **veteran**), a retired adventurer, represents the town. Trovus won over his fellow townsfolk with his brawn and good humor, though he's too blunt to be a good politician and drinks too much.

***Militia.*** Caer-Konig can muster up to 25 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 2 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** A white fish silhouette rising from the center bottom of a dark blue field, which has a white border on all sides but its bottom. The fish signifies the local fishing trade, and the broken border represents the snow and the harbor surrounding the town.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Food (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivals.** Caer-Dineval, Easthaven.

## Overland Travel

A three-mile-long, snow-covered path links Caer-Konig to the neighboring town of Caer-Dineval. Characters on foot can walk this path in 2 hours; mounts and dogsleds can shorten this time by as much as 50 percent.

## Locations in Caer-Konig

![Map 1.5: Caer-Konig](img/adventure/IDRotF/032-map-1.5-caer-konig.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/033-map-1.5-caer-konig-player.webp)The following locations are marked on map 1.5.

### Hook, Line, and Sinker

*Tavern*

This tavern owes its popularity to the free half-pints of ale that the proprietor, Eglendar "Glen" Korr (neutral good half-elf **commoner**), keeps on the table by the front door. He presses one into the hand of every person who stops by (the hook), which compels most of them to stay to order seconds and thirds (the line). The "sinker" part of the tavern's name refers both to the last drink call of the night andÃ¢ÂÂwhen locals challenge visitors to a drinking contestÃ¢ÂÂto the last drink that sends a losing contestant under the table.

Glen gets his ale from the dwarves who live in the valley at the foot of Kelvin's Cairn, and he pays Jarthra the dwarf (see "Frozenfar Expeditions" below) to fetch it for him.

### Frozenfar Expeditions

*Adventuring outfitter*

Run by a seasoned ranger named Atenas Swift (neutral good human **scout**), this shop sells adventuring gear. Attached to the shop is a locked wooden shed where Atenas stores a pair of dogsleds and a kennel where he keeps a dozen healthy sled dogs (use the **wolf** stat block to represent them). Six dogs are enough to pull each sled. Helping Atenas run the shop is an experienced mountain guide named Jarthra Farzassh (lawful good shield dwarf **scout**). The two have an excellent rapport, mixed with some competitive ribbing.

Age has caught up with Atenas. He can feel the cold in his joints and ventures out less frequently than he once did. Nowadays, he prefers to stay indoors while offering Jarthra's services as a wilderness guide.

### The Northern Light

*Inn*

The inn gets its name from a magic lantern that once hung above the front door. An invisible duergar stole it recently, depriving the establishment of some of its charm.

The inn is kept by the Shorard sisters (neutral good human **commoners**). The younger, Allie, is lithe and charming; she greets guests and does all the cleaning. The older, Cori, is stout and scowling; she sees to the inn's provisioning and handles all the cooking. The sisters cast baleful glances at one another and bicker behind closed doors, but nothing ever comes of their feuds, as evidenced by the fact that they've been running the inn together for more than a decade.

![Trovus, the dragonborn town speaker of Caer-Konig, partakes of a drink as he guards the Northern Light](img/adventure/IDRotF/034-01-017.trovus.webp)

## The Unseen

The characters can pick up this quest if they start the adventure in Caer-Konig or when they arrive in town. It begins as the characters enter the quiet village, which is being tormented by invisible thieves.

Led by **Xardorok Sunblight**'s younger son, Nildar, invisible duergar are searching Caer-Konig for chardalyn, bringing whatever interesting things they find back to their outpost on the side of Kelvin's Cairn. It's up to the characters whether they help the people of Caer-Konig restore their stolen valuables, or confront the duergar for their own personal gain.

### Getting the Quest

>>The town sits quietly at the foot of Kelvin's Cairn. A few bundled-up people shuffle between snow-battered houses, keeping their heads down, barely bothering to give you a look as you walk past them.
>>
>>A pile of snow stirs as you pass it, and someone hidden beneath it suddenly stands. The figure looks around and yells, "Who goes there? Is it thieves? Have I found those creeping bastards?"
>>
>>When he pulls down the scarf covering his face, you see it is a silver dragonborn holding onto an empty wine bottle as if it was a weapon. He belches, grins at you, and says, "Pardon my manners. Bit jittery with all the thieving going on. I'm Trovus, the town speaker."
>>

Trovus (neutral good silver dragonborn **veteran**) spends most of his days drinking and reminiscing about his bygone adventuring days. He's been patrolling at night looking for thieves, but after yet another night of heavy drinking, he passed out in the snow after a few hours. He has no recollection of how he ended up in the snow pile or why he was outside drinking in the first place.

If he's asked about the thieves, Trovus takes a deep breath, trying to suppress his hiccups, before explaining the situation:

>>"The town has had some thievery troubles. No one's seen anything, really. Just the other night, the lantern over at the Northern Light was stolen. Cori won't let me hear the end of it because I haven't been able to find those responsible. Not yet, anyway. But I have a knack for this stuff."
>>

If he's not stopped, Trovus starts a long speech about the adventures he went on in his younger days. His stories include one where he kicked a half-ogre into a river and watched it float away while it yelled profanities at him. Another tells of the time he tricked a group of kobolds into believing he was a dragon in humanoid form.

If the characters ask about the missing lantern, he offers to take them to the local inn so they can talk to the Shorard sisters, who run the establishment. He seems less bothered by the cold than anyone else in the settlement, due to his silver dragon heritage. As they walk, Trovus talks about what has been taken from Caer-Konig over the past three nights:

- A color-switching magic lantern, taken from the local inn
- A pair of goats, stolen from the local tavern
- A small sack of pearls carved into decorative beads, gone missing from the stores of Frozenfar Expeditions

If the characters inquire about a reward for dealing with the thieves, Trovus explains that the town doesn't have the coin to pay someone to investigate the matter. Most of the valuables in the village have disappeared already, so there's little left to use as compensation. 

### Helpful Sisters

Trovus leads the characters through Caer-Konig to the Northern Light on the eastern edge of town. An empty hook, meant to carry a lantern, hangs above the inn's entrance.

>>The inn appears to be mostly empty. A young woman looks up as you enter, gives Trovus a chastising smile, and says, "Did you fall asleep outside again? I'm telling you, Trovus, one day you're going to have to stop relying on the kindness of strangers."
>>
>>The woman then opens a door into what looks like a kitchen and calls out, "Heat up something for Trovus. He's been out 'patrolling' again."
>>

The woman, Allie, is one of the Shorard sisters (neutral good human **commoners**), who own the inn. The other owner, Cori, is working in the kitchen. Allie settles Trovus into a chair before approaching the characters.

She confirms that the town has been experiencing break-ins and robberies lately, but no one has witnessed a potential culprit. The only clue is a set of tracks leading in the direction of Kelvin's Cairn. Allie thinks the tracks were made by dwarves who live in the valley at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. She suspects that the endless winter has made the dwarves desperate for food and ale, though she can't explain why the dwarves would steal the inn's lantern and other valuables. Allie is also surprised that no one in Caer-Konig has seen or heard the dwarves, remarking that "A quiet dwarf is an oxymoron."

Any interaction with Allie is interrupted when Cori exits the kitchen:

>>The door to the kitchen swings open as a stern-looking woman enters holding a steaming bowl of soup. She places the bowl down in front of Trovus and says, "No dwarf did this. Someone would have spotted 'em. Caught 'em. No, there's something more going on. Besides, what use do hungry dwarves have for a lantern?"
>>

If the characters ask Cori for details, she explains that the magic lantern that used to decorate the outside of their inn doesn't do anything useful other than light up the area with different colors.

If asked about a reward for dealing with the thieves, the sisters say they have little coin, but they can provide food and comfortable beds in exchange for the party's help. They'll even throw in a few flagons of beer if the characters can bring their magic lantern back to the inn.

If the characters accept the quest, Allie takes them to the back of the inn, where faint footprints lead toward Kelvin's Cairn. If they refuse the quest, Caer-Konig continues to be tormented by invisible thieves until the duergar stop searching the town for chardalyn.

#### Getting a Dogsled

If the characters are interested in following the suspicious tracks, the Shorard sisters suggest they visit Frozenfar Expeditions and secure a dogsled before setting out on their adventure. If the characters do so, they discover that Jarthra, the mountain guide at Frozenfar Expeditions, is willing to accompany the characters for a small fee of 10 gp per day of travel. Jarthra has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made in the vicinity of Kelvin's Cairn.

### Following the Tracks

The tracks leading away from the inn have been partly filled with blowing snow, making them appear as small depressions. Once the characters get about 50 feet away from the inn and its outbuildings, they discover that the tracks have been completely obscured.

If the characters wait until morning to set out, they find a set of fresh footprints left behind by a lone duergar scout. This duergar didn't enter any buildings, but simply looked around the village before leaving close to morning. Following the footprints leads to a different set of tracks, which were made by an ogre zombie pulling a dogsled. These new tracks begin where the duergar tracks end, a quarter-mile outside of town. (The ogre zombie waited all night for the duergar to return. The duergar hopped onto the dogsled before ordering the ogre zombie to march.) Any character who examines these tracks and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies the creature tracks as belonging to an ogre. The characters can follow these fresh tracks, which head toward the mountain and then veer toward the duergar outpost hidden in the northeastern foothills of Kelvin's Cairn.

Once the characters get within a mile of the outpost, they discover that the wind has erased the tracks they've been following, making it difficult for them to find the exact destination. For every hour the characters spend searching the foothills, have them make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) group check. Jarthra contributes to this group check, if she's present, and has advantage on her roll. If the group check succeeds, the characters find the outpost. If the group check fails, they didn't find the outpost during that hour but can try again. If they fail two of these group checks in a row, the characters have a random encounter in the wilderness, possibly during a blizzard (see "Wilderness Encounters").

### Approaching the Outpost

The duergar outpost, a recent addition to the foothills north of Kelvin's Cairn, was carved out of a hillside. Although the duergar are based mainly in Xardorok's mountain fortress (described in chapter 3), they come to this outpost to resupply and rest before searching nearby settlements for chardalyn.

When the characters find the duergar outpost, read:

>>A blocky stronghold bereft of warmth or charm juts out of a hillside in a rough crescent shape. Only part of its construction is visible; the rest is buried in the stone.
>>
>>A large double door of stone serves as the main entrance. The terrain leading to it is a gently upward-sloping plain covered with fresh snow. A stream used to flow out of a barred culvert northeast of the main entrance, but the waterway has frozen. Two other barred openings can be seen along the stronghold's northern wall. Anyone positioned behind these openings would have an unobstructed view of the hillside.
>>
>>Closer to you, separated from the rest of the stronghold, is a snow-covered stone bunker perforated by arrow slits.
>>

Two duergar watch for approaching intruders. One is stationed in the bunker (area O1), the other in the overlook (area O3). These duergar are tired and bored, but they notice characters who are so incautious as to carry light sources or otherwise announce their presence.

If the overlook duergar sees what she perceives to be a threat, she sounds the alarm as she runs down to the main entrance (area O2) to pull up the drawbridge, taking 2 rounds to do so. The duergar in the bunker is armed with a heavy crossbow (1d10 piercing damage) and takes pot shots at visible threats.

Characters who succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check can approach the stronghold undetected by hugging the north cliff and moving behind the bunker and below the openings of the overlook. Once they reach the mouth of the frozen river, they can crawl through the culvert (which leads under area O2) or quietly approach the main entrance without being detected.

> ##### Roleplaying the Duergar
>
>When the characters arrive, the outpost contains five **duergar** (including Nildar), who behave as described here.
>
>Before entering combat, these duergar use their Enlarge trait to increase their size. If a duergar is caught alone by a group of foes, it calls out for help before turning invisible. When backup arrives, it uses its Enlarge and rejoins the fight.
>
>These duergar won't negotiate, and they refuse to surrender. If the characters capture and interrogate a duergar, a successful DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation) check can convince the prisoner to divulge the following information:
>
>- Nildar Sunblight commands the outpost.
>- Nildar is searching Ten-Towns for chardalyn on behalf of his father, **Xardorok Sunblight**, who commands a much larger fortress in the mountains. Xardorok is obsessed with chardalyn and is forging a dragon out of it.
>- The outpost was built close to Kelvin's Cairn for a reason. Once Ten-Towns is destroyed, the duergar plan to use this outpost as a staging area for a raid against the mines in the Dwarven Valley.

### Outpost Locations

The duergar outpost was not built with the intention of being aesthetically pleasing or welcoming to strangers. There is no interior lighting, since the duergar rely on darkvision to see. The walls and entryways are all 10 feet high, allowing duergar that have grown to Large size to move around easily.

![Map 1.6: Duergar Outpost](img/adventure/IDRotF/035-map-1.6-duergar-outpost.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/036-map-1.6-duergar-outpost-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.6.

#### O1. Bunker

>>This stone bunker stands fifteen feet tall. The rough edges of its construction indicate that it was cut from a single piece of stone.
>>

A **duergar** named Brojk stands guard in the bunker and shoots his heavy crossbow through the arrow slits at any creatures he sees. He carries this crossbow in addition to his regular weapons.

***Underground Tunnel.*** This 5-foot-high tunnel is 20 feet underground and has a 20-foot-long ladder at each end. The ladder at the north end leads up to area O4.

#### O2. Main Keep

The outer doors aren't locked, but they are heavy. As an action, a character can pull the doors open by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. A 30-foot-deep pit just inside these doors is spanned by a 20-foot-square wooden drawbridge that can be raised by a simple pull-chain mechanism in times of danger.

>>This hall is devoid of decoration. A frozen well stands hear a hallway to the east, and three iron cages are pushed against one wall. One contains a malodorous ogre with rotting, half-frozen skin and an empty right eye socket. It howls in despair at the sight of you. Another cage holds a pair of nervous goats. The third cage is empty. Leaning against a wall near the cages is a wooden dogsled with ice clinging to it.
>>

The two **goats** were stolen from Caer-Konig, and the duergar plan to eat them. The duergar use the **ogre zombie** to pull their dogsled. The zombie has been enslaved and browbeaten by the duergar and does as they command. Inside its cage, it can do no harm to anyone.

If they haven't already done so, the duergar from the bunker (area O1) and the overlook (area O3) run down to release the ogre zombie from its cage and attack intruders who breach this hall. The zombie sides with the duergar in any fight. Duergar that fall below half their hit points move behind the chokepoint (area O5), leaving the ogre zombie to cover their retreat if it comes to that.

***Well.*** The well descends 10 feet to an underground cistern. The sides of the well are icy and require climbing gear or magic to scale.

#### O3. Overlook

>>The door opens into a large, nearly empty room. Snow has drifted into the corners, and frost covers the stone walls. Three barred openings overlook the snow-covered grounds outside the stronghold.
>>

Unless she has cause to leave the overlook and raise the drawbridge in area O2, a **duergar** named Urthhild stands guard here, stamping her feet to fight off the cold.

***Barred Openings.*** Vertical iron bars spaced 6 inches apart are embedded in the stone frames of three 5-foot-tall rectangular openings. As an action, a character can try to bend the bars to create an opening big enough for a Small creature to squeeze through, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### O4. Armory

>>Piles of equipment are pushed against the walls of this room. In the southern end of the chamber, an open hatch reveals a route leading underground.
>>

The armory holds equipment used by the duergar, including two suits of scale mail sized for dwarves, two steel shields, three war picks, nine javelins, two climber's kits, and four mess kits.

***Underground Tunnel.*** This 5-foot-high tunnel is 20 feet underground and has a 20-foot-long ladder at each end. The ladder at the south end climbs to area O1.

#### O5. Chokepoint

>>A long room, divided in the middle by two open doorways, stands empty. In the far southwest corner, an iron lever sticks out of the wall.
>>

Nildar (see area O6) investigates any loud noises in this area. Once summoned, he stands next to the lever and waits for one or more intruders to move into the chokepoint, whereupon he moves the lever to trigger a trap.

***Trap.*** When the lever is pulled, iron spikes spring out from the floor and ceiling to form barriers across each doorway. A creature in either opening must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) piercing damage from the spikes and be restrained until the spikes are retracted or the barrier is destroyed. The spikes can be retracted only by pulling the lever a second time.

This trap is designed to isolate a single enemy in the western part of the room, blocking it from its allies with the spikes. Creatures can see through the gaps between the spikes, but the gaps aren't big enough for a character to slip through. The barriers of spikes grant three-quarters cover to creatures behind them. Each barrier has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### O6. Commander's Quarters

>>A stone-carved bed and desk occupy this drab room. Atop the desk are several shards of dark crystal, as well as a crumpled-up piece of paper and a burlap sack draped over a glowing object that emits colored light that shifts from blue to green to red.
>>

If the characters made it through area O5 without getting into a fight, they catch Nildar Sunblight, a **duergar**, seated at the desk, studying his collection of glassy shards. He attacks the characters when they enter.

The glowing object on the desk is a magic lantern, which Nildar has covered with a burlap sack to dull its light. The lantern is the one that was stolen from the Northern Light in Caer-Konig. It shifts in color from blue to green to red but has no other magical properties.

The crumpled-up piece of paper on the desk bears a message from Nildar's older brother, Durth, written in charcoal and in Dwarvish. The letter reads as follows:

>>Brother,
>>
>>You will find me on the frozen ferry in Easthaven. From this new base, the search for chardalyn continues. Long may our father reign over this dark land!
>>
>>Durth
>>

![Nildar Sunblight](img/adventure/IDRotF/037-01-018.nildar.webp)

The characters can visit the ferry or give Durth's letter to the authorities in Easthaven and let them deal with him (see "*Easthaven*," for more information).

***Roleplaying Nildar.*** Nildar's main goal is to please his father, whose obsession with chardalyn he shares. When he's not leading raids, Nildar spends most of his time examining goods stolen from Caer-Konig and elsewhere. The shards on the table include several pieces of ordinary tinted glass and three dagger-sized pieces of chardalyn (see "*Chardalyn*"). With a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character can determine that the chardalyn, despite its crystalline composition, is malleable, making it an ideal raw material for those who can fashion items from the substance. No other properties can be discerned with an ability check. These chardalyn fragments contain no magic and are safe to handle.

***Defeating Nildar.*** If the characters capture Nildar and try to talk to him, he snarls and threatens the characters in Dwarvish:

>>"My father is more powerful than any of you filthy creatures could imagine. You don't understand the glory of it, the power found in the ice. None of you do. But you will learn soon enough when my father unleashes his terror upon Ten-Towns! Your doom soars on dragon's wings!"
>>

If the characters let Nildar go or if he escapes, he leaves the outpost using the ogre zombie and dogsled in area O2; if that's no longer an option, he flees on foot. He returns to his father's fortress in the mountains (see *chapter 3*), swearing revenge on the characters and vowing to inflict great pain on them if their paths cross again.

***Treasure.*** Characters who toss the room find a small coin purse stuffed into Nildar's bedroll. The purse contains 24 gp and 17 sp.

#### O7. Spore Servants

>>This chamber appears to be a cellblock lined with stone doors that have small, barred windows set into them at dwarf's-eye height. Snow and wind enter the room through a barred window in the northeast corner that looks out toward the snow-covered bunker that guards the main entrance.
>>

The barred opening in the northeast corner is similar to the ones in area O3.

The three cells along the west wall are empty at present. Each of the five cells along the south wall holds one prisoner, formerly a Ten-Towner or a Reghed nomad who was abducted and killed by the duergar. Using the animating spores of a myconid sovereign, the duergar have turned these dead humans into five spore servants (as described in the "Myconids" entry in the *Monster Manual*) covered with fungal growths. The spore servants emerge from their cells to attack intruders who enter the room. They use the **tribal warrior** stat block, with these changes:

- The spore servants are unaligned plants with a walking speed of 20 feet. They have blindsight out to a range of 30 feet and are blind beyond this radius. They can't be blinded, charmed, frightened, or paralyzed.
- They have an Intelligence of 2 (Ã¢ÂÂ4), a Wisdom of 6 (Ã¢ÂÂ2), and a Charisma of 1 (Ã¢ÂÂ5).
- They lose the Pack Tactics trait and all languages they once knew.

#### O8. Duergar Quarters

>>Small rooms flank a central common area where crates and sacks are stashed against the west wall. The doors of the two southern rooms are open, and each room is empty except for a tattered bedroll and a chair. From behind the closed doors of the northern rooms, you hear the faint sound of snoring.
>>

Each of the northern rooms has one **duergar** sleeping in it. The two duergar are brothers named Ruvik and Skorn. If the characters move around without making any loud noises, the duergar stay asleep. If awakened, they attack the intruders. The duergar sleep in their armor, keeping their shields and weapons within reach.

***Treasure.*** The crates and most of the sacks contain basic supplies, including blankets, rations, hempen rope, and other equipment. One small sack holds the stolen valuables from Caer-Konig: twenty-five pearls carved into decorative beads (5 gp each). Another sack contains three *daggers*, a set of *woodcarver's tools*, a set of *navigator's tools*, *fishing tackle*, and a *potion of healing* hidden in a leather pouch along with 73 sp.

### Concluding the Quest

When the characters return to the Northern Light, they find Trovus passed out in a padded armchair while Allie and Cori go about their work. If the characters tell Allie about the duergar outpost, she admits to knowing nothing about duergar and is disturbed to learn that they can turn invisible and grow themselves to ogre size!

If the characters retrieved the inn's lantern, Allie offers them a few flagons of ale as a reward. She has prepared rooms for them, even if they didn't bring back the lantern. Allie can also help the characters return other stolen goods to their proper owners in Caer-Konig.

# Dougan's Hole

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/038-01-019.shield-dougan.webp)

Dougan's Hole is the smallest and most insular of the ten towns. Its residents aren't fond of visitors, and inbreeding has caused the population to dwindle in recent years. It also has given rise to often-seen physical deformities, including but not limited to small, misshapen ears and slightly pointed teeth.

The town is a small cluster of dwellings perched on the edge of Redwaters that is too small to support any industryÃ¢ÂÂnot even scrimshaw. Ice has buckled the shorter of its two piers, rendering the dock unsafe. The longer pier has two icebound keelboats tethered to it, though they're immobile because Auril's winter has frozen the surface of the lake for hundreds of yards around them. Local fishers have hauled their smaller boats onto the shore and resorted to cutting holes in the ice to catch knucklehead trout, which they depend on for survival. Visitors to Dougan's Hole are often struck by the eeriness of dark, humanoid shapes out on the ice, remaining silent and still as the wind howls around them.

## Overland Travel

A six-mile-long, snow-covered path connects Dougan's Hole to the neighboring town of Good Mead. Characters on foot can walk this path in 4 hours; mounts and dogsleds can shorten this time by as much as 50 percent.

## Location in Dougan's Hole

The following location marked on map 1.7 can't help but attract the attention of new arrivals.

![Map 1.7: Dougan's Hole](img/adventure/IDRotF/039-map-1.7-dougan.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/040-map-1.7-dougan-player.webp)
### Twenty Stones of Thruun

*Triangle of megaliths*

The only truly interesting feature in Dougan's Hole is the ring of megaliths known as the Twenty Stones of Thruun. Standing at the southern edge of town, nineteen of these crudely fashioned granite menhirs are arranged in a rough triangle, with a single stone at the formation's center. No one knows who built this structure or why; the townsfolk maintain that the stones were there when the town's founder, a Chondathan named Dougan Dubrace, first happened upon this fishing spot. Scholars have tried to research the origin of the structure's name, but all they have found are allusions to a creature named Thruun in the oldest legends of the northern folk. Some speculate that Thruun was a god, while others believe it's a destructive elemental spirit bound to this location by ancient druidic magic.

## Holed Up

Two **winter wolves** are extorting the people of Dougan's Hole for food and treasure on behalf of a woolly **mammoth** named Norsu. Years ago, a frost druid cast an *awaken* spell on the mammoth. Last year, a group of adventurers killed Garagai, the mammoth's frost giant master. Norsu has never recovered from the loss and, to this day, watches over its master's frozen corpse, unwilling to leave its side. The winter wolves, who served Garagai as faithful friends, look after the mammoth. Although Norsu feeds on plants, not meat, it delights in killing humanoids to avenge Garagai's death. Slaying the mammoth is a tall order, so characters would be wise to flee from Norsu or try to reason with it.

Norsu and the winter wolves reside in an ice lodge built by Garagai. The wolves try to entice the characters into the lodge, knowing that Norsu will enjoy the exercise of killing them. Held captive in the lodge are Silja and Finn Dejarr, two teenaged siblings from Dougan's Hole who have been missing for the past four days and are presumed dead. The wolves are holding the siblings in a cage and feeding them raw meat to keep them alive until Dougan's Hole pays a ransom for their safe return. Characters lured to the ice lodge by the wolves or hired by Speaker Durmoot to find the missing teenagers can try to rescue Silja and Finn from the frost giant's lodge and see them safely back to town.

### Getting the Quest

If Dougan's Hole is the starting town for this adventure, the characters already know some of what's going on. Read:

>>Dougan's Hole is beset by winter wolves that stalk the outskirts of town.
>>
>>"Don't know how many, but them wolves are big as horses!" says a local with small, misshapen ears.
>>
>>"They know words an' got a mighty vocab'lary!" says another with pointed teeth.
>>
>>"By Thruun's Stones, they caught fair Sil and her lovely brother Finn th' other day," says a third, who bears more than a passing resemblance to the other two.
>>
>>A fourth who looks like their sister chimes in. "Dang winter wolves say they ain't givin' 'em back till the town coughs up a king's ransom in food and gold. This town barely got enough to feed its own, and there ain't no gold. Ain't no one allowed to leave town. Dem wolves vow to kill anyone who tries!"
>>

The townsfolk urge characters to meet with Speaker Edgra Durmoot before trying to help the town with its wolf problem. Speaker Durmoot is stubborn to a fault. She firmly believes that the missing teenagers are dead, and she's not about to give food to the winter wolves when her own people barely have enough to feed themselves. She lets the characters deal with the winter wolves as they see fit but offers no assistance.

![The winter wolf brothers, Koran and Kanan, pose a threat to all who visit Dougan's Hole](img/adventure/IDRotF/041-01-020.winter-wolf.webp)

### Good Wolf, Bad Wolf

When the characters first approach the outskirts of Dougan's Hole or shortly after they first leave town, they encounter two **winter wolves** named Koran and Kanan. Here's how the encounter plays out:

- Koran acts as the "good" wolf while his brother plays the "bad" wolf. This act has worked before on the dim-witted locals; the wolves assume the characters will be fooled just as easily.
- Koran approaches the characters, limping on one back leg and whimpering like a pitiful dog, making himself as unthreatening as possible. Kanan remains nearby but out of sight. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check sees through Koran's ruse, noticing how the wolf sometimes forgets which leg he's supposedly limping on.
- Koran claims that he was routinely kicked by his master, a mean old frost giant named Garagai. Koran also says that Garagai kidnapped two townsfolk and is holding them prisoner in his lodge more than half a day's walk west of town. Koran wants to help the characters free the prisoners, to get back at Garagai for his abuse. If the characters believe this story, Koran leads them to the lodge while Kanan follows their tracks and their scent, remaining out of sight.
- If Koran is unable to convince the characters to follow it back to the frost giant's lodge, Kanan steps in and plays the "bad" wolf, baring his fangs and threatening to eat the characters unless they change their minds. Kanan pretends to be upset about the abuse Garagai inflicted on Koran. "He'll think twice before he hurts one of us again," Kanan says with a growl. As earlier, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check allows a character to ascertain that the wolf is lying.

If the wolves can't trick or scare the characters into accompanying them to the frost giant's lodge thirteen miles west of Dougan's Hole, they drop their act and try to appeal to the characters' consciences. "It's awfully cold in that lodge," says Koran, to which his brother adds, "They won't suffer much longer. It's only a matter of time before Garagai skins and eats them." The wolves then bolt away, heading toward the lodge and leaving tracks that the characters can follow, if they choose not to accompany the wolves.

### Crossing the Tundra

The wilderness around Dougan's Hole is a frozen tundra. Snow falls frequently, adding to the snowpack and erasing tracks. There is a 50 percent chance that the characters get caught in a blizzard on the way to the lodge (see "Blizzards"). If Kanan and Koran are with the party, they protect the characters from the worst of the storm, using their bodies to shield the characters until it passes. The wolves' presence also prevents the characters from getting lost or separated.

Also crossing the tundra are a pack of 1d6 + 1 **wolves**, prowling the white in search of food. Characters who make a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check note that the wolves are gaunt from starvation. If the winter wolves are with the party, Kanan and Koran growl and bare their teeth, which deters the pack from approaching closer.

![Terror lurks in the icy depths of this frost giant lodge](img/adventure/IDRotF/042-01-021.webp)

### Approaching the Lodge

When the characters approach the lodge, read:

>>Jutting up out of the vast tundra is a towering edifice built entirely of ice. The domed structure is easily three times the height and width of any building found in Ten-Towns.
>>

The lodge has three tall openings on the east side. On the southern side of the building is a tunnel left behind by a remorhaz that raided the lodge's food stores. Characters spot this tunnel if they circle the lodge looking for other entrances.

If Koran and Kanan are with the characters or have arrived ahead of them, the two winter wolves sniff the air and inform the characters that Garagai isn't home. The wolves offer to stand guard outside while the characters enter the lodge and free the prisoners. Characters who suspect treachery can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check, tell that the wolves are lying about GaragaiÃ¢ÂÂthe frost giant is in fact inside the lodge. Are they afraid to face their master, perhaps, or is there another reason why the wolves won't enter the lodge? No ability check can answer this question; the characters must find out for themselves! In truth, the winter wolves expect Norsu to slaughter the characters, but in case that doesn't happen, they remain outside to attack any characters who try to flee. (Specifically, the wolves wait in area L1, east of the lodge's main entrance.) If one wolf is slain, the other flees to avoid a similar fate.

### Lodge Locations

The ice lodge was where Garagai lived and entertained other frost giants. Although not a jarl, Garagai held a respected position among the frost giants of the Far North. Everything in the lodge is built for giants and therefore quite large. The ceilings inside soar to a height of 30 feet.

![Map 1.8: Frost Giant Ice Lodge](img/adventure/IDRotF/043-map-1.8-frost-giant.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/044-map-1.8-frost-giant-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.8.

#### L1. Exterior

The characters approach the lodge from the east and have three entrances to choose from. These entrances lead to areas L2, L3, and L4, respectively. If the winter wolves are present, they gently nudge the characters toward the tunnel leading to area L4.

#### L2. Flensing Chamber

>>A sour stench of decay fills your nostrils. Lying on the ice-packed ground is the frozen corpse of a whale, crudely butchered. Beside it is a blade in the shape of a paring knife the size of a longsword.
>>

Garagai used this room to carve up whales and harvest their oil.

***Treasure.*** An alcove west of the carcass contains a 6-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, 5-foot-tall stone chest half buried under ice. A character must spend 1 hour chipping away the ice before the chest can be opened. It contains more giant-sized tools used for flensing, as well as a scrimshaw goat small enough to fit in a character's hand. The scrimshaw goat is worth 25 gp.

#### L3. Caged Townsfolk

>>A huge, slatted animal cage, with a locked gate attached to it by rusty hinges, stands against the west wall of this chamber. Trapped inside the cage are two shivering humans in cold weather clothing. They look fearfully at you.
>>

Garagai built the cage to hold Norsu when the mammoth was younger. Now it holds Silja and Finn Dejarr (neutral good human **commoners**), who are described below:

- Silja is a spindly girl with pointy teeth. Snow clings to the ends of her long braids. She is ready to do whatever it takes to get back to her mother in Dougan's Hole. Of the two siblings, she is the more proactive.
- Finn has a piebald face flanked by small, malformed ears. He is examining the brackets that hold together the slats of the cage to find a way to break them. His hands are frostbitten, and his teeth chatter uncontrollably.

The cage's metal slats are widely spaced, but not enough for the teenagers to slip between them. The slats are made of metal, and the cold makes them hard to manipulate. Applying heat to the slats makes them pliable, whereupon a character can use an action to try to pull two of the slats farther apart so that the slender Silja and Finn can slip through, accomplishing this feat with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

The lock on the cage's gate can be picked by a character using thieves' tools. An attempt takes 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check. Opening the gate causes its large, rusty hinges to squeal loudly unless a flask of oil is used to lubricate them first. If Norsu is still alive, the mammoth hears the squealing and makes its way from area L5 to this area, determined to kill interlopers on sight.

#### L4. Entrance Corridor

>>This passageway is choked with ice. Above you, icicles are densely clustered, their points sharp as daggers.
>>

A character can move through the ice-choked tunnel quietly by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, the noise alerts the mammoth in area L5.

#### L5. Garagai's Icy Tomb

>>This oval chamber with high walls of glittering ice resembles a sepulcher. The frozen, hacked-up corpse of a frost giant lies on the floor, entombed in translucent ice, and looming next to it is a woolly mammoth.
>>
>>Not far from the mammoth, carved from a single block of ice, is a giant-sized throne atop a circular dais. Chiseled into the throne's backrest is a large rune.
>>

If the awakened **mammoth** is aware of the characters' presence, add:

>>The mammoth stares down at you with hate in its eyes. "You are to blame for all of this!" It then lowers its head and assumes a threatening posture.
>>

This chamber is where Garagai would lounge with Norsu at his side and greet visiting frost giants. Cursed with sentience, the awakened neutral evil mammoth grieves for its dead master. It has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common.

To Norsu, the characters' mere presence desecrates Garagai's tomb, and the mammoth reacts by trying to gore them with its tusks and crush them underfoot. Any character who can act before Norsu takes its first turn in combat can use an action to attempt to calm the mammoth before it attacks. A character who claims to be Garagai's friend can calm the mammoth with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check, while a character who vows to avenge Garagai's death can calm the mammoth with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If calmed, Norsu allows characters to honor Garagai by performing a prayer over his frozen corpse or leaving a gift, but otherwise expects the characters to withdraw from its presence so it can mourn in private. If the characters fail to calm Norsu or flee from it, the mammoth charges after them. Overcome by inconsolable rage, it pursues prey beyond the confines of the lodge but doesn't go farther than 100 feet before turning back and rejoining its dead master.

The adventurers who slew Garagai took his greataxe as a trophy as well as his other personal possessions, leaving nothing of value on the hacked-up corpse.

***Ice Throne.*** The symbol carved into the throne is the Giant rune for "ice," as any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can ascertain. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the rune, which empowers the throne. A creature that sits in the throne becomes aware of its magical nature and can use an action while seated in the throne to summon a blizzard, which takes 1 minute to form. The blizzard engulfs the lodge, extends 1 mile from it in all directions, and lasts for 8 hours. This property of the throne recharges after a tenday.

If the ice throne is destroyed, it ceases to be magical. The throne has AC 13; 80 hit points; resistance to piercing and slashing damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage; and vulnerability to fire damage.

#### L6. War Room

>>A massive table hewn from a single block of ice stands in the middle of this cold chamber, surrounded by chairs also made of ice. Many of the chairs are chipped and cracked.
>>

Garagai and other frost giants once gathered around the table to discuss various matters. Lying on the floor under the table is a 1-foot-tall stone statuette of a spindly creature that the characters recognize as the image of a **chwinga** (see *appendix C*) if they've seen one before. In fact, the statuette is an actual **chwinga** that turned to stone when it died. Its killers are still in the room, hiding behind chairs: three **Icewind kobolds** (see appendix C) named Holgi, Snorp, and Zilbo. They assumed the lodge was unoccupied and did not expect to find Norsu and the winter wolves dwelling inside. The **chwinga** startled them, so they killed it. When the characters enter this area, the kobolds cower behind chairs and petition the characters for help in escaping the lodge. If the characters oblige, the kobolds stay with the characters until they're outdoors, whereupon the kobolds either part company with their saviors or remain with the characters for food and protection (at your discretion).

#### L7. Garagai's Bedroll

>>The only furniture in this cavernous chamber is a big fur bedroll. The fur is matted and musty.
>>

Garagai used to sleep here. The room is now unoccupied.

#### L8. Whale Oil Storage

A remorhaz has burrowed a tunnel into this room. The tunnel runs underneath the southern wall, providing an alternate entrance into the lodge.

A foul scent pervades the room, which contains five barrels of whale oil. An intact barrel of whale oil weighs 500 pounds and can be sold in Ten-Towns for 50 gp.

***Treasure.*** The remorhaz is long gone, but characters who explore its tunnel find a strange, frosted white residue smeared across a 5-foot section of wallÃ¢ÂÂenough to fill a small bottle. This rare secretion is called thrym; remorhazes are known to exude small quantities of it shortly before they give birth. Alchemists use thrym to craft *potions of resistance (cold)* and other useful concoctions. A bottle of thrym sells for 250 gp. Any character who is proficient with alchemist's supplies can examine this residue and determine its true nature with a successful DC 11 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

### Sneaking Out

With Silja and Finn in tow, the characters can try to sneak out of the lodge. As long as they keep quiet and avoid the central chamber (area L5), they won't incur the wrath of the awakened mammoth. However, they must also deal with the two winter wolves lurking outside. The remorhaz tunnel in area L8 provides an alternate escape route, since the wolves aren't watching that exit.

The trip back to Dougan's Hole can be uneventful, or you can roll for a random encounter using the Wilderness Encounters rules (see "Wilderness Encounters"). If the winter wolves are still alive, they attack the party as soon as the random encounter ends, before the characters have a chance to rest. Killing one wolf triggers the self-preservation instinct in its brother, causing it to flee.

### Concluding the Quest

If they escape the lodge and survive the journey home, Silja and Finn are reunited with their mother, Hilda, who has been sick with worry but is overjoyed to see them alive.

#### Treasure

Hilda married her older brother, who was a hunter. He passed away a few years ago but left behind some magic boots he won from a wayward adventurer he bested in a drinking contest. If one or both of her children are returned safely, Hilda gives the characters her husband's *boots of the winterlands* as a thank-you.

# Easthaven

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/045-01-022.shield-easthaven.webp)

Walking into Easthaven is like stepping into Icewind Dale's pastÃ¢ÂÂthe place is a living example of the boomtown way of life that gripped all of Ten-Towns centuries ago. In the generations since, as other towns have settled into a predictable pattern of existence, Easthaven has continued to grow and reinvent itself. After the Eastway was paved, Easthaven evolved into a frontier traders' paradise, fueling the jealousy of its neighbors.

Easthaven's founders were thieves from the Duchy of Cape Velen, on a peninsula far to the south. They refused to kowtow to a powerful thieves' guild and were driven out. To this day, Easthaven honors its shady founders by declaring pickpocketing legal within the town limitsÃ¢ÂÂwhich explains the "Watch thy pouch!" signs posted in various local establishments.

Duergar have infiltrated the town of late, scouring Easthaven and the surrounding tundra for chardalyn fragments to bring back to their hidden mountain stronghold. The leader of these duergar is Durth Sunblight, the oldest living son of **Xardorok Sunblight**. Durth and his gang have turned the frozen Easthaven ferry into a temporary base. Using their innate invisibility to move about unseen, the duergar betray their presence only by the footprints they leave in the snow.

Another occurrence of note is the recent capture of a Red Wizard of Thay who has been found guilty of killing a handful of dale-folk he had hired for an expedition. Speaker Danneth Waylen has issued a decree that the wizard be tied to a stake and burned aliveÃ¢ÂÂan event that a lot of Easthaven residents are looking forward to.

***Available Quest.*** "Toil and Trouble".

- **Population.** 750.

***Leaders.*** Speaker Danneth Waylen (chaotic good human **commoner**), respected for his humility and forthrightness. Captain Imdra Arlaggath (lawful good half-elf **veteran**) commands the town's militia.

***Militia.*** Easthaven can muster up to 150 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 12 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** A snowflake at the top center of a steel-gray field, above a horizontal brown field that forms the left-hand base, and a dark blue field that forms the right-hand base; where they meet is a thin white tower. The brown field represents the Eastway, the tower represents the town, and the blue field is Lac Dinneshere.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Humanoid (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivals.** Caer-Dineval, Caer-Konig.

## Overland Travel

The Eastway stretches between Easthaven and Bryn Shander. Snow-covered paths branching off this road lead to Caer-Dineval and Good Mead. Travel times in the Overland Travel from Easthaven table assume that characters are on foot; mounts and dogsleds can shorten these times by as much as 50 percent.

##### Overland Travel from Easthaven
|      To      | Travel Time |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Bryn Shander |   7ÃÂ½ hours  |
| Caer-Dineval |   9 hours   |
|   Good Mead  |   4ÃÂ½ hours  |

## Locations in Easthaven

![Map 1.9: Easthaven](img/adventure/IDRotF/046-map-1.9-easthaven.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/047-map-1.9-easthaven-player.webp)The following locations, marked on map 1.9, are a few of the places the characters might visit during their time in Easthaven. Another important locationÃ¢ÂÂEasthaven's Town HallÃ¢ÂÂis described later, in the "Town Hall Capers" section.

### Easthaven Ferry

*Ferry service (halted*)

A letter found in a secret duergar outpost (see "The Unseen") might lead the characters to this location. Delivering the letter to Speaker Waylen or Captain Arlaggath prompts these NPCs to meet and determine an appropriate course of action. Together, they ask the characters to search the ferry and slay any duergar they encounter aboard it. If the characters request backup, Captain Arlaggath accompanies them.

Use the following boxed text to describe the ferry to the players:

>>Easthaven's ferry, a keelboat, is trapped in the ice at the end of a wooden dock. A small cabin is situated toward the aft end of the hull.
>>

When the lake isn't frozen, this keelboat transports people and cargo to the towns of Caer-Dineval and Caer-Konig for a modest fee. But the boat and much of Easthaven's harbor is trapped in ice, and Speaker Waylen has declared that ferry service must cease until the ice thawsÃ¢ÂÂwhich, given Auril's temperament, seems unlikely to happen soon. The ferry's tiefling owner and operator, Scython, spends his idle time at the Wet Trout (described below). In Scython's absence, the ferry has become a base of operations for a **duergar mind master** (see *appendix C*) named Durth Sunblight. He and three other **duergar** named Klaska, Ossyl, and Zublorr are using the ferry's aft cabin as a lair, but only Durth is present when the characters first arrive at the ferry. The other duergar are searching Easthaven for chardalyn.

The duergar are cautious enough to turn invisible while moving through town and on the docks, but not smart enough to cover the tracks they make in the snow. Characters who search for tracks on the snow-covered dock and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can discern 1d4 distinct sets of dwarven boot prints leading to and from the ferry. These tracks were made within the past 24 hours.

![Durth Sunblight](img/adventure/IDRotF/048-01-023.durth.webp)

#### Aft Cabin

The ice covering the cabin door has been chipped away, and the door is not locked. The space is roughly 10 feet square and contains four sleeping bags, packs of stolen rations, and a rolled-up map of Icewind Dale that marks the location of every Ten-Towns settlement, as well as the locations of the duergar outpost near Kelvin's Cairn (see "Outpost Locations") and Sunblight, the fortress hidden in the mountains (described in *chapter 3*). All of the place names on the map are written in Dwarvish.

Lurking in the cabin is Durth Sunblight. He knows when someone else boards the ship by the creaking of the deck. As a precaution, he turns invisible and stands in an empty corner at the back of the cabin. If an intruder detects him or tries to steal his map, he attacks. If he's reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he shrinks to Tiny size and flees through a 4-inch-diameter rathole, exiting outside the ship 5 feet above the frozen harbor and 5 feet away from the dock. If he escapes, Durth returns to his father's fortress in the mountains (see *chapter 3*), abandoning his duergar companions.

#### Development

Durth's companions have been scouring Easthaven for chardalyn. Their latest search has borne no fruit, and they return to the ferry 30 minutes after the characters board it. These three duergar attack any non-duergar they encounter onboard the vessel. If they find Durth's dead body or no signs of him at all aboard the ferry, they abandon the ship and don't return to it.

If the characters capture Durth, he warns his captors that he's the son of **Xardorok Sunblight**, who will soon claim Icewind Dale as his kingdom, and it would be unwise for them to earn the wrath of so powerful a figure. Durth doesn't give up any other information. His companions are similarly tight-lipped; however, threats to Durth's life or the clever use of a *suggestion* spell or similar magic can persuade one or more them to reveal the following additional information:

- Xardorok has a fortress hidden in the mountains. (The route to this fortress is marked on Durth's map aboard the ferry.)
- Xardorok's fortress has a forge powered by the still-beating heart of a red dragon. In this forge, Xardorok is crafting a dragon made of chardalyn, with which he plans to destroy Ten-Towns. The chardalyn dragon is close to being finished.
- Xardorok has another son, Nildar, who commands a secret outpost on the northeast side of Kelvin's Cairn (see "The Unseen").

### The Wet Trout

*Popular tavern*

The Wet Trout, located near the docks, is the largest and loudest tavern in Easthaven, known for its ribald atmosphere and rumor-mongering. A great chimney squarely in the building's center has hearths on either side to warm the tavern's two common rooms. The tavern's current owner and proprietor is Nymetra Myskyn, a chaotic neutral dragonborn **berserker** of white dragon ancestry. Although she can be crusty and full of complaints, Nymetra is not discouraged by the Everlasting Rime, which she regards as a test of Ten-Towns' mettle. An unapologetic worshiper of Auril, she supports Easthaven's attempts to appease the Frostmaiden with sacrifices (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

***Scython.*** One of the Wet Trout's regular patrons is Scython, a neutral good tiefling **bandit captain** who owns a small house a few blocks away. Scython is also the owner and operator of Easthaven's ferry. A talkative, happy-go-lucky fellow, he knows rumors that might interest the characters. Roll three times on the Ten-Towns Rumors table (see "Ten-Towns Rumors") to determine what Scython knows.

Although he's well informed, Scython doesn't know about the duergar stowing away aboard his ship (see "Easthaven Ferry" above).

### The White Lady Inn

*Inn*

This musty old inn is named after a local legend known as the White LadyÃ¢ÂÂa ghost rumored to walk on Lac Dinneshere, haunting the spot where her rich husband drowned. Rinaldo (lawful good strongheart halfling **commoner**), a self-styled bard kept around to entertain guests, is fond of plucking his fiddle while recounting his tale: that the White Lady's husband was a miser who kept his treasure in a heavy, locked chest that never left his side. Perhaps it was this heavy chest, suggests Rinaldo, that capsized his boat and sent the man to his sunken grave, or perhaps it was the fright of seeing his dead wife that caused him to capsize the boat and drown. Either way, Rinaldo is certain that the man's treasure lies at the bottom of the lake, waiting for some intrepid explorer to find it. The inn's sullen, elderly proprietor, Bartaban (neutral good human **commoner**), has heard the halfling's rambling far too often to be humored by it.

#### SÃÂ©ance

Rinaldo is planning to conduct a sÃÂ©ance in a back room of the inn and has invited half a dozen other guests (**commoners**) to join him. Characters who spend one or more nights at the inn are invited by Rinaldo to join his sÃÂ©ance. If the characters decline, Rinaldo is disappointed and tries to get them to change their minds by saying, "We live in dark times. Perhaps the spirit of the White Lady can help. Aren't you curious to hear what she has to say?"

If one or more characters are present when the sÃÂ©ance begins, read:

>>Smoke from burning incense clouds the room. Multicolored lamps and silks are hung from the rafters, and the light from several candles illuminates a circle of uncomfortable-looking guests sitting cross-legged on the floor.
>>
>>Rinaldo pushes back the sleeves of his robe, raises his hands, closes his eyes, and intones, "Lady who watches from the lake, come to us in our darkest hour! Tell us what you've seen!" After a moment of silence, thick frost forms on the inside of the room's windows, turning them opaque, and the candles go out one by one.
>>

Rinaldo senses that the White Lady's spirit is close and urges the characters to reach out to it. Ask the players in turn what their characters say or do. The characters who try to help Rinaldo must make a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) group check. If the group check fails, the White Lady's spirit manifests as a poltergeist and attacks the party, frightening away the other participants. This **poltergeist** uses the **specter** stat block, with the changes outlined in the "Variant: Poltergeist" sidebar that appears with it in the *Monster Manual*.

If the group check succeeds, Rinaldo can sense that the spirit is receptive and urges the characters to ask it questions. The spirit replies truthfully by tracing short, two- to five-word answers on the room's frosted windows. If doing that becomes too cumbersome, the spirit uses Rinaldo as a vessel to whisper the answers. If the spirit doesn't know an answer or thinks a question is foolish, it shatters a window instead. Once it answers three questions, the spirit departs, and Rinaldo can't try to summon it again until he finishes a long rest.

Here's what the White Lady knows about the recent happenings around Lac Dinneshere:

- The castle in Caer-Dineval has become a base for a devil-worshiping cult.
- Gray-skinned dwarves have been stalking the streets of Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig while invisible. Their intentions aren't good. They hide aboard the town ferry (see "Easthaven Ferry" above) and in the ruins of Dinev's Rest (see "Dinev's Rest").
- A magic cauldron is hidden in some frozen, lakeside caves. The cauldron is guarded by an evil hag named Maud Chiselbone and can conjure enough stew to feed a starving town indefinitely (see "Toil and Trouble" below).

The White Lady doesn't remember the details of her own death or the fate of her lost love. Once her spirit departs, the frost on the windows dissipates.

![Rinaldo the halfling leads a seance to contact the spirit of the White Lady of Lac Dinneshere](img/adventure/IDRotF/049-01-024.rinaldo.webp)

## Toil and Trouble

The quest in Easthaven begins at the same time as the burning of the Red Wizard, Dzaan, who is described in the "Arcane Brotherhood" section of appendix C. Whether the characters are starting the adventure in Easthaven or have just arrived, they are present during Dzaan's fiery execution. They're too late to save Dzaan, but they might encounter a magical copy of him again in chapter 2 (see "Lost Spire of Netheril").

The captain of Easthaven's militia, Imdra Arlaggath, takes notice of the characters during the burning and offers them a quest. Some fishers have gone missing on Lac Dinneshere, and she wants the characters to take a boat and search for them. She knows where the fishers like to fish and urges the characters to search that part of the lake first. If they heed Imdra's advice, they find the fishers' boats pulled up on the ice within short walking distance from a frozen cave previously hidden under snow and ice. This cave, the characters soon discover, is the lair of a hag named Maud Chiselbone.

Characters who explore the cave complex find the bodies of the fishers, as well as Maud's *cauldron of plenty* (see *appendix D*). The cauldron is a stunning discovery and a welcome one for the people of Ten-Towns, if the characters choose to part with it. If news of the cauldron spreads, the characters will quickly find themselves the center of attention as various towns strive to obtain it. With no end to winter in sight, the cauldron might be the last thing standing between one town's survival and another's extinction.

![Easthaven residents bask in the warmth of an evil wizard being burned at the stake](img/adventure/IDRotF/050-01-025.easthaven.webp)

### Public Execution

Events begin to unfold when the characters find themselves in the vicinity as Dzaan's execution takes place:

>>A crowd has gathered in front of the Town Hall to watch the public execution of Dzaan, a human wizard who, despite efforts to disguise himself, was recognized and arrested for the crimes he has inflicted upon dale-folk. He has been bound to a stake and gagged. Members of the militia use torches to light the straw tucked around his feet. Fanned by the wind, the fire catches quickly. Dzaan does not struggle or scream as he is quickly engulfed in flames. Bundled-up spectators move closer to the human bonfire, eager to feel its warmth.
>>

A woman bedecked in a tailored coat and a fur hat approaches the characters as people huddle around the burning wizard. She introduces herself as Imdra Arlaggath, captain of Easthaven's militia. Captain Arlaggath (lawful good half-elf **veteran**) speaks curtly but is not unfriendly. If any of the characters ask about Dzaan, she tells them that he coldly murdered some adventurers who had aided the people of Icewind Dale in the past; his public execution isn't an act of vengeance but is meant to deter others from engaging in similar behavior.

### Getting the Quest

Captain Arlaggath asks about the characters' hometowns and reasons for being in Easthaven before asking if they can assist in an investigation. If they express interest, she shares the following information:

>>"Four fishers went missing on Lac Dinneshere a tenday ago. The coastline is hard to sail along because of the ice floes, but savvy anglers prefer itÃ¢ÂÂthere are fewer competing fishers from the other lake towns there. We need someone to scout the coastline and search for them."
>>

If the characters need a boat, they can borrow one from the angler docks and drag it across the ice to the open water. A rowboat can hold up to four Medium characters, while a single-masted skiff can hold up to eight. A skiff requires at least one crew member who has proficiency with water vehicles.

If the characters request a reward for their services, Captain Arlaggath says she's not authorized to give one. But she did confiscate two items from Dzaan that might interest the characters: a *spell scroll* of *fireball* in a copper tube and a gray *bag of tricks*. They can have one or the other if they find the missing fishers.

### The Search Begins

Much of Lac Dinneshere is covered with ice. Only the hardiest anglers venture out to fish for knucklehead trout. To wrangle such a catch, fishers must drag their boats across the ice to open water and wait patiently out on the lake in the freezing cold for hours at a time. To fend off the chill, they often bring bottles of ale to keep warm. Imbibing too much is dangerous, for it makes the anglers more susceptible to being pulled overboard by stubborn knuckleheads. Too much ale also leads to foolhardy decisions. Such was the fate of four old anglers from Easthaven, who abandoned their trusty boat, *Bunch o' Knuckleheads*, to follow a tantalizing scent emanating from the mouth of a lakeside cave. Inside, they encountered a hag named Maud Chiselbone and a spicy concoction she prepared using her *cauldron of plenty*. Maud took the opportunity to season her stew with the ale-soaked anglers before adding their bones to her growing collection.

#### Abandoned Rowboat

The characters find the *Bunch o' Knuckleheads* along the coast:

>>A rowboat bobs untethered in the water amid some small ice floes, not far from the eighty-foot-high cliffs that abut the shoreline. The mouths of four caves dot the snowy cliffside. One of these caves is at water level, and the others are elevated twenty to thirty feet above the frozen lake. The wind tearing through these icy caves sounds like moaning.
>>

Characters who search the abandoned rowboat find four oars, four sets of fishing tackle, and a dozen empty bottles lying in it. Characters can also see faint tracks on the ice leading from the boat to the southernmost cave, which is where the four missing anglers went. The spicy scent that lured the fishers into the cave is not present when the characters arrive.

As the characters conclude their search of the rowboat and make their way toward the caves, two **harpies** fly over the coastline. Like many creatures in this region, the harpies are starving and eager for anything they can eat. If one is killed, the other flees.

### The Cauldron Caves

A cave network extends into the snow-swept cliffs along the shore of Lac Dinneshere. This complex once contained a sacred hot spring where elderly frost giants came to end their lives in a drowning ritual. Now, the waters have frozen over.

The caves have long been home to a lake hag named Maud Chiselbone. Maud has amassed a collection of bones and trinkets taken from wayward explorers who blundered into her lair. Maud once shared her caves with two sisters, but the coven had a falling out. The bones of Maud's dead sisters are among those on display in her home. Maud is always hungry and likes to lick clean the bones of her "guests." The four fishers from Easthaven are her latest victims.

#### Features of the Caves

The caves have the following recurring features:

- **Moaning Wind.** The howling wind that blows through the caves sounds like a moaning crone, which is bone-chilling enough to deter most would-be explorers. The wind blows out candles and other small flames but is otherwise harmless.

***Ice Everywhere.*** Slippery ice covers every wall, ceiling, and floor (see "*Slippery Ice*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). Characters with crampons strapped to their boots can traverse the ice without impediment.

- **High Ceilings.** The caves have 50-foot-high ceilings. The tunnels connecting the caves are 30 feet high.
- **Moonlight.** Infrequent, naturally occurring breaks in the ceiling allow moonlight into the caves, causing areas of the complex to be dimly lit on clear nights.

### Areas of the Cauldron Caves

![Map 1.10: Cauldron Caves](img/adventure/IDRotF/051-map-1.10-cauldron.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/052-map-1.10-cauldron-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.10.

#### U1. Cave Mouths

The characters must climb icy cliffs to reach the three northernmost caves, which are above water level. No ability check is required to do so, given the abundant handholds and footholds on the cliffs.

Water used to flow out of the southernmost tunnel and feed into the lake. That water is now frozen solid, creating a floor of ice several feet thick. The fishers entered the cave complex by this route, as evidenced by tracks in the snow that clings to the ice. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check, the characters can follow these four sets of human tracks as far as area U7, where they disappear. The fishers made it all the way to area U9, where they met their doom.

#### U2. Dire Wolf Den

A hungry **dire wolf** haunts this dark cave, the uneven floor of which is strewn with animal and humanoid bones. Unless the characters offer it fresh meat, the dire wolf attacks them. It's too mean-tempered to be befriended. The wolf has no trouble scrambling up or down the 20-foot-high wall at the mouth of its den.

#### U3. Cave Drawings

>>This cave has ancient, stick-figure drawings carved into its northern wall.
>>

A character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can correctly interpret the carvings, which show frost giants wading up a river to a cavern that contains a hot spring, in which they drown themselves.

#### U4. Moaning Cavern

The cave is empty except for three ice-covered pillars composed of mineral deposits.

#### U5. Icy Bridge

A natural stone bridge spans the frozen river 20 feet below. The top of the bridge is covered with a slippery, icy glaze. Crossing the bridge safely requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A creature that fails the check falls off the bridge and lands prone on the frozen river below, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

#### U6. Old Camp

>>This cave contains an abandoned campsite.
>>

Characters who search the charred remains of the campfire can find three torn-out pages, only partially burned, from a journal written in Dwarvish.

Written on the loose pages are an anonymous dwarf's musings about the cave complex. Characters who examine the pages find a couple of noteworthy passages:

- "These caves are sacred to the frost giants. The carvings on the wall suggest that the giants came here to drown themselves. Did they use the hot spring as a sacrificial pool?"
- "The wind truly sounds like a wailing woman. One could easily go mad in this place."
- "I think there's someone living in these caves. Shortly after discovering the hot spring, I heard what sounded like a granny singing. When the song ended with a shrill laugh, dread sunk its teeth in me. Ye gods, that horrible cackle! I shall leave these caves in the morning and never return."

#### U7. Waterfall

The river used to tumble over a small waterfall in this area, following the current west toward Lac Dinneshere. The waterfall now takes the form of a 10-foot-tall sheet of ice that can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. The ice is thin, however, and easily broken: the first creature of Medium size or larger to fail the check causes the ice to crack and fall, releasing a dormant **water weird**. After the ice breaks, enough ice remains that characters can still climb it, but the DC of the check increases to 15.

Lodged in the rocks behind the waterfall are items that were caught in the river, including an *explorer's pack* and a *miner's pick*. After the water weird is released and dealt with, these items can be safely recovered.

#### U8. Sacred Spring

An underground river once spilled into a pool in this area, filling it with steaming mineral water and overflowing to the west. The river and the pool are now frozen and will remain so until the Everlasting Rime ends.

On clear nights, moonlight shines through an opening in the ceiling and illuminates the pool. The minerals in the ice have turned it a cloudy, bright blue. Entombed in the ice are the remains of four frost giants, the faint outlines of their forms barely visible.

#### U9. Ossuary

This cave is higher in elevation than the tunnels leading to it, but it's easily reached by climbing one of two flights of crudely carved stairs.

On clear nights, moonlight enters the cave through natural fissures in the ceiling. Fresh blood paints the icy floor, indicating that one or more creatures were butchered here recently. (This is where the fishers from Easthaven met their end.) More obvious than the blood are all the bones: knucklehead trout spines, humanoid skeletons in pieces, and bones of small animals and birds, along with scraps of clothing and armor and a few rusty weapons.

Sitting among the bones in the middle of the cave is a **frost giant skeleton** (see *appendix C*) partially encased in ice. It remains inanimate until it takes damage or until an intruder enters the ossuary. Instead of rolling initiative for it, have it act on initiative count 1. The skeleton spends its first two turns in combat doing nothing other than breaking out of the ice and getting to its feet, which gives the characters time to flee or get in a few hits before the skeleton attacks.

This creature killed the fishers from Easthaven, and Maud is the only one who can control it. The skeleton tries to kill anyone else who enters this cave and pursues fleeing prey as far as it can without leaving the cave complex.

![Maud Chiselbone uses her magic cauldron to whip up a tasty human stew](img/adventure/IDRotF/053-01-026.maud.webp)

#### U10. Cauldron of Plenty

The lake hag, Maud Chiselbone (use the **sea hag** stat block), and her **will-o'-wisp** companion await characters in the middle of this cave. Maud stands between her *cauldron of plenty* (see *appendix D*) and a stone block atop which she butchers whatever meat is destined for her stew. Heaped around this block are rusty hatchets and the flayed corpses of the four fishers from Easthaven. The will-o'-wisp is normally invisible when its light is extinguished, but it brightens when it wants intruders to behold Maud's true, hideous form.

Maud disguises herself as a decrepit old woman. In this form, she wears tattered furs to stave off the cold. In her natural form, Maud has sickly grayish-purple flesh, bulging eyes that seldom blink, and stringy black hair interwoven with fingerbones. If her disguise is pierced or the characters threaten her, Maud summons the frost giant skeleton in area U9 to fight on her behalf, but it takes two rounds to arrive. If the skeleton is destroyed, Maud assumes her true form and takes on the characters herself. She won't give up her lair or the magic cauldron without a fight.

If she is reduced to 9 hit points or fewer, Maud tries to make a deal. She agrees to surrender the cauldron and promises to deliver a chest filled with gold coins that lies in the muck at the bottom of Lac Dinneshere. If the deal is struck and the characters release her as promised, Maud returns to the lake to make good on her end of the bargain. As she departs, she tells the characters to wait in the caves until midnight, then head north along the shore for a mile. If they follow her instructions, they find a waterlogged wooden chest on the icy shore, its lock broken off. See "Treasure" below for information on the chest's contents.

***Treasure.*** The piping-hot stew created by the *cauldron of plenty* is too bland for Maud's tastes, so she has added skinned meat and fresh human organs to the latest batch. Characters who examine the stew see lumps of flesh and organs floating in the spicy broth. Characters will need to dump the stew before trying to move the cauldron. Even empty, the cauldron requires some effort to transport, given its awkward size.

If the cauldron is hauled back to Ten-Towns and its magical properties become known, the characters won't have trouble finding an interested buyer for it (see "Concluding the Quest" and "Town Hall Capers" below).

The chest that Maud pulls from the depths of Lac Dinneshere contains 600 gp. Buried under the gold coins are four **crawling claws** that leap out and attack if the gold is removed, dumped, or otherwise disturbed.

### Concluding the Quest

Captain Arlaggath is saddened by the news that the missing fishers are dead, yet eager to hear a full account of the characters' visit to the Cauldron Caves.

#### Claiming the Reward

Having completed their quest, the characters are entitled to either the *spell scroll* of *fireball* or the gray *bag of tricks*, both of which Captain Arlaggath has in her custody.

#### Selling the Cauldron

Characters who try to sell the *cauldron of plenty* in Easthaven get more than they bargained for (see "Town Hall Capers" below).

## Town Hall Capers

Easthaven's Town Hall is the setting for two possible capers, one involving the theft of the *cauldron of plenty* and the other involving the theft of a ship's figurehead made of chardalyn. These capers occur under the following conditions:

- If the characters try to sell the *cauldron of plenty* in Easthaven, run "The Cauldron Caper."
- If the characters haven't dealt with the duergar threat aboard Easthaven's ferry and aren't likely to do so, run "The Chardalyn Caper."

You can run one caper or the other, or use both of them at different times in the adventure.

### The Cauldron Caper

If the characters bring the *cauldron of plenty* to Easthaven and its properties become known to Captain Arlaggath or other townsfolk, word gets around that the characters possess a magic item that could help feed the hungry in Ten-Towns. This news quickly reaches Speaker Danneth Waylen, who invites the characters to a private meeting at the Town Hall. During this meeting, Danneth tries to buy the cauldron, offering five 500 gp gemstones for it. No one else in Easthaven will pay more for it or bid against him.

Any character who barters with Danneth and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince him to sweeten the deal, in which case he offers up to ten 500 gp gemstones. If the characters accept his offer, Danneth needs 48 hours to call in some debts and acquire the gems, during which time he insists that the cauldron remain in Easthaven's Town Hall, under guard in area T17. The characters can either let four members of town militia (**tribal warriors**) watch over the cauldron, or they can protect it themselves. Danneth is satisfied either way.

![Speaker Danneth Waylen](img/adventure/IDRotF/054-01-027.danneth.webp)

#### Zhentarim Thieves

News of the cauldron reaches Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos within a day, thanks to a Zhentarim **spy** named Prudence Tarkwold, who works as a clerk in Easthaven's Town Hall and owns a small cottage nearby (where she keeps a **flying snake** that serves her as a messenger). After Prudence notifies him of the cauldron, Naerth sets into motion a plan to steal it. He dispatches three human **thugs** in cold weather clothing to meet with Prudence at the Town Hall as night falls. These thugs bring with them a domesticated **axe beak**, which they tie to a wooden post outside the Town Hall's north entrance.

Barring the characters' intervention, the Zhents corner Speaker Waylen in his office (area T3) and use him as a hostage to force the guards watching the cauldron to drop their weapons and surrender without a fight. After locking Speaker Waylen and the guards in the jail (area T18), the Zhents remove the cauldron from the Town Hall, lash it to the axe beak with rope, and toss the keys to the jail cells into a snowbank. The axe beak is strong enough to drag the cauldron through the snow behind it as the Zhents lead it back to Targos. The Zhents don't stop until the cauldron is delivered to Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr at the Luskan Arms (see "the Luskan Arms"). Any tracks they make in the snow are obliterated after 1d4 hours by blowing wind. Although they are lawful evil, the Zhents have strict orders not to kill anyone. Enemies they reduce to 0 hit points are knocked unconscious rather than slain.

#### Development

Characters at the Town Hall can attempt to thwart the robbery. If no characters are present during the robbery, the theft becomes apparent when the characters return to the Town Hall to close the deal with Speaker Waylen. If they arrive in the early hours of the morning, they hear loud banging coming from the dungeon, where the speaker and his guards are locked up. Otherwise, they arrive to find Captain Arlaggath and a small retinue of town guards trying to break open the cell doors.

Speaker Waylen is stung by Prudence's betrayal, as she worked closely with him for nearly three years. He had no idea she worked for the Zhentarim. If the characters don't know where the Zhents took the cauldron, Waylen recalls that Prudence offhandedly mentioned having family in Targos. (Her "family" is the Zhentarim.) He suggests they search for the cauldron there. Characters can find Prudence Tarkwold at the Luskan Arms, where she has a private room to herself. As for the cauldron, Speaker Maxildanarr has it and won't give it up without a fight.

### The Chardalyn Caper

The duergar hiding aboard the Easthaven ferry attack the Town Hall in the dead of night, determined to steal pieces of a ship's figurehead made of chardalyn. This theft occurs while most townsfolk, including Speaker Waylen, are asleep in their homes. For more information about the duergar and what they know, see the "Easthaven Ferry" section.

#### Duergar Thieves

If he's still alive, Durth Sunblight, a **duergar mind master** (see *appendix C*), leads three **duergar** named Klaska, Ossyl, and Zublorr to the Town Hall under the cover of night, making their way inside through the north entrance. Barring the characters' intervention, the duergar use their weapons to shatter the chardalyn figurehead in area T6. The guards in area T17 interrupt the duergar but are no match for them. After killing the guards with their war picks, the duergar finish breaking apart the figurehead.

Each duergar carries one sack that can hold up to five 20-pound fragments of chardalyn. After filling their sacks, the duergar exit the Town Hall and travel to their hidden fortress in the mountains (described in *chapter 3*). Any tracks left by the duergar are obliterated after 1d4 hours by blowing wind.

If too much time has passed to track the duergar, the characters have no way to know where they wentÃ¢ÂÂjust as well, given the perils of the duergar fortress. A search of the Easthaven ferry yields no clues, as the duergar took all their belongings (including Durth's map) with them.

#### Development

Unless they happen to be inside or near the Town Hall when the duergar arrive, the characters won't know about the theft until word reaches their ears the following day, when Speaker Waylen asks them to find the thieves and return the missing fragments of chardalyn, so that he can lock them up with the other pieces that the thieves left behind. Waylen is willing to pay 50 gp for each stolen fragment that is returned to him. If the characters aren't already aware of the properties of chardalyn, Waylen warns them about the demonic magic suffusing the crystal and urges them not to come in direct contact with any of the fragments.

Characters who are determined to find the stolen chardalyn fragments can question Easthaven's townsfolk to see if anyone saw suspicious activity on the night of the robbery. Any character who spends an hour knocking on doors and inquiring about town can make a DC 14 Charisma (Investigation) check at the end of that hour. On a failed check, no useful information is obtained. If the check succeeds, the character is urged to speak with Scython, the tiefling ferryman, who spends most of his free time in a tavern called the Wet Trout. Scython is widely regarded as a font of useful information. Although he doesn't know anything about the duergar or the stolen chardalyn, he knows several rumors that might steer the characters in new directions (see "The Wet Trout"). Once the characters are 4th level, the adventure steers them toward the duergar fortress in *chapter 3*, where the stolen chardalyn fragments can be found (see area X26).

### Easthaven Town Hall (T1-T10)

Information about Easthaven's Town Hall is provided here, along with a map. You can use map 1.11 to represent other town halls in Ten-Towns, as needed.

Easthaven's Town Hall is a two-story, wattle-and-daub building where townsfolk come to renew licenses, pay fines, settle petty claims, file complaints, and gather to discuss important issues. The flag of Easthaven flutters atop a cupola on the Town Hall's steeply pitched rooftop.

All above-ground levels have wooden floors, with framed oil paintings by local artists mounted above the wainscoting. The doors on these levels are made of sturdy wood and have no locks, though the outermost doors can be barred from within. The dungeon level is hewn out of solid rock and has sturdy iron doors throughout. Low-burning lanterns hang from iron brackets or the rafters, dimly lighting all interior locations.

![Map 1.11: Easthaven Town Hall](img/adventure/IDRotF/055-map-1.11-easthaven-town-hall.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/056-map-1.11-easthaven-town-hall-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.11.

#### T1. Reception Hall

>>This chamber is decorated with oil paintings depicting life in Easthaven, including a large painting of the town itself on the north wall. Mounted on the south wall is a five-foot-long, stuffed knucklehead trout. Its wooden plaque bears an engraved copper plate that reads, in Common, "Big Knuck, caught by Easthaven fishers during the summer of 1479 DR."
>>

A secret door in the northeast corner is partially concealed behind a tall, slender oil painting of fishing boats on Lac Dinneshere. It pulls open to reveal the speaker's office (area T3) beyond. Any character who searches the wall for secret doors finds it automatically.

#### T2. Administrative Office

This room contains rows of desks and filing cabinets. A few overstuffed lounge chairs are set aside for visitors.

#### T3. Speaker's Office

>>Tapestries and painted landscapes decorate this room, in the middle of which is a large table surrounded by high-backed wooden chairs.
>>

The speaker's chair has Easthaven's heraldry worked into its backrest, whereas the other chairs don't.

A secret door in the northwest corner is concealed behind a tapestry depicting a snow-capped mountain. It swings open into area T1. Any character who searches the wall for secret doors finds it automatically.

#### T4. Coat Closet

This is the speaker's personal coat closet. A full set of *cold weather clothing* is stored in the wooden trunk.

#### T5. Privy

This room contains a toilet, a bucket and mop, a simple wash basin, and a towel rack.

#### T6. Chardalyn Figurehead

Provided the duergar haven't destroyed it, a startling discovery awaits characters in this room:

>>Low-burning lanterns cast a gentle glow upon a tall, black object in the center of this room. Although one could easily mistake it for a statue, this object is actually the figurehead of a ship and is carved in the likeness of a winged demon. The demon-shaped figurehead stands eight feet tall. Shards of wood jut out of the demon's back at the points where the figurehead once attached to the hull of a ship.
>>

If the figurehead is intact and the characters participated in Rinaldo's sÃÂ©ance (see "SÃÂ©ance"), they see something else as well:

>>Lashed to the figurehead with rope is a scrawny woman who is dripping wet. Her long, white hair hangs over her face, obscuring it.
>>

Other features of the room include a wooden staircase that climbs to a balcony, mounted atop which is a small crane with a manual winch, and a staircase that leads down to the dungeon (see area T16).

***Demonic Figurehead.*** Characters familiar with chardalyn can tell that the figurehead is made of the substance. Those who succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (History) check realize that the figurehead depicts Errtu, a balor demon that terrorized Icewind Dale over a century ago. Characters who grew up in Icewind Dale have advantage on this check. The figurehead is a Large object with AC 13, a damage threshold of 5, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It weighs 1,000 pounds.

A band of adventurers used a *telekinesis* spell to raise the figurehead from the depths of Lac Dinneshere a few months ago and hauled it to Easthaven, hoping for a reward. What they got was hardly worth the effort, and Speaker Waylen doesn't know what else to do with the figurehead except store it here, out of the public eye. He fears the figurehead is tainted by demonic magic and has warned his staff not to touch it. A *detect evil and good* spell or similar magic reveals that it's a desecrated object. Any creature that comes into contact with it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or gain the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting personality trait: "I suspect most Ten-Towners are members of a secret cult devoted to the Frostmaiden." This paranoia can be ended on a creature by any spell that removes a curse. Prolonged contact with the figurehead might have other ill effects, at your discretion.

***White Lady of Lac Dinneshere.*** What looks like a woman tied to the figurehead is actually the White Lady of Lac Dinneshere, which manifests here as a chaotic evil **ghost**. If the characters keep their distance, the woman begins sobbing. If the characters leave without confronting the woman and return later, the ghost is gone (along with the ropes that seemed to bind it).

The White Lady rarely manifests on land, and her ghost can be seen only by those who dared to summon it (as the characters did when they participated in Rinaldo's sÃÂ©ance). If one or more characters come within 5 feet of the ghost, it throws back its head to reveal a bare skull with a rictus grin, catching characters by surprise with its Horrifying Visage. Once the ghost's true nature is revealed, the ropes binding it to the figurehead fade away as it attacks the nearest character. If the ghost is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it tries to possess a character on its next turn. A possessed host will attempt to leave the Town Hall by the northern exit and drown itself in Lac Dinneshere by walking out onto the ice until it breaks, attacking anyone who gets in its way.

If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it fades away with a scream as the White Lady's spirit is forced back to the lake, where it remains thereafter.

![Bound to a demonic figurehead is a haunting figure, but not all is what it seems](img/adventure/IDRotF/057-01-028.webp)

#### T7. Chair Storage

Stacked neatly against the walls of this room are dozens of wooden chairs used for town meetings.

#### T8. Records Room

This room contains records for the town, stored in boxes that lean haphazardly against the walls.

#### T9. Event Venue

This room is used for parties and other special events. It contains wooden tables and chairs, and colorful streamers hang from the rafters. A curtained window looks down on area T6.

#### T10. Small Claims Court

Residents of Easthaven come here to settle claims for petty crimes. Rows of wooden chairs face a large, cloth-covered table, behind which the speaker sits while presiding over small claims court cases. Next to this table is a small writing desk for the court clerk.

### Easthaven Town Hall (T11-T19)

#### T11. Fishing Permits

>>Three desks stand side-by-side in the room, the backs of their chairs facing the outside wall. Pinned to the east wall is a large, hand-drawn map framed with old fishing poles. One of the poles is rigged with a lime green fishing lure carved to resemble a tiny flumph.
>>

Easthaven fishers come here to apply for and renew their fishing permits. The map on the east wall shows Lac Dinneshere, with boundaries to mark the fishing territories of Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig.

#### T12. Employee Breakroom

This room contains several cozy chairs, a snack cabinet, and a wooden staircase leading up to area T14.

#### T13. Supply Closet

Supplies and provisions are stored on wooden shelves that line the walls of this room.

#### T14. Town Library

Easthaven's meager library contains a mostly unremarkable collection of books stored in dusty bookcases. Other furnishings include padded chairs and footstools. Wooden stairs lead down to area T12.

***Treasure.*** Characters who spend at least 10 minutes searching the bookshelves discover a worn book with a red leather cover and yellow pages. The edges of the pages are stained with dry blood. The writing inside suggests the book is nothing more than a poetry anthology. However, it's actually the spellbook of a Red Wizard of Thay named Dzaan. The book's true contents are hidden by an *illusory script* spell that ends 5 days after Dzaan's execution (see "Public Execution").

After the book was confiscated by a member of the town militia, it was brought to the Town Hall, where a clerk saw fit to place it in this library for safe keeping. Casting *dispel magic* on the book ends the *illusory script* spell placed upon it. When the *illusory script* spell ends, the book's true contents are revealed. It contains the following spells: *animate objects*, *arcane eye*, *arcane lock*, *blur*, *confusion*, *conjure elemental*, *detect magic*, *disguise self*, *fireball*, *hallucinatory terrain*, *illusory script*, *invisibility*, *knock*, *levitate*, *magic missile*, *major image*, *mirror image*, *mislead*, *phantasmal force*, *phantasmal killer*, *seeming*, *sending*, *silent image*, and *slow*.

#### T15. Office and Storage Space

Residents of Easthaven can rent out these small rooms for personal storage or office use. Of the six available rooms, only two are currently in use; the rest are empty.

The first room in use contains several storage crates and barrels. If the characters investigate further, they discover all these containers are empty.

The second room in use has been converted into a cozy office. Two overstuffed chairs and a wooden desk are crammed into the space. Inside the desk's unlocked drawer is a half-finished romance novel titled *Lost in Lavender Orbs*.

#### T16. Stairs to the Dungeon

Stone stairs covered with wooden planks lead down to the dungeon, which is hewn out of solid rock.

#### T17. Jailers' Room

Unless they have been called away by a disturbance elsewhere, four guards (**tribal warriors**) sit around a circular wooden table, playing *Three-Dragon Ante* with a well-worn deck of cards. Characters who listen at the door before entering can hear these soldiers complaining about the cold and wondering when the next lottery will be held (see "Sacrifices to Auril"). One of the guards carries a ring of eight iron keys; these keys unlock the cell doors in area T18.

#### T18. Jail

Individuals arrested for crimes in Easthaven are detained here. Each cell sports a locked iron door with a 5-inch-square, iron-shuttered window built into it so that guards can peer into the cell without opening the door. One of the guards in area T17 carries the keys that unlock all the cell doors. The doors are too sturdy for the characters to force open using brute strength alone, but a character with thieves' tools can use an action to attempt to pick a door's lock from the outside, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

#### T19. Interrogation Room

Prisoners are brought here when Speaker Waylen has a mind to question them. The room contains a sturdy oak chair fitted with iron manacles, a mop, and a wooden bucket.

# Good Mead

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/058-01-029.shield-good-mead.webp)

Founded by immigrants from Chult and the Vilhon Reach, Good Mead is nestled between Redwaters and a nearby evergreen forest. The town's squat dwellings, adorned with carvings of dinosaurs and serpents, are overshadowed by the two-story structure of the mead hall, its eaves carved and painted to resemble wyverns. As honey is the key ingredient in mead, the town literally buzzes with the droning of bees.

 Every tavern in Icewind Dale is accustomed to receiving regular mead deliveries, and the town can't produce or deliver its mead fast enough. All deliveries have halted temporarily, thoughÃ¢ÂÂbecause a **verbeeg marauder** (see *appendix C*) emerged from the forest three days ago and stole three casks of mead that were being loaded onto a dogsled for transport to Bryn Shander. Kendrick Rielsbarrow, the town speaker and a giant of a man in his own right, stood his ground against the verbeeg and didn't fare well. After skewering Kendrick with its spear, the verbeeg grabbed the casks and disappeared whence he came. The other residents of Good Mead tried to save Kendrick, to no avail; his body lies in a local shrine. Five members of the militia went after the verbeeg but haven't returned.

- **Population.** 100.
- **Leader.** None. Speaker Kendrick Rielsbarrow was killed by a verbeeg, leaving the town leaderless.

***Militia.*** Good Mead can muster up to 20 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 2 **veterans**.

## Overland Travel

A path connects Good Mead to the Eastway, crosses the snow-covered road, and continues to Caer-Dineval. Another snowy path leads to Dougan's Hole. Travel times in the Overland Travel from Good Mead table assume that characters are on foot; mounts and dogsleds can shorten these times by as much as 50 percent.

## Locations in Good Mead

![Map 1.12: Good Mead](img/adventure/IDRotF/059-map-1.12-good-mead.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/060-map-1.12-good-mead-player.webp)The following prominent locations are marked on map 1.12.

### Mead Hall

*Purveyor of Good Mead's honey wine*

Four decades ago, this mead hall put an end to the town's dependence on knucklehead trout fishing with its famous honey wine, which quickly became popular throughout Ten-Towns.

 The mead hall has a large, fire-heated space dedicated to bee husbandry and the nurturing of beehives. The droning bees can be heard throughout the town, though most residents are so accustomed to the buzzing that they pay it no mind.

> ##### Electing a New Town Speaker
>
>Good Mead also needs a new leader, and two locals have emerged as contenders to replace Kendrick Rielsbarrow as town speaker. It will take a week or two for the town to plan an election. One candidate is a red-bearded shield dwarf logger named Shandar Froth, and the other is Olivessa Untapoor, a middle-aged woman who descends from the town's Chultan founders and who makes casks to hold Good Mead's famous brew.
>
> Shandar is wanted by the authorities in Mirabar for the murder of another dwarf. Zhentarim agents located Shandar a few years back and are blackmailing him into serving as their eyes and ears in town. Once a month, Shandar travels to Targos to brief Naerth Maxildanarr, its speaker, on everything that has transpired of late in Good Mead.
>
> Olivessa doesn't want to be town speaker, but her friends are pushing her to assume the role for the good of the town. She would be delighted to see someone else step up to challenge Shandar for the speakership.
>
> For more information on Olivessa and Shandar, see the "New Town Speaker".
>

### Shrine of the Flaming Sword

*Shrine of Tempus (god of war)*

This vacant building stands on the lakeshore and has a crow-haunted steeple protruding from its peak. Unlike the mead hall, which is well cared for, the shrine's painted icons of the god of war wielding a flaming sword are chipped and faded, and its spacious interior stands mostly empty except for a long table on which rests a body covered with a blanket. The body is that of Speaker Kendrick Rielsbarrow, a giant of a man in his forties. He died from three stab wounds to the chest.

 The shrine was built over a century ago, when the town's rivalry with Dougan's Hole raged so fiercely that the lake, a frequent battlefield, became known as Redwaters. For a time thereafter, nearly all residents of Good Mead paid homage to Tempus. Today, the shrine's relevance has dwindled to the point where it's mainly used just for town gatherings.

## The Mead Must Flow

Taverns throughout Ten-Towns depend on deliveries of honey mead to satisfy their customers, and Good Mead needs the coin. Two days ago, a verbeeg (see *appendix C*) stole three casks of mead as they were being loaded onto a dogsled. When the town speaker tried to prevent the theft, the verbeeg killed him. The townsfolk want revenge, but more important, they want their mead back!

 If the characters undertake this quest, they must track the verbeeg to his lair, which he shares with a dopey ogre, some stolen livestock, and a sleepy brown bear. To complicate matters, the verbeeg's romantic interestÃ¢ÂÂanother verbeegÃ¢ÂÂarrives as the characters are leaving.

 How the characters learn of the town's travails depends on whether the adventure began in Good Mead or not. If Good Mead is the starting town for the adventure, the characters know all the information in the "Good Mead" section, which you can read to the players. If Good Mead is not the starting town for the adventure, characters become aware of the town's misfortunes when one or more locals put them up for the night.

### Getting the Quest

If the characters offer to retrieve the stolen casks, the locals can't reward them with much more than free lodging and drink for a tenday. If the characters accept these terms, various townsfolk can point in the direction the verbeeg went after stealing the casks.

 As the characters make their way to the edge of the forest, read:

>>A figure in cold weather clothing lurches out of the woods into plain view, running as fast as he can through the deep snow. Slung over his back are a pair of animal traps, one of which appears to contain a panicked fox.
>>

The figure is Fef Moryn (chaotic good human **scout**), a trapper. He was out in the woods checking his traps when he came upon a grisly scene: five members of Good Mead's militia, their skulls and chests stove in. He came straight home to alert the town.

 The characters can't convince Fef to return to the bodies, but they can follow his tracks through the snow easily enough.

 The **fox** (see *appendix C*) in Fef's trap is rattled but uninjured. If the characters want to buy it, Fef will sell it to them for no less than 1 gp. Although it's a wild animal, it remains docile while held. If the characters keep the fox with them, they will find it helpful in the next scene.

### Carnage in the Woods

Characters who follow Fef Moryn's trail eventually come to the grisly scene the trapper spoke of:

>>Deep in the woods, amid the snow-covered pines, you discover the remains of the five militia members, who look like they were clubbed to death. New-fallen snow has already begun to settle on their corpses.
>>

These five people pursued the verbeeg for a while and then fell prey to the verbeeg's ogre buddy, who stayed behind in the woods rather than trying to keep up with the verbeeg.

 The ogre killed all five humans with its greatclub and then headed for home. Characters can follow its tracks in the snow without a check. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies these tracks as belonging to a Large giant. Following these tracks leads the characters on a path through the woods until, after 8 hours, they come upon the verbeeg's lair.

#### The Fox and the Chwinga

The characters have one encounter while they follow the ogre's trail. A **chwinga** (see *appendix C*) pops out of the snow and hurls a wee snowball at the lead character in the party's marching order. Once it has the party's attention, it capers atop the snow.

 If the characters rescued the fox from Fef Moryn, the animal bolts toward the **chwinga** if it's allowed to do so. The **chwinga** bows before the fox and offers it a frozen berry, which the fox gobbles up. After that, the **chwinga** and the fox become fast friends. The **chwinga** mounts the fox, bestows a *charm of animal conjuring* or one of the new charms described in appendix C (see "New Chwinga Charms") upon the character it hit with the snowball, and rides off on the fox's back. (For more information on charms, see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.) The characters can interrupt this scene if they want; the **chwinga** won't bestow its supernatural charm, however, if events unfold any differently.

 If the characters don't have the fox or choose not to let it go, the **chwinga** follows them all the way to the verbeeg lair, if permitted to do so, but won't venture inside.

![The snow-covered tusks of a mammoth mark the entrance to the verbeeg lair](img/adventure/IDRotF/061-01-030.verbeeg-lair.webp)

### Verbeeg Lair

The lair's caves and tunnels have rough, 20-foot-high ceilings covered with large icicles. The floors are somewhat uneven but not rough enough to be difficult terrain.

 The verbeeg, named Duhg, needs light to see, which is why he keeps a bonfire lit in area V3 and carries a torch when he visits the darker corners of his lair.

![Map 1.13: Verbeeg Lair](img/adventure/IDRotF/062-map-1.13-verbeeg-lair.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/063-map-1.13-verbeeg-lair-player.webp) The following locations are keyed to map 1.13.

#### V1. Three Entrances

The ogre's tracks lead characters to a frozen stream, then along it to the verbeeg's lair:

>>The trail culminates at a rocky hillside with pines growing around its base. Set into the hill are three caves.
>>
>> The frozen creek emerges from the west cave, which has a low-hanging mouth.
>>
>> The center caveÃ¢ÂÂan eight-foot-high passage hewn from the rockÃ¢ÂÂis moderately blocked by a tight stand of conifers and two massive fallen logs.
>>
>> The northeast cave has a big, yawning mouth, and flickers of light emanate from within. The tracks of your quarry head through this entrance.
>>

Characters can enter the verbeeg lair through any of these paths. If they take the time to examine the hillside to the east more thoroughly, they find a fourth cave entrance (area V2).

#### V2. Main Entrance

>>Half-submerged in the icy mire are the bones, skull, and tusks of a long-dead mammoth. Beyond these remains is a yawning cave mouth.
>>

This route leads to the firelit cave (area V3) and the refuse pit (area V4).

#### V3. Firelit Cave

This cavern is slightly sunken, as all tunnels leading to it slope down gradually.

>>A bonfire in the middle of this cave keeps it lit and relatively warm. The scent of roasting meat fills the air as a hunk of meat on a spit drips juices into the fire. Goats and sheep are held in a spacious animal pen enclosed by a crude wooden fence. Other features of the cave include a wooden cart with a broken wheel, two old crates, and two barrels.
>>

If the characters make a lot of noise, the **ogre** comes running from area V5 and the **verbeeg marauder** (see *appendix C*) approaches from area V9, both arriving at the same time. They try to kill intruders on sight. If more than two intruders are visible, the verbeeg whistles for the cave bear, which arrives 3 rounds later from area V7.

 If it's close enough to the bonfire, the verbeeg can use his action to try to shove a creature into the flames (see "*Shoving a Creature*" in the combat chapter of the *Player's Handbook*). Any creature that enters the bonfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. It also catches fire as it leaves the bonfire's space, taking 3 (1d6) fire damage at the starts of each of its turns until an action is used to put out the flames engulfing it.

 Characters in a position to harm the verbeeg's goats and sheep (see "Animals" below) can use an action to threaten one or more of these animals and, with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, cause the verbeeg to cease hostilities and call off the ogre and the cave bear. Under such pressure, the verbeeg is willing to let intruders leave the lair without further incident, provided the animals in the pen are not harmed or taken.

 One crate is packed with straw, which the verbeeg feeds to the goats and sheep. The other contains ten large torches, which the verbeeg made out of wood and pitch. The barrels are half-filled with salt and pepper, which the verbeeg uses to season his meat.

***Animals.*** The livestock pen holds seven **goats** and six sheep, all in healthy condition. Use the **goat** stat block for each sheep, with these changes:

- A sheep is a Small beast with 3 (1d6) hit points and a walking speed of 30 feet.
- It lacks the Charge feature and any effective attacks, giving it a challenge rating of 0 (0 XP).

 The verbeeg acquired his livestock by robbing travelers on the Eastway. He considers these beasts his treasured pets and has given names to all of them. He has trained the ogre and the cave bear not to attack them.

***What's Cooking.*** The meat roasting on the spit is a piece of what used to be Artin Glanhig, a shield dwarf lumberjack from Bryn Shander who crossed paths with the verbeeg. A small bundle near a log by the fire contains Artin's battleaxe and his thick leather boots. The verbeeg is fashioning a small knife he can use to carefully unstitch the boots and reuse the leather.

#### V4. Refuse Pit

>>This dead-end cavern has a crudely excavated, ten-foot-wide pit in the middle of the floor.
>>

The verbeeg and the ogre dug this refuse pit, which is 20 feet deep and filled to a depth of 5 feet with bones, trash, and filth. 

#### V5. Stolen Mead Casks

If the ogre has been drawn to area V3 by activity there, omit the opening paragraph of the following boxed text:

>>A heavy snore comes from a fat, battle-scarred ogre sitting with its back against the west wall, its chin on its chest. A thin stream of drool trails from its mouth onto its bloodstained leather loincloth. On the floor at its feet is a bloody greatclub with tufts of hair and bits of metal stuck in it.
>>
>> Suspended from the ceiling of this chamber by a series of ropes and pulleys are six baskets. Clustered near the south wall are three wooden casks carved with Good Mead's heraldic symbol: a drinking mug made of a cut-off section of horn, with an antler handle added, upright and centered.
>>

The **ogre** can never remember its name, so the verbeeg calls it "Friend." It has fully recovered from its fight with the town militia. Any character who succeeds on a DC 8 Dexterity (Stealth) check can creep around in the cave without waking the ogre. The character must repeat the check after disturbing an object in the cave, such as a hanging basket or a cask of mead.

 If awakened, the ogre grabs its greatclub and attacks, shouting, "ME FRIEND!"

 The verbeeg rigged the system that supports the baskets to keep the ogre from tripping over them and to discourage the cave bear from rooting through them. Lowering a basket by using its mechanism requires an action. The baskets contain sheep shears, milk pails, bristle brushes, and several bags of grain and oats stolen from caravans on the Eastway. One of the baskets, determined randomly, contains the verbeeg's treasure (see "Treasure" below).

***Casks of Honey Mead.*** One of the three casks is empty, the verbeeg and ogre having shared its contents; each of the other two holds 20 gallons of honey mead. Each full cask weighs 200 pounds.

***Treasure.*** The verbeeg's treasure basket holds 72 sp, 344 cp, a translucent pink *moss agate* gemstone (10 gp), a *healer's kit*, a *hunting trap*, and a small rabbit-skin bag containing ten silvered *sling stones*.

#### V6. Frozen Stream

>>To the north along the frozen stream, the tunnel splits, with one way continuing north and the other veering east. The stream follows the dark northward tunnel. Light from a distant fire is visible in the eastern tunnel.
>>

Characters who follow the frozen stream to the north arrive at area V7. Those who venture eastward come to area V9.

#### V7. Cave Bear's Lair

>>The frozen stream ends at a seven-foot-deep frozen pool at the back of a dark cave. Trapped beneath the pool's ice is a stone statue of a smiling young man, naked except for a well-placed oak leaf, with his face turned toward the sky.
>>

If the cave bear has not been summoned elsewhere by the verbeeg, it sleeps in the western niche of this chamber until it detects intruders. It has brown fur and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It otherwise uses the **polar bear** stat block. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check can sneak around in the cave without waking the bear, but only in the dark. A light source bright enough to illuminate the bear also wakes it. The bear, whose name is Yogobor, is hungry and hostile. But if it is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer and the verbeeg is nowhere in sight, the bear tries to flee for its life.

 The bear's niche contains the gnawed skull and bones of a shield dwarf named Artin Glanhig (see area V3).

***Statue of Silvanus.*** The statue in the frozen pool, crafted using *stone shape* spells, is an outcrop extending from the pool's rocky bottom. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes it as a depiction of Silvanus, a god of nature; the oak leaf is his holy symbol. The statue radiates an aura of abjuration magic when scrutinized with a *detect magic* spell. An *identify* spell can reveal its magical nature, but only if the caster is touching the statue when the spell is cast. Before the statue can be touched, the characters must dig through a foot of ice to reach it.

 The statue blesses the pool, such that any creature that drinks from it gains the benefit of a *greater restoration* spell. This magic is suppressed while the pool is frozen. A given creature can gain the pool's benefit only once.

#### V8. Burial Niches

>>This eight-foot-high, five-foot-wide passage has a dozen burial niches carved into its walls.
>>

An ancient human tribe carved a tomb out of the hillside to house the bones of their chieftain, whose remains are housed in area V10. Each burial niche in this tunnel is 2 feet wide, 2 feet tall, and 5 feet deep. The bones of warriors were placed here to guard the way to the chieftain's tomb. Animals have savaged the bones, leaving nothing but a couple of skulls and carved stone knives behind.

#### V9. Duhg Is Here

A natural tunnel bisects a ring-shaped excavation in this area, which was once an additional burial chamber. Niches cut in the north end of the outer ring hold nothing of interest.

 Duhg the **verbeeg marauder** (see *appendix C*) is here if he hasn't been encountered somewhere else. Duhg is sitting cross-legged in the tunnel, a lit torch on the floor nearby. The verbeeg is sharpening a stone knife he found in the old tomb. Duhg plans to use this knife to unstitch the dwarven boots in area V3. Leaning against a wall, within easy reach, is Duhg's spear.

#### V10. Ancient Tomb

>>Carved steps on the south side climb five feet to this ten-foot-high, fifteen-foot-square room, which has narrow, natural exits in the east and west walls. In the middle of the room is a rectangular stone block seven feet long, four feet wide, and three feet tall. Pictographs on the walls of the chamber tell a tale of one tribe's journey through mighty mountains and across a perilous tundra.
>>

A tribal chieftain was laid to rest here in ancient times. The pictographs illustrate how the chieftain led her tribe to settle in Icewind Dale, how they fought off terrible monsters to claim their land, and how they found peace in their new home. Characters who study the artwork can pick out an image of the chieftain wielding a wand and casting a destructive spell.

 It takes a combined Strength of 50 to move the block. Revealed beneath it is a shallow niche in the floor that holds the bones of a female human, her tribal garb reduced to dust and tatters.

***Treasure.*** Clutched in the chieftain's left hand is a *pearl of power*. In her right hand is a +1 *wand of the war mage*. A curse befalls any creature that removes either magic item or any of the chieftain's remains from the burial niche. Until the curse ends on it, the creature is haunted by phantasmal nightmares whenever it takes a long rest and gains no benefit from that rest. Replacing the stolen object ends the curse, as does a *remove curse* spell or similar magic.

![Gahg the verbeeg has a basket of goodies for her beloved Duhg](img/adventure/IDRotF/064-01-031.gahg-the-verbeeg.webp)

### Affairs of the Heart

As the characters exit the verbeeg lair, read:

>>A verbeeg strides through the snow, approaching the mouth of the cave. Her misshapen face bears a too-wide smile. She clutches a spear in one hand while using her other arm to cradle a wicker basket filled with bits of shiny metal. "Duhg?" she shouts in Common. "You home?"
>>

Gahg, a **verbeeg marauder** (see *appendix C*), has arrived for a romantic encounter with Duhg. Gahg has brought along some fragments of metal that she hopes will impress Duhg, who had been planning to give Gahg a cask of honey mead.

 If the characters try to stop Gahg from entering Duhg's lair, Gahg becomes alarmed, then enraged. She drops the wicker basket and attacks the characters, afraid that something terrible has happened to Duhg.

 If the characters run away, Gahg checks on Duhg to make sure he is unharmed, allowing the party a head start back to Good Mead. If the characters run back into the verbeeg lair and try to hide, Gahg searches for them after locating Duhg.

 If only one verbeeg survives contact with the characters, it won't rest until it has revenge for the death of its potential mate. A verbeeg is smart enough not to act rashly against the party, but it might vent its fury by launching more hit-and-run attacks on Good Mead.

#### Gahg's Basket of Bits

The metal fragments gathered by Gahg are pieces of a futuristic weapon that was jettisoned from the cargo hold of an illithid nautiloid before the spaceship crashed (see "Id Ascendant"). Gahg witnessed the crash, which looked like a comet streaking across the sky, then found the weapon's wreckage and took some of it. A character who examines the fragments and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that the metal is not something one could expect to find on this world.

***Treasure.*** The metal bits are worth a total of 75 gp to a tinkerer or blacksmith.

### Concluding the Quest

Once the characters find the two remaining casks of honey mead, they'll need to figure out a way to haul them back to Good Mead. After they solve that problem, they have a safe trip back to town. The townsfolk are happy to see the stolen mead returned but express concern if the characters left one or both of the verbeeg alive. After all, what's to stop them from terrorizing the town again?

#### New Town Speaker

As the characters are recuperating from their adventure or planning their next excursion, a local cask maker named Olivessa Untapoor (neutral good human **commoner**) approaches the party leader, if there is one. If no character has assumed that role, Olivessa approaches the character with highest Charisma score:

>>A middle-aged woman approaches you and removes her thick wool scarf so that she can speak clearly. "My name is Olivessa, and I make the casks for the mead. Some friends of mine don't want Shandar Froth to become our next town speaker. They say he's untrustworthy. I don't know him that well, but I've been urged to run against him. I have no interest in the speakership, but you seem to be a good leader, and this town could use one. What do you say?"
>>

Olivessa is ready and willing to throw her support behind any character who runs in the election for the speakership, and since she's a leading candidate herself, her support carries weight. Her opponent, Shandar Froth (neutral shield dwarf **commoner**), doesn't like this turn of events. After accusing the characters of having no stake in Good Mead's future, he leaves town for a day to get help (see "Zhentarim Intervention" below).

 A character who spends at least 1 hour making inquiries throughout town can learn the following information about the two leading candidates for the speakership:

- Olivessa has deep roots in Good Mead. Her family has lived in the town since its founding. She's quite reserved and doesn't have any family of her own. She lives alone in the house closest to the Shrine of the Flaming Sword.
- Shandar has lived in Good Mead for a few years and is popular among the town's loggers. He can be a bully and a blowhard, but there's nothing he wouldn't do for his friends. He lives with five other loggers in a small house on the west side of town.

***Zhentarim Intervention.*** Shandar is under the thumb of Naerth Maxildanarr, the speaker of Targos. Faced with the possibility of losing the election, Shandar makes the 8-hour hike to Targos to warn Naerth and then promptly returns home. A day later, eight human **thugs** storm the mead hall in cold weather clothing. Before the characters can intervene, Shandar and his fellow loggers confront the thugs and kick them out of town with their tails between their legs. The whole incident is orchestrated to make Shandar into a local hero. Characters who capture and interrogate one or more of the thugs learn that Naerth Maxildanarr hired them.

If the characters fail to expose the deception, Shandar is elected town speaker, giving the Zhentarim a political foothold in Good Mead.

# Lonelywood

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/065-01-032.shield-lonelywood.webp)

Founded by a Sembian family from Urmlaspyr, Lonelywood is a quiet town of loggers, fishers, and scrimshanders scratching out a living on the edge of the world. The town's oldest buildings and docks bear carvings of dragons, lions, and goats that pay deference to the family's crest, which featured a chimera.

Roughly half of Lonelywood's able-bodied residents trawl the lake for knucklehead trout, while most of the others spend their days in the forest felling and hewing the trees that are used to construct boats and buildings. Lonelywood's timber is taken by cart to be sold in other settlements, Termalaine and Targos in particular.

For as long as Ten-Towns has existed, Lonelywood has attracted the region's shadiest element, from unrepentant thieves to cold-hearted killers. The thick forest looming behind it conceals the dark and sordid dealings that sometimes transpire there. Despite its attraction to criminals and miscreants, Lonelywood is not a place where folk murder each other in the streets. The realities of survival demand that the residents live and work together, and not dwell on history. A visitor can make many friends here but would be wise not to drudge up the dark deeds of anyone's past in this small town.

## Lonelywood in a Nutshell

**Friendliness** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Services** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Comfort** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

***Available Quest.*** "The White Moose".

- **Population.** 100.

***Leader.*** Speaker Nimsy Huddle (lawful good strongheart halfling **commoner**) speaks for the townsfolk. Ever since the local inn closed its doors, Nimsy has opened her heated attic to visitors looking for a place to crash for the night. She bakes halfling-shaped cookies and brings them to meetings of the Council of Speakers.

***Militia.*** Lonelywood can muster up to 50 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 4 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** Two narrow white triangles, one descending from the center top, the other rising from center bottom, almost meet on a forest-green field. The top triangle represents an icicle, denoting Lonelywood's northerly location; the bottom triangle is an ivory horn, representing the town's scrimshaw trade.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Food (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivals.** Bremen, Targos, Termalaine.

## Overland Travel

A three-mile-long snow-covered path connects Lonelywood to Termalaine. Characters on foot can walk this path in 2 hours; mounts and dogsleds can shorten this time by as much as 50 percent.

## Locations in Lonelywood

Lonelywood has no inns or other places for visitors to rest, except for the town speaker's house, which has a spacious, heated attic that can accommodate characters looking for a night's rest. Other residents of Lonelywood value their privacy and are much less inclined to welcome strangers into their meager dwellings.

![Map 1.14: Lonelywood](img/adventure/IDRotF/066-map-1.14-lonelywood.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/067-map-1.14-lonelywood-player.webp)The following locations are marked on map 1.14.

### The Happy Scrimshander

*Shop*

This little shop facing the docks sells the tools of the scrimshander's trade: needles and knives in a wide array of shapes and sizes, inks in a rainbow of colors, and wax used to seal an engraving when it's done. The shop's owner is a doughy spinster of few words named Iriskree Harrowhill (retired neutral human **assassin**). She doesn't talk about her shady past except to speak fondly of people she once knew who have since died.

### The Lucky Liar

*Tavern*

Fishers and woodcutters gather here in the evenings to weave tall talesÃ¢ÂÂthe more outrageous and embellished, the better. From time to time, patrons whose tongues have been loosened by drink let slip valuable or dangerous secrets. Characters who loiter in the tavern are likely to hear a rumor or two, which you can determine by rolling on the Ten-Towns Rumors table (see "Ten-Towns Rumors").

The tavern's raven-haired barkeep, Danae Xotal (lawful evil human **spy**), files away these secrets as she goes about her serving work with quiet circumspection. Her secret is that she's a Thayan agent working for Szass Tam, the most powerful lich in Thay. Danae was planted in Icewind Dale years ago to watch for enemies of Szass Tam who might seek refuge in Ten-Towns. No one else in Ten-Towns knows her secret, and those she has marked as enemies in the past have quietly vanished.

### Ramshackle

*Closed inn*

This aptly named buildingÃ¢ÂÂwhich used to be the only inn in townÃ¢ÂÂclosed after its last owner, a retired sawyer named DeGrootz, hanged himself in the common room two years ago. Some locals believe that DeGrootz's hanging was staged to conceal his murder at the hands of some old "friends" of his. Townsfolk are currently using the vacant building for lumber storage, but anyone interested in refurbishing and reopening the old inn is welcome to try.

![The dreaded white moose of Lonelywood is no one's prey](img/adventure/IDRotF/068-01-033.white-moose.webp)

## The White Moose

A white moose is attacking loggers in the forest near Lonelywood. The town's logging industry is essential to the growth and survival of Ten-Towns, and Speaker Nimsy Huddle has assured the other speakers that Lonelywood's "moose problem" will be dealt with in short order. Hunters have been dispatched to kill the moose, but it has eluded them so far. From what the hunters have seen, their prey is smarter than the average moose, and its white hide makes it hard to spot in the snow. What they don't know is that the moose is using a magic mirror as a scrying device to show it where its enemies are.

Speaker Huddle tries to seduce the characters with a basket of halfling-shaped cookies, hoping they'll join the hunt for the white moose. If the characters turn her down, Speaker Huddle sweetens the deal with coin.

The white moose is an awakened beast that serves Ravisin, the same evil frost druid who awakened the plesiosaurus in Maer Dualdon (see "Lake Monster"). This druid has cast *awaken* spells on several beasts, gifting them with human-level intelligence and the ability to speak, and uses them to spy on settlements and terrorize their inhabitants. Ravisin has taken refuge in an elven tomb in the woods and won't rest until the forest is free of loggers. Simply killing the white moose will not solve Lonelywood's problem; to end the threat to Lonelywood and other towns, the characters must stop the druid from awakening more beasts and using them to harm Ten-Towners.

### Getting the Quest

If the characters aren't staying in Nimsy Huddle's attic, they are summoned to the town speaker's home by one of her childrenÃ¢ÂÂa cheery little halfling named Scoop. When the characters pay Speaker Huddle a visit, read:

>>Nimsy Huddle, the town speaker, tempts you with freshly baked, halfling-shaped cookies. Her house was clearly built for humans, but most of the furniture is sized for halflings, with a few big chairs for visitors of taller stock. Four halfling children scamper from room to room and climb a ladder up to the loft, chasing one another with wooden swords, while a fire crackles in the hearth in Speaker Huddle's cluttered kitchen.
>>
>>"Our loggers are being terrorized by a white moose," says Speaker Huddle, "and the beast has eluded the hunters we've sent to kill it. We depend on the forest for our survival. I wouldn't be a very good town speaker if I let a dumb moose get the better of us. Will you help?"
>>

If the characters demand more than tasty treats as an incentive, Speaker Huddle is willing to pay them 100 gp for the moose's head, though she can be talked up to 125 gp with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. She suggests that the characters can sell the moose's carcass to a local butcher for 10 gp. If the characters want the pot sweetened further, Speaker Huddle says she can offer them Ramshackle (the closed inn) as an investment property, to do with what they will. "Of course," she adds with a smile, "if our hunters get the moose first, the rewards will be theirs!"

### Tracking the Moose

To find the white moose, the characters must venture into the forest and search for the beast's tracks in the snow. Any character who spends an hour searching for moose tracks and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check finds a set of them. If the characters follow these tracks, roll a d6. On a 6, the tracks lead to the elven tomb, where the white moose can be found. On any other roll, the tracks lead to an ordinary moose (use the **giant goat** stat block) that's encountered after 1d4 hours. This moose poses no threat if the characters leave it alone. After each encounter with an ordinary moose, the characters can repeat their search for moose tracks and, upon finding some, make another d6 roll to determine if the tracks belong to the elusive white moose.

After every three hours the characters spend in the forest, check for a random encounter using the Lonelywood Forest Encounters table.

##### Lonelywood Forest Encounters
|  d20  | Encounter     |
|:-----:|---------------|
|  1Ã¢ÂÂ10 | No encounter  |
| 11Ã¢ÂÂ12 | Banshee       |
| 13Ã¢ÂÂ14 | Brown bear(s) |
| 15Ã¢ÂÂ16 | Chwingas      |
| 17Ã¢ÂÂ18 | Fox and hare  |
| 19Ã¢ÂÂ20 | Wolf pack     |

#### Banshee

This **banshee** is the spectral remnant of a female elf warrior who was banished for a selfish, evil act. It wields a spectral longbow that shoots phantom arrows. This weapon has the range of a standard longbow and is used to make ranged spell attacks; it otherwise functions like the banshee's Corrupting Touch.

There is only one banshee haunting the forest. If it's destroyed, it re-forms after 24 hours in a random location in the forest, damned to its eternal exile.

#### Brown Bear(s)

A hungry **brown bear** is pulling some low branches off a tree and gnawing on them when it sees the party and moves toward the group in search of tastier food. A character can use an action to try to frighten away the bear, doing so with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If the characters kill this bear, the next brown bear encounter (if this result comes up again) is with the bear's mate and 1d4 cubs (noncombatants).

#### Chwingas

As the characters navigate the woods or stop to rest, 1d4 **chwingas** (see *appendix C*) take an interest in them.

#### Fox and Hare

The characters spot an arctic **fox** patiently stalking a snowshoe **hare** (see *appendix C* for both creatures' stat blocks). If the characters leave the animals alone, roll a d6 to determine what happens next. On an odd roll, the hare escapes from the fox; on an even roll, the fox catches the hare and takes it back to its lair.

Characters can interrupt the fox's hunt and speak to either animal using magic or an ability that facilitates communication with small beasts. Speaking to the fox prompts the hare to flee, and vice versa. A friendly animal can lead the characters to the white moose's tracks in the snow after 1d4 hours.

#### Wolf Pack

A pack of 1d4 + 4 **wolves** descends upon the party. If three or more wolves are killed, the surviving wolves flee.

### Finding the Elven Tomb

The elven tomb lies on a lightly wooded slope. An ancient moon dial is its centerpiece. Characters can find the tomb if they follow the tracks of a beast such as the white moose. Ancient elven magic tricks all aberrations, fiends, giants, humanoids, and undead into veering away from the site without the slightest inkling that they've been magically misdirected.

When the characters come within sight of the elven tomb, read:

>>The tracks lead to a large, circular indentation in a snowy hillside. Rising from the middle of this circle is a triangular gnomon of beautifully carved crystal that stands twenty feet tall. A ten-foot-high berm hugging the circle's eastern edge has evergreens growing around and atop it, sheltering what looks like a sarcophagus buried under snow and enclosed by a half-circle of pale blue crystal pillars. North of the berm is a delicately carved gazebo made of marble, and south of the berm is a row of outward-facing, white marble statues atop granite pillars.
>>

If the characters watch the location for an hour or more from a safe distance away, they see the **awakened white moose** (see the accompanying stat block) emerge from under the hillside, stand in the moon dial, and sniff the air for a few minutes before ambling back toward Lonelywood to continue its reign of terror. If the characters explore the elven tomb without delay, they encounter the moose in area E6.

### Elven Tomb Locations

![Map 1.15: Elven Tomb](img/adventure/IDRotF/069-map-1.15-elven-tomb.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/070-map-1.15-elven-tomb-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.15. Areas E1 through E5 are outside; areas E6 through E9 are underground.

#### E1. Elf Statues

>>Six elevated, white marble statues arranged in a line depict slender, robed figures facing northward. The engraving on their faces has been worn away by the wind, but pointed ears make the statues identifiable as elves.
>>

Each statue is life-sized, depicting an elf standing rigidly atop a 7-foot-high cylindrical base of wind-worn granite. (A seventh statue stands alone atop the northern tip of area E4, facing south. Three more statues, unseen from this vantage point, are located under the hill in area E6.) A *detect magic* spell or similar magic reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each statue.

If all ten statues are toppled, the magical effect that directs the intruders away from the tomb ends (see "Finding the Elven Tomb" above). Toppling a statue requires a combined Strength of 25.

#### E2. Barrow Entrance

>>Embedded in the hillside south of the circular indentation is a stone door with no visible handles or hinges.
>>

The door is snug and airtight. It can be opened only from the inside (by a creature in area E6) or by using a *knock* spell or similar magic.

#### E3. Marble Gazebo

>>In the middle of the gazebo sits an unlit stone brazier, its bowl twenty inches in diameter. The brazier is full of snow and pine needles that the winds have swept away from the gazebo's polished marble floor.
>>

The brazier is adhered to the marble floor and can't be budged.

When a pinecone, a twig, a feather, and a severed humanoid hand are placed in the brazier and set on fire (see area E4), a silver flame quickly consumes the brazier's contents and continues to burn for a tenday. This fire generates heat and light equivalent to that of a campfire and can't be extinguished.

#### E4. Sarcophagus and Crystal Pillars

>>Atop the eastern berm, a granite sarcophagus rests in a half-circle defined by five crystal pillars. Clearing the snow off the lid reveals an engraving of a brazier. You also notice a carving near the top of each pillar; from north to south, these images depict a twig, a pinecone, a flame, a feather, and a humanoid hand.
>>

The sarcophagus can't be opened until a twig, a pinecone, a feather, and a severed humanoid hand are placed in the brazier in the gazebo (area E3) and set ablaze. The lid of the sarcophagus can be opened as long as that fire burns; otherwise, no spell and no amount of force can open it. Characters who don't have a pinecone, a twig, or a feather can find these items in the nearby woods. The severed hand is a trickier get but needn't come from a living humanoid (a dead crawling claw would do).

Once the brazier is functioning, the heavy lid can be lifted or pushed aside. It weighs 500 pounds.

The sarcophagus holds Sahnar, a moon elf **mummy** that animates as soon as the lid no longer prevents it from sitting up. This mummy is chaotic good and acclimated to cold weather. It follows the commands of its liberators until it is reduced to 0 hit points, whereupon it crumbles to dust.

If the mummy receives conflicting orders, it follows whichever command it deems the most sensible, although its Intelligence score of 6 means that it can make bad choices. Sahnar speaks Common and Elvish. The mummy knows how the moon dial functions (see area E5) but knows nothing about the tomb's current inhabitants, Ten-Towns, or the present state of affairs in Icewind Dale, since it has been sealed up for hundreds of years. If the characters return to Ten-Towns with Sahnar in tow, they will need to disguise the elf mummy to keep it from frightening the townsfolk.

The magic and materials used to preserve the mummy have the effect of making it smell like pumpkin spice.

#### E5. Moon Dial

>>Rising from the center of the circular depression is a tall, triangular, crystal gnomonÃ¢ÂÂa device one typically finds in the middle of a sundial. It is thick near the base and narrows to a sharp point at the top. The snow around the gnomon has melted away, revealing a circle of symbols carved into the stone around it. The symbols depict phases of the moon, suggesting that the circular depression is not a sundial, but a moon dial.
>>
>>Something has punched a rough hole in the wall in the northwest edge of the depression, creating a dark opening that leads under the hill.
>>

Characters who peer through the western hole can see a dark, sunken chamber (area E6) beyond.

A persistent magical effect heats the face of the moon dial, ensuring that the lunar symbols remain clear of snow. The symbols depict a full moon to the north, a new moon to the south, and various waxing and waning phases of the moon in between.

Whenever the moon is in the sky over Icewind Dale, the crystal gnomon projects a triangle of moonlight onto the moon dial's face, its tip lighting the symbol that matches the moon's current phase. This occurs even if the moon is not visible in the sky.

Any character who studies the lunar symbols sees tiny inscriptions in Elvish around the full moon symbol (the white circle to the north) and the two half-moon symbols located on the west and east sides of the dial, but not the other partial moon symbols or new moon symbol (the black circle to the south). The inscriptions translate as follows:

***Full Moon Inscription.*** "Gaze upon your own face and have seven questions answered." The magic mirror in area E7 is activated for as long as the light of the gnomon or a *moonbeam* spell illuminates this symbol.

***Half-Moon Inscription.*** "Unlock the tombs of the half moon." While the light of the gnomon or a *moonbeam* spell illuminates either of the half-moon symbols on the moon dial's face, the doors to areas E8 and E9 can be opened.

#### E6. Barrow

The spacious chamber tucked under the hill is strewn with bones and holds the sleeping forms of several harmless animals (foxes, hares, goats, owls, wolf pups, and young bears) that share the space peacefully. The white moose makes its lair among these creatures as well when it's not out terrorizing Ten-Towners. If the characters didn't wait outside to encounter the **awakened white moose** (see the stat block), it fights them here, which startles and scares away the other animals. If the frost druid in area E9 hears sounds of battle in this room, she remains where she is, preferring to make a final stand there.

***Statues.*** In addition to the animals, this area contains three white marble statues of elves that are identical to the ones outside, except that the wind has not worn away the detail in their faces and they don't stand on pillars. All three are facing east, toward the nearest wall.

#### E7. Mirror of the Full Moon

>>The underground passage narrows before ending at a wall upon which is mounted an oval mirror seven feet tall and half as wide, encircled by a decorative stone frame.
>>

The mirror's stone frame glows with silvery, scintillating light as long as the moon dial's light or a *moonbeam* spell is illuminating the symbol of the full moon in area E5. While its frame is lit, the mirror functions like an ordinary *crystal ball*. Currently, the mirror is attuned to the white moose, which uses it to locate hunters and loggers it is familiar with. After clearing the snow covering the moon dial, the frost druid uses a *moonbeam* spell to light the full moon symbol on the moon dial's face, activating the mirror so the moose can use it. If the moose dies or another creature attunes to the mirror, the moose's attunement ends.

The mirror is held to the wall with *sovereign glue* and can't be removed without shattering it. Once broken, the mirror's magic is gone forever.

#### E8. First Tomb of the Half-Moon

The stone door to this tomb is engraved with a white semicircle (the symbol of a half-moon), with its rounded edge facing toward the right. The door is locked from the outside unless the light of the gnomon or a *moonbeam* spell illuminates one of the half-moon symbols on the moon dial in area E5. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the door. It pushes open easily from the inside.

>>This circular chamber has an intricately carved, domed ceiling twenty feet high. A beam of light shines down from the top of the dome, illuminating a rectangular stone sarcophagus.
>>

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/071-01-034.wolf.webp)

The light that shines down upon the sarcophagus is a minor magical effect that can be dispelled.

The sarcophagus's 350-pound lid can be lifted or pushed aside. Inside the sarcophagus is the withered corpse of an elf in tattered robes. As the sarcophagus is opened, the rush of air disturbs the cadaver's robes, which have mostly crumbled to dust. The sarcophagus also contains the following items:

- An unstrung bow
- Six silvered arrowheads
- A wooden cup with a winged fish etched into the side

#### E9. Second Tomb of the Half-Moon

The stone door to this tomb is engraved with a white semicircle (the symbol of a half-moon), with its rounded edge facing toward the left.

The door is locked from the outside unless the light of the gnomon or a *moonbeam* spell illuminates one of the half-moon symbols on the moon dial in area E5. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the door. It pushes open easily from the inside.

>>This circular chamber has an intricately carved domed ceiling twenty feet high. A beam of light shines down from the top of the dome, illuminating a rectangular stone sarcophagus. Someone has turned this tomb into living quarters, as evidenced by a rack of drying herbs and an unfurled bedroll behind the sarcophagus.
>>

The light that shines down on the sarcophagus is a minor magical effect that can be dispelled.

![Ravisin and an Awakened Shrub](img/adventure/IDRotF/072-01-035.ravisin.webp)

When she hears the door open, Ravisin the **frost druid** (see *appendix C*) ducks behind the sarcophagus. Hidden alongside her is an **awakened shrub** (a berry bush) that follows Ravisin everywhere, in case the druid gets hungry and wants some berries to munch on. Eating the berries has stained the druid's teeth blue.

The druid climbs onto the sarcophagus when characters enter the tomb and shouts, in Common, "Ten-Towns will be destroyedÃ¢ÂÂif not by my hand, then by the Frostmaiden's!" The druid then attacks, fighting to the death. If a character who has the Doppelganger secret (see *appendix B*) fails their saving throw against the druid's *moonbeam* spell, remember that the spell reveals the character's true (doppelganger) form.

When she is reduced to 0 hit points, Ravisin uses her last, gasping breath to say, "My beasts will avenge us!"

***Awakened Shrub.*** The **awakened shrub** is terrified of Ravisin and doubly frightened of fire. It fights only in self-defense. Growing on its branches are 2d20 tasty berries, which it allows characters to pick if they let it live. The shrub speaks Common and can share the following information once the frost druid is dealt with:

- Ravisin blamed Ten-Towners for the death of her twin sister, also a frost druid. (The shrub doesn't know how or when Ravisin's sister died.) Ravisin hides her sister's corpse in the sarcophagus.
- Ravisin *awakened* many beasts and plants throughout Icewind Dale. Some of them, such as the white moose, are of an evil bent. Others aren't. Ravisin often complained about the scruples of the plesiosaurus she awakened in Maer Dualdon (see "Lake Monster").
- Ravisin used *moonbeam* spells to trigger the moon dial, enabling the white moose to scry on loggers and hunters by using the magic mirror in area E7.

***Sarcophagus.*** The contents of an *herbalism kit* are spread across the top of the sarcophagus, which the druid uses as a worktable. The sarcophagus lid weighs 350 pounds, and moving it aside causes the tomb to fill with a horrible stench of decay.

The sarcophagus contains the rotting corpse of Ravisin's twin sister, Vurnis. Any character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check determines that her death occurred months ago, but the cold has slowed the decomposition of the body. A *speak with dead* spell cast on the corpse reveals that Vurnis was killed by hunters near Lonelywood.

***Treasure.*** Tucked under Vurnis's corpse is a sharkskin pouch that contains two potions in crystal vials: a *potion of resistance (radiant)* and a *potion of vitality*.

### Completing the Quest

Once they slay the awakened white moose, the characters can return to Lonelywood with proof of the moose's demise. After every three hours the characters spend in the forest, check for a random encounter using the *Lonelywood Forest Encounters table*.

If Ravisin the frost druid is not dealt with, Lonelywood is doomed to experience more of the same harassment from newly awakened beasts such as **polar bears**, **woolly rhinoceroses**, and **saber-toothed tigers**.

------

# Targos

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/073-01-036.shield-targos.webp)

Like Bryn Shander, Targos is encircled by a wooden wall, which helps to protect the town against orcs and other threats from the wilderness. The wall extends out into the lake, creating a safe harbor for the town's boats. But now Auril's long winter has frozen the water in the harbor, and many of Targos's boats are trapped in the ice. Fishers must drag their smaller vessels across the ice to get to the unfrozen lake beyond the harbor walls.

Almost all the towns in Icewind Dale make their living off the lakes, but nowhere is that fact more evident than in Targos. The town has always had the biggest fishing fleet and the biggest fishing industry, and everything that goes on here revolves around hauling the knucklehead trout out of Maer Dualdon. Auril's endless winter makes the work harder, but it gets done nonetheless.

Naerth Maxildanarr, a former rogue of Luskan, moved to Targos a couple of years ago, took up residence in the Luskan Arms, and spread around a lot of gold, earning the loyalty of many local fishers. His cordial, down-to-earth demeanor contributed to his swift rise to power, enabling him to replace a town speaker who was well liked but didn't want the job anymore. As the most senior representative of the Zhentarim in Ten-Towns, Naerth is determined to turn Icewind Dale into a trade hub for the Black Network. He has a dozen or more Zhentarim spies throughout Ten-Towns that he uses to good effect, disposing of suspected Harper spies and convincing business owners to buy fish from Targos instead of from other sources.

## Targos in a Nutshell

**Friendliness** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Services** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Comfort** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

***Available Quest.*** "Mountain Climb".

- **Population.** 1,000.

***Leaders.*** Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr (lawful evil human **spy**) is secretly a Zhentarim agent, who won the speakership because of his popularity with the fishers. Naerth is eager to secure a Zhentarim stranglehold on trade in Icewind Dale. A Zhent mercenary named Skath (lawful evil tiefling **veteran**) who is loyal to Naerth leads the town's militia.

***Militia.*** Targos can muster up to 200 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 16 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** A single-sailed, black ship (facing to the right) on a light blue field, representing the town's pride in its fishing fleet.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Humanoid (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivals.** Bremen, Lonelywood, Termalaine.

![Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr feeds his flying snakes while Captain Skath looks on](img/adventure/IDRotF/074-01-037.speaker-naerth.webp)

## Overland Travel

A snow-covered path connects Targos to Bryn Shander. A similar path sweeps around the east side of Maer Dualdon and leads to Termalaine. Travel times in the Overland Travel from Targos table assume that characters are on foot; mounts and dogsleds can shorten these times by as much as 50 percent.

There is no easy way to reach Bremen by land, since heavy snow has wiped out the trail that once led to it.

##### Overland Travel from Targos
|         To        | Travel Time |
|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
| Bremen (no trail) |   3 hours   |
|    Bryn Shander   |   2 hours   |
|     Termalaine    |   4 hours   |

## Locations in Targos

![Map 1.16: Targos](img/adventure/IDRotF/075-map-1.16-targos.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/076-map-1.16-targos-player.webp)The following locations marked on map 1.16 are likely to attract characters during their stay in Targos.

### The Luskan Arms

*Inn (and the town speaker's residence)*

The Luskan Arms is the oldest public house in Ten-Towns, established back when Bryn Shander was still just "the camp on the hill" and Luskan was a thriving city. Many of the traders who came to Targos in those days hailed from Luskan, so the Luskan Arms was built to look like an inn that might be found in the City of Sails. As a result, much of the decor is nearly two hundred years old, reflecting Luskan as it was in the years before its decline. The inn has sturdy walls but rotten floorboards, and drafts come up into the common room from the cellar. The place is also infested with rats, which scurry between the walls at all hours of the night. The proprietor, Owenn Tarsenel (neutral human **commoner**), is a quiet, balding man who has sunk into a deep depression, fearing that summer will never return to Icewind Dale.

The largest guest suite in the Luskan Arms is occupied by the town speaker, Naerth Maxildanarr, who likes the inn because it reminds him of home and is a great place to meet visitors. Caged in his room are three **flying snakes** that he uses to deliver messages to his spies.

### Three Flags Sailing

*Tavern*

Fishers come here after a long day for a bowl of stew and a quick pint before heading to bed. The atmosphere is subdued; the fishers are cold and tired and unsure about Icewind Dale's future. The tavern is run by a plump, gray-haired widow named Ethen Yarbroul (neutral good human **commoner**), better known as "Ma." She fusses over the fishers as if they were her children.

Characters who hang out in the tavern are likely to hear a rumor or two, which you can determine by rolling on the Ten-Towns Rumors table (See "Ten-Towns Rumors").

### Triglio

*General store*

Triglio takes its name from one of the chanteys that the fishers of Targos sing when they are hard at work: *"Trig-lee-oh, lads, an' 'oist upon the line/Trig-lee-oh, lads, an' bring yon fishers in."* The store's proprietor is Jestin Hunrae (neutral good human **commoner**), a scarecrow-like fellow who fished the lake until his left hand was crushed in a collision with a boat from Termalaine. The only items he doesn't sell are fishing and sailing supplies; in Targos, such goods are supplied by specialty crafters and merchants. All other common gear, including fishing poles and snowshoes, can be bought here.

## Mountain Climb

The characters can pick up this quest if they start the adventure in Targos or shortly after they arrive in town. It begins when they see a sled dog running through the street. The dog belonged to Garret Velryn, a wilderness guide who led a small expedition up Kelvin's Cairn. The dog is agitated and tries to lead the characters to Garret's house. Garret's husband, Keegan, is alarmed to see the dog without its master and fears for Garret's life. He asks the characters to head toward Kelvin's Cairn, find Garret, and see him safely back to Targos.

### Getting the Quest

>>As you trudge through town, snow crunching underneath your feet, you hear the bark of a dog over the whistle of the wind. A wolf-sized sled dog with light gray fur runs toward you, dragging a broken leather harness behind it.
>>

The dog (use the **wolf** stat block), whose name is Boy, has clearly broken free of its sled and is friendly. It tackles the nearest character and whimpers as it licks that character's face. Then, using every communication tactic at its disposal, it tries to lead the party to its master's house a few blocks away, grabbing a character by the bootstrap and tugging the character in the direction it wants the party to go.

If the characters follow the dog, it leads them to the front door of a modest dwelling. The dog barks and scratches at the door. Keegan Velryn (neutral good human **commoner**), a handsome man in his thirties, opens the door, and the dog races inside. When Keegan sees the characters instead of his husband, his smile fades as he urges the characters to come inside, where he gives each of them a cup of warm cider and shares the following information:

>>"I was born in Ten-Towns, but my husband came from a wealthy family in Neverwinter. Garret didn't care for city life. When I met him, he was working as a guide. He loves the outdoors, and he lives to climb mountains.
>>
>>"A few days ago, Garret was hired by some adventurers to lead them up the slopes of Kelvin's Cairn. Garret's plan was to take the adventurers to Caer-Konig, the town at the foot of Kelvin's Cairn. After they acquired some climbing gear from the outfitter there, he was to lead them up the mountain. Garret took six dogs and a sled with him. Boy, here, was Garret's favorite. Raised him from a pup. Boy would never leave Garret's side unless something terrible had happened."
>>

Keegan didn't meet the adventurers who hired Garret, so he doesn't know how many there are. At this point in the conversation, Keegan asks the characters to find his missing husband:

>>"It's a lot to ask, but could I persuade you to go up there and find Garret and his companions? I don't have money, but the proprietor of the Luskan Arms is a friend of mine. I could get you some free rooms at the inn. I'm also a scrimshander by trade and can give you some of my artwork. It's not worth much, I confess."
>>

Keegan has a lot of faith in Garret's survival skills, which is why he honestly believes Garret might still be alive. If the characters accept this quest, Keegan suggests they visit Frozenfar Expeditions in Caer-Konig (see "Frozenfar Expeditions"), which is likely the last place anyone would have seen Garret before he went up the mountain. If the characters want to take Boy with them, Keegan won't protest.

### Journey to Kelvin's Cairn

The characters can either travel to Caer-Konig first, then go west toward Kelvin's Cairn, or they can head straight to the mountain by cutting across the open tundra and passing through the Dwarven Valley. Both options are discussed below.

#### Targos to Caer-Konig

Sticking to trails and roads, the characters can safely reach Caer-Konig in 14ÃÂ½ hours on foot. The trip begins with a 3-mile jaunt to Bryn Shander, continues with an exhausting 23-mile journey to Caer-Dineval, and ends with a 3-mile hike around Lac Dinneshere to Caer-Konig. Characters can reduce the total travel time to 7 hours if they use dogsleds.

As the characters pass through Bryn Shander, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig, they can pick up each town's starting quest if they haven't gotten them already.

Atenas Swift, the owner of Frozenfar Expeditions in Caer-Konig, tells the characters that Garret showed up with three well-armed companions (a male goliath, a female lightfoot halfling, and a female tiefling), helped them buy climbing gear and camping supplies, and then headed to the Hook, Line, and Sinker (the local tavern) for drinks, with plans to get a good night's rest at the Northern Light (the local inn). The proprietors of these establishments have no complaints about Garrett and his retinue, who looked tired and didn't talk much.

If the party doesn't have anyone who's good at tracking, the characters can hire Jarthra Farzassh (see "Frozenfar Expeditions") as a guide.

#### Targos to Kelvin's Cairn

By crossing open tundra, the characters can travel directly from Targos to Kelvin's Cairn, covering 12 miles in 24 hours on foot. They can halve the travel time if they use dogsleds.

When the characters reach the halfway point in their journey, they come across a potential obstacle. Use the "Random Wilderness Encounters" section in chapter 2 to determine the nature of the encounter and if it occurs during a blizzard.

As the characters pass through the Dwarven Valley, they might (if the weather is clear) see evidence of dwarf activity, such as tracks that lead up to tunnels carved into the valley's slopes. Several hundred shield dwarves live in subterranean halls that connect to these mines, but they rarely venture to the surface nowadays except to forage and hunt. Characters can find refuge among the dwarves, who are civil if not friendly, but must leave within a day or two, since the dwarves have little food to spare and are too busy to entertain guests for any longer than that. Characters who have completed the "Foaming Mugs" quest however, have earned the dwarves' favor and are welcome to stay as long as they like.

### Climbing Kelvin's Cairn

![Map 1.17: Kelvin's Cairn](img/adventure/IDRotF/077-map-1.17-kelvins-cairn.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/078-map-1.17-kelvins-cairn-player.webp)Map 1.17 shows the route that Garret's expedition took up Kelvin's Cairn. It leads not to the topmost peak of the mountain, but to the summit of one of its spurs.

Before they can follow their quarry up Kelvin's Cairn, the characters must locate Garret's base camp at the foot of the mountain. Jarthra Farzassh can lead them there, since she recommended the location to Garret before his expedition left Caer-Konig. Garret's sled dog can also lead characters straight to the base camp. Without help of any sort, the characters can spend 8 hours searching for the camp on their own, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) group check. If the group check fails, they can repeat it after another 8 hours of looking.

#### Base Camp

>>You see two tents pitched in the snow near an icy outcropping that acts as a natural windbreaker. Between the tents is an overturned sled. Still harnessed to the sled are five howling dogs.
>>

Garret's dog, Boy, tore free of its harness and ran back to Targos to get help, leaving the other five sled dogs (use the **wolf** stat block) behind. The dogs are friendly, cold, hungry, and miserable. If the characters release them, the dogs run back to the nearest town to seek shelter.

Under the sled are two small crates. One is empty, and it appears that the dogs broke into it and ate the provisions that were contained within; the other is not in the dogs' reach and contains enough rations to feed four people for three days.

***Starting the Ascent.*** The wind has obliterated the tracks made by Garret's expedition, but characters can discern the likeliest route the climbers took. This route is marked on map 1.17, and characters who follow it experience the following sequence of encounters.

If Boy is with the party, the dog can lead the characters to Garret (see "Fallen Climber").

#### Mountain Goats

>>The howling wind, blowing snow, and slippery ice make the climb treacherous. Ahead, you see four mountain goats perched on a large rock formation around which you must navigate.
>>

The four **mountain goats** (see *appendix C*) are indifferent toward the characters and bleat loudly as the party draws near. The goats turn hostile if the characters attack them.

#### Avalanche

>>Hundreds of feet up the mountain, you come to a glistening white expanse of packed snow. As you get about halfway across it, you hear a loud crack from higher up the mountain, followed by a rumbling noise as the ground starts to shake. It's an avalanche!
>>

The party finds itself in the path of an avalanche (see "Avalanches"). The avalanche is 200 feet wide, 100 feet long, and 30 feet deep.

To run this event, first determine the marching order of the party and how far apart the characters are. Assume that the rearmost party member is directly below the avalanche, which means that character must move at least 100 feet to get clear of the avalanche's path. Next, have all party members roll initiative.

The avalanche starts 500 feet above the party and sweeps down to the base of the mountain 1,000 feet below. The avalanche moves 300 feet on initiative count 10 and another 300 feet on initiative count 0.

#### Fallen Climber

>>You reach a steep, snow-covered incline dotted with jagged rocks. Lying facedown in the snow, barely conscious, is a humanoid in bloodstained cold weather clothing.
>>

The figure in the snow is Garret Velryn (neutral good human **scout**), a rugged, bearded man in his prime. He has one level of exhaustion and 6 hit points remaining. In addition to his weapons, he carries a climber's kit. His other equipment is lost. If the characters have Boy with them, the dog and Garret become inseparable.

If the characters tend to his wounds, Garret comes around and tells them that a yeti surprised him and his companions higher up the mountain. He lured the yeti away from the others and got it to chase him down the mountain. The yeti wounded him seriously, but he escaped with his life when the monster stopped following him.

***Hunters of Men.*** As the characters tend to Garret, two **crag cats** (see *appendix C*) move to within 20 feet of the party and attack, each one pouncing on a randomly determined party member. Known to Ten-Towners as "Hunters of Men," the crag cats caught Garret's scent but failed to reach him before the characters showed up. Characters with passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of 17 or higher are not surprised by the crag cats. If one crag cat dies, the other one disengages from melee combat and tries to flee down the mountain on its next turn.

***Development.*** Assuming he survives the encounter with the crag cats, Garret makes it known that he wants to find the other members of the expedition and assumes (correctly) that they're still up the mountain. He aims to find them but can be persuaded to return to Targos if the characters restore all his lost hit points and vow to search for the three missing members on his behalf. Garret describes the missing explorers as follows:

- Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi, a male goliath warrior determined to find Oyaminartok and test his mettle against her
- Perilou Fishfinger, a female lightfoot halfling follower of Yondalla (halfling god of fertility and protection) and Mokingo's stalwart companion
- Astrix, a female tiefling who mumbles and swears a lot (Garret doesn't know what her story is)

#### Perilous Climb

At this point, the characters must zigzag their way up the mountain, clinging to narrow ledges and scaling icy cliffs. To pass all these obstacles, the party must make three successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) group checks. If a group check fails, the party wastes 1 hour making no progress, and each party member who failed the check gains one level of exhaustion.

![A mountain climber meets his doom on the slopes of Kelvin's Cairn](img/adventure/IDRotF/079-01-038.mountain-climber.webp)

#### Frozen Cave

A character with the Littlest Yeti secret (see *appendix B*) can really shine in this encounter.

>>Up ahead on your left is a fifteen-foot-high, ten-foot-wide cave mouth. There's blood on the snow some distance from the cave entrance.
>>

The blood marks the area where Garret's expedition was ambushed by a male yeti that was hidden under a snowdrift near the cave entrance. It lunged at Garret, raking him with its claws and biting into his shoulder. Mokingo the goliath came to Garret's defense but didn't last long. Perilou hid in the cave as Astrix fled up the mountain. The yeti pursued Garret some distance down the mountain before abandoning the chase and returning to the cave.

The cave is home to a mated pair of **yetis** and their child, a **yeti tyke** (see *appendix C*). Mother and child are both inside; the father is out hunting but returns shortly with a fresh kill. The cave's interior is shown on map 1.17.

***F1. Chasm.*** This cave has a 20-foot-high, concave roof. Most of the floor has fallen away, forming a chasm 80 feet deep. All that's left of the floor is a rocky ledge connected to area F2 by a natural stone bridge that's safe to cross. A 1-foot-thick sheet of ice spans the southern part of the chasm. Characters can walk across this ice to avoid area F2 and go directly to area F3.

A character can also try to collapse the ice sheet by dealing damage to it. The ice sheet has AC 13, 30 hit points, and immunity to cold, psychic, and poison damage; if reduced to 0 hit points, the ice sheet fractures and falls into the chasm. Any creature standing on the ice sheet when it begins to collapse must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed check, the creature falls into the chasm, taking 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a success, the creature lunges and leaps to land on one side of the chasm or the other (its choice) and doesn't fall.

***F2. Trophies.*** The floor of this 10-foot-high tunnel is strewn with the bones of Mokingo Growling Bear, whose dead body was dragged here. Bits of flesh still cling to the bones. The head has been ripped from its shoulders, gnawed, and stuffed in a niche dug out of the wall. Amid the goliath's bones are torn bits of hide armor, a greataxe, and the skulls and bones of three mountain goats. Seven other crude niches in the walls hold the frozen heads of humanoids previously decapitated by the yetis. One belongs to a dwarf named Oobok (see "Foaming Mugs"). Another belongs to a dwarf named Barthoom, who was killed farther up the mountain a month ago (see "Ruined Camp").

***F3. Yeti Den.*** The floor of this cave is 5 feet higher than in area F2, and it has an uneven ceiling that ranges in height from 10 to 20 feet. The floor drops off sharply to the south, forming a 10-foot-high ledge that overlooks the entrance to a tunnel. In the passageway is a short flight of steps that ascend to the south.

This cave contains a strange sight: a female adult **yeti** watching her child, a **yeti tyke** (see *appendix C*), as it plays with a lightfoot halfling dressed in cold weather clothing and curled up in the fetal position. The halfling is Perilou Fishfinger (neutral good lightfoot halfling **acolyte** of Yondalla). The yeti tyke is knocking her around like a ball, and it's clear from her cries that Perilou is still alive. She has three levels of exhaustion but is otherwise unharmed.

The appearance of intruders terrifies the yeti tyke, which crawls up onto its mother's back to get away from them. The mother lets out a roar, hoping to scare off the intruders without a fight. She won't endanger herself or her child by attacking the characters if they also refrain from combat and get it across to her that they've come to rescue the halfling.

Perilou thanks her rescuers but is sad to have witnessed the death of her goliath friend, Mokingo. She doesn't know what became of her other companion, Astrix (see "Ruined Camp" below), and would love to answer that question before returning to Ten-Towns. Perilou stays with the characters until they return to Ten-Towns, then parts ways with them after deciding that her adventuring days are over.

Against one wall, hidden under the shattered remains of a dogsled, is a mess kit, an explorer's pack, and enough blood-spattered heavy clothing to make two cold weather outfits.

***Development.*** As the characters leave the yeti cave, the male adult **yeti** returns home with a dead mountain goat tucked under one arm. Under normal circumstances, the male yeti is hostile, but a character with the Littlest Yeti secret (see *appendix B*) can improve the yeti's attitude. If no one has this secret but the characters have the yeti tyke with them, they can trade the tyke for safe passage up or down the mountain.

![Here lie the bodies of Astrix the tiefling and an ill-fated mountaineer known only as Blue Boots](img/adventure/IDRotF/080-01-039.astrix.webp)

#### Ruined Camp

>>You come to the edge of a vast and deep crevasse, with nowhere to go but down. A collapsed tent lies half-buried in the snow near the precipice. Jutting out of a nearby snowbank is a pair of blue leather boots. Next to this grim display, a figure in cold weather clothing sits in the snow, her knees pulled in tight to her chest. Horns protrude from underneath the figure's fur-lined hood.
>>

The figure seated in the snow is Astrix, a tiefling wizard. She is deadÃ¢ÂÂfrozen solid with her teeth clenched and her eyes staring at the blue boots sticking out of the snow. She escaped immediate death at the hands of the yeti but, in her panic, fled up the mountain rather than down it. Unwilling to approach the yeti cave again too soon, Astrix took refuge here. The sight of the boots made her sink into utter despair, until the elements finally claimed her.

***Blue Boots.*** A shield dwarf explorer named Barthoom Hammerhome climbed to this great height and made camp here a month ago, only to be killed and decapitated by a yeti. The half-buried tent is his. Characters who tug on his blue leather boots can pull Barthoom's headless body from the snowbank. Characters who search the dwarf's body find an empty wineskin, a half-eaten block of goat's cheese, and a miner's pick.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search Astrix's body find a *potion of invisibility* and a leather-bound *spellbook*, which contains the following wizard spells: *alter self*, *cloud of daggers*, *comprehend languages*, *detect magic*, *expeditious retreat*, *scorching ray*, *shield*, *suggestion*, and *Tenser's floating disk*.

### Concluding the Quest

The trip back to Targos can be as fraught or as uneventful as you wish. If the characters take the more direct but dangerous route across the open tundra, they have at least one random encounter in the wilderness (see "Wilderness Encounters").

Keegan and Garret are happy to be reunited. The characters still receive their promised reward if Garret dies, but only if they deliver his body to Keegan for a proper burial. Part of their reward is a wooden box containing four scrimshaw figurines worth 10 gp each: a spouting whale, a smiling fox, a pair of dancing hares, and a walrus with the words "BIG LOVE" carved into it.

# Termalaine

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/081-01-040.termalaine.webp)

Founded by Calishite settlers who appreciated beauty, Termalaine is widely regarded as the most picturesque town in Icewind Dale, spreading out from the shore of Maer Dualdon and bordered on the north and west by tall pines. Its buildings incorporate carvings of wizards, homunculi, tigers, and smiling djinn.

For most visitors, the enchantment of the town is dispelled as soon as they feel the icy claws and teeth of the cold wind sweeping down from the north, shearing through their layers of clothing. Termalaine was built in the path of this dreadful gale, which continues well past the town to harry fishers on the southern half of the lake.

In addition to fishers, shipbuilders, and scrimshanders, Termalaine is home to miners who harvest gemstones from a cavern complex set into a low hill north and east of the settlement. Their efforts are hampered by creatures from the Underdark that occasionally find their way up into the mine. Whenever such creatures are discovered, the mine is sealed off and the townsfolk wait until a band of sellswords or adventurers can be hired to clear it out.

## Termalaine in a Nutshell

**Friendliness** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Services** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ**Comfort** Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ

***Available Quest.*** "A Beautiful Mine".

- **Population.** 600.

***Leader.*** Oarus Masthew (lawful good half-orc **scout**) was declared speaker after a close and contentious election. The child of half-orc adventurers, he was adopted by Shaelen Masthew, the previous speaker, who retired from her leadership role but still lives in Termalaine. Oarus is bright, with a sharp sense of humor, but he has political enemies in town and lacks the full support of the town militia.

***Militia.*** Termalaine can muster up to 50 soldiers (use the **tribal warrior** stat block) and 4 **veterans**.

- **Heraldry.** The open-mouthed head of a fish at the bottom of a sky-blue field, its jaws parted as it swallows a large rose-pink oval. The oval is a tourmaline, symbolic of the town's gem mining.

***Sacrifice to Auril.*** Warmth (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

- **Rivals.** Bremen, Lonelywood, Targos.

## Overland Travel

Snow-covered paths connect Termalaine to Lonelywood and Targos, its closest neighbors. Travel times in the Overland Travel from Termalaine table assume that characters are on foot; mounts and dogsleds can shorten these times by as much as 50 percent.

##### Overland Travel from Termalaine
|     To     | Travel Time |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Lonelywood |   2 hours   |
|   Targos   |   4 hours   |

## Locations in Termalaine

![Map 1.18: Termalaine](img/adventure/IDRotF/082-map-1.18-termalaine.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/083-map-1.18-termalaine-player.webp)The following locations are marked on map 1.18.

### The Blue Clam

*Dockside tavern*

The fishers of Termalaine typically finish their days here, seated on benches near one of the building's long hearths to warm their feet while they fill their bellies with spiced chowder. Beautiful works of scrimshaw are hung on the walls.

Vernon Braig (neutral good half-orc **commoner**), the Blue Clam's owner and chef, knows some of the hunters and trappers in Lonelywood, and occasionally a sled comes down the north trail with a sack of hares or a haunch of moose, courtesy of one of Vernon's friends. On those nights, the Blue Clam's hearths are full of roasting meat, and the patrons stay later and sing louder, enjoying the good times while they last.

Characters who loiter in the tavern are likely to hear a rumor or two, which you can determine by rolling on the Ten-Towns Rumors table (see "Ten-Towns Rumors").

### The Eastside

*Inn*

The Eastside is where most visitors in town stay. What looks from the outside like separate houses turns out to be a single structure with rooms connected by underground passages, with cozy guest accommodations in the cellar.

The innkeeper is Marta Peskryk (lawful good human **commoner**), a willowy teenager who spends much of her time tending to her bedridden father, Clyde, a retired fisherman and noncombatant. As she performs her daily chores, Marta sings the following song to herself:

>Ahead of winter's wind she cameÃ¢ÂÂ
>
>The lovely woman with no name;
>
>Draped in a fur-lined cloak of red,
>
>To the icy lake she fled;
>
>The wind pursued her all the sameÃ¢ÂÂ
>
>As sure as night she's dead.
>

If asked about the song, Marta recounts the following tale. Fifty years ago, a mysterious woman in a fur-lined red cloak stopped at the Eastside on her way to Lonelywood. Because the woman was alone and frightened, the innkeepersÃ¢ÂÂa pair of retired adventurers who happened to be Marta's grandparentsÃ¢ÂÂtried to console her. The woman gave them a ring as payment for their hospitality. Not long afterward, a howling wind burst into the inn and tossed the woman about like a rag doll. The innkeepers intervened, giving the woman time to escape. The evil wind battered Marta's grandparents unconscious before resuming its hunt. That was the last anyone saw of the woman.

***Treasure.*** Marta wears the mysterious woman's ring (which she has inherited) around her neck on a chain. It is a *ring of warmth*, and Marta will part with it only if she can be convinced that it can help bring an end to the wintry curse that besets Icewind Dale.

## A Beautiful Mine

The characters can pick up this quest if they start the adventure in Termalaine or shortly after they arrive in town. As they trudge through the streets, they see a young boy standing on a box, yelling about various local happenings, including the recent evacuation of workers from a nearby mine that has been overrun by kobolds. A reward of 50 gp is offered to anyone who can rid the mine of the pesky dragonlings.

When the characters investigate, they discover that all is not what it seems. The kobold leader has been possessed by a ghost, and a grell has infiltrated the mine, setting the kobolds on edge. The characters can either try to parley with the kobolds and get them to leave the mine peacefully, or they can rid Ten-Towns of their presence permanently and try to deal with the grell on their own.

### A Minor Issue

Darmo Mazlu, a human boy, stands on a box and yells out the latest news to passersby, most of whom ignore him:

>>A boy wrapped in heavy winter clothes shouts the news of the day as people pass by. When you approach, the boy cries, "The gemstone mine is closed because of monsters! Speaker Masthew is offering fifty gold to anyone who clears it out!"
>>

If the characters express interest, Darmo tells them they can find the town speaker, Oarus Masthew, at the Blue Clam. The boy also has some information about the mine, including its location. He doesn't know much about the history or the particulars of the mine, but he knows it's important for Termalaine and its closing means a significant loss of income.

The characters can make the half-hour trek to the mine without visiting Oarus, or they can go to the tavern to see the speaker. If the characters decide to ignore the quest, the mine remains closed for several weeks before the kobolds mysteriously vanish, enabling the miners to return. After the mine reopens, it isn't long before workers start disappearing one by oneÃ¢ÂÂvictims of the grell.

### Getting the Quest

When the characters arrive at the Blue Clam, read:

>>Outside the tavern, you see two bundled-up humanoids talking to one another. When they see you, one waves to you in a friendly manner, then says, "You seem entirely too prepared for trouble. Are you here about the mine?"
>>

The town speaker, Oarus Masthew (lawful good half-orc **veteran**), explains that a group of kobolds crept into the mine a few days ago, entering from the surface and forcing the miners to abandon their jobs. No one was killed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. He also reveals that a human miner went missing a few days before the kobolds showed up, prompting other miners to fear that a monster must have crawled up from the Underdark. Oarus thinks it's possible that the miner fell down the central shaft, which is deep enough that his body would never be found.

One piece of information that Oarus fails to mention is that he ordered the town militia to clear out the mine three days ago. The militia refused to deal with the problem for what amounts to political reasons. Senior officers in cahoots with Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos are determined to oust Masthew as town speaker and replace him with one of their own in a special election. They're convinced that the closing of the mine and the resulting economic woes will turn Masthew's political supporters against him.

### Approaching the Mine

The entrance to the mine is in the woods northeast of town. The characters can follow a trail from Termalaine and be there in 30 minutes. When they arrive, the area around the opening appears devoid of life:

>>The entrance to the gem mine is an open tunnel in a hillside. Empty carts are parked near the entrance, next to which a crude wooden sign has been propped up. Written on the sign in charcoal are the words "Kobolds only!" in Common.
>>

The words are written in more elaborate calligraphy than would be expected from a kobold.

#### Mine Features

The mine's meandering tunnels have 7-foot-high ceilings. Wider areas tend to have higher ceilings, the average being 12 feet. The mine has no light sources.

The most prominent feature of the mine is a wide vertical shaft that descends thousands of feet into the Underdark. This shaft predates the mine, and efforts to seal it off have been unsuccessful. It was by this route that the grell invaded the mine in search of food.

#### Captured Kobolds

Characters who capture a kobold in the mine can, without an ability check, learn some or all of the following information in the course of an interrogation:

- "Trex led us here. He has wings like dragon!"
- "Trex smart! He speaks like human who knows a lot. He don't speak Dragon no more."
- "Trex says miners want their mine back. Trex wants something better in return."
- "Trex says we be safer in town. There's food in town!"

### Mine Locations

![Map 1.19: Gem Mine](img/adventure/IDRotF/085-map-1.19-gem-mine.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/086-map-1.19-gem-mine-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.19. The mine is made up of three levels, the deepest of which is level 3. The boxed text in these locations assumes the characters can see what's around them.

#### M1. Tool Room

Rough-hewn steps descend 60 feet before ending just north of this chamber.

>>Racks holding picks and hammers are nailed to the walls of this small cavern. The floor is covered with rock dust and tracks.
>>

Any character who examines the tracks and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies reptilian footprints mingled with human tracks, as well as a set of tracks that look like they belong to a pair of giant rodents. The reptilian (kobold) tracks fan out, leading to areas M2, M3, and M4. The rodent (giant rat) tracks lead to area M2, and from there to area M3.

#### M2. Gem Deposits

>>The floor in the east end of this dusty cave is five feet higher than in the west end, with a rocky ridge separating the two areas except for slopes on either side. Picks and shovels lean against the ridge. Small gem deposits in the ridge and the walls of the cave gleam seductively.
>>

***Treasure.*** If a character using a miner's pick spends an hour chipping away at the walls, roll percentile dice and consult the Mining Discoveries table to determine what, if anything, the character unearths. The tourmalines found in the mine are translucent gemstones that come in different colors, including pale green, blue, pink, red, brown, and black.

##### Mining Discoveries
|  d100 | Discovery                                 |
|:-----:|-------------------------------------------|
| 01Ã¢ÂÂ80 | Nothing                                   |
| 81Ã¢ÂÂ95 | Pebble-sized tourmaline (1 gp)            |
| 96Ã¢ÂÂ99 | Acorn-sized tourmaline, flawed (10 gp)    |
|   00  | Acorn-sized tourmaline, unflawed (100 gp) |

#### M3. River Cavern

Characters hear the sound of rushing water as they approach this cave.

>>An underground river flows through the far side of this cavern, which is supported by a natural stone pillar near the water's edge. Between you and the river are two halfling-sized gray rodents with long tails and beady eyes. They rush to attack as soon as you notice them.
>>

The two **giant rats** are aggressive, giving chase if the characters run away.

***Underground River.*** Thermal vents keep this river of fresh water from freezing. The river exits the cave through a 2ÃÂ½-foot-wide fissure in the south wall, gaining speed as it moves through the narrow passage toward area M5. Any Medium or smaller creature that wades into this fissure or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be swept away by the current and dropped into the shaft that plunges thousands of feet into the Underdark. Such a fall is fatal.

#### M4. Processing Room

The floor of the western tunnel from area M1 is 7 feet higher than the floor of the cavern it leads to. The ledge can be easily climbed in either direction. Use the boxed text to describe the cave's other features:

>>Benches and tables are set up as workspaces where miners clean any gemstones they find. Gravel and pebbles are strewn on the ground. Scattered across the floor are a few hammers, picks, and broken lanterns.
>>

The miners were forced to leave this area in a hurry when the kobolds showed up and drove them out.

***Treasure.*** If the characters search the cave, they find a small figurine of a dog carved out of rock, with two pebble-sized tourmalines for eyes. It was made by a miner while on break. The figurine is worth 10 gp.

#### M5. Underdark Shaft, Level 1

>>Wooden planks and struts form a walkway along the wall of a seemingly bottomless vertical shaft. A narrow waterfall cascades down the northeast wall, and the sound of rushing water is loud in the confined space.
>>

Characters using darkvision or a light source brighter than a candle can see more walkways attached to the northwest side of the shaft 30 feet farther down. Because of the loud waterfall, characters must yell if they want to communicate with each other while in this area.

***Kobold Saboteurs.*** The cascading water drowns out the noise made by two **Icewind kobolds** (see appendix C) that are clinging to the underside of the walkway. These kobolds, named Scorp and Thwip, are using saws to weaken the wooden struts so that the walkway will collapse if a creature weighing more than two kobolds tries to stand on it. These kobolds need another day to complete their sabotage; until then, the walkway is safe.

The characters can't hear the kobolds, but if they look underneath the planks, they can see the kobolds working away cheerily. If a kobold takes damage while clinging to the underside of the walkway, it loses its grip and falls down the shaft to its death.

#### M6. Bucket Lift

>>A wooden pulley system has been constructed around a large hole in the floor. A bucket big enough to hold a humanoid is held up by thick rope. Three alcoves next to the lift contain wooden boards and mining equipment.
>>

The bucket lift is used for hoisting miners and ore between levels 1 and 2. It's controlled by using a crank inside the bucket or the crank on the side of the pulley system. The bucket can hold one Medium creature or two Small creatures at a time. It runs from here to area M7, 15 feet farther down, and back again. It takes 1 minute for the bucket to be lowered or raised.

![The true monster of the mine reveals itself](img/adventure/IDRotF/087-01-042.grell.webp)

#### M7. Bucket Lift Landing

>>The mechanism creaks as the bucket lift descends to the floor of a small cave where two dusty tunnels lead in opposite directions.
>>

Characters who search for tracks in the dust and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can determine that a lot of kobold foot traffic leads to and comes from the west, and a single set of kobold footprints leads to the east. (The kobold who wandered in that direction never returned.)

#### M8. Grell Lair

>>A hole in the west side of this chamber opens into the central shaft, letting in the sound of the waterfall. The floor in the north end of the cave is five feet higher than in the south end, with a rocky ridge separating them and a slope on either side leading to the top of the ridge. The walls above the ridge gleam with gem deposits.
>>

Floating near the 15-foot-high ceiling is a **grell**. A character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher notices the grell. If more than one character enters the cavern, the grell won't attack and tries to stay hidden. If the characters leave the cave, it follows them, always staying at least 30 feet away. When an opportunity to attack a lone party member presents itself, the grell swoops in and tries to paralyze its prey, then hauls its catch back here to be devoured. After it feeds, it drops the remains of its victim down the central shaft.

***Treasure.*** If a character using a miner's pick spends an hour chipping away at the walls above the ridge, roll percentile dice and consult the Mining Discoveries table (see area M2) to determine what, if anything, is found.

#### M9. Hungry Kobolds

>>A table and chairs are set up in this area to create a space for the miners to take breaks. On top of the table, two kobolds are poking a giant rat with their javelins to make sure it's dead. The kobolds screech loudly as they notice you.
>>

Two **Icewind kobolds** (see appendix C) named Grek and Smol rush to attack when the characters enter the cave. If either one is injured, they immediately have a change of heart and flee through the tunnel to the north that leads to level 3.

#### M10. Underdark Shaft, Level 3

>>The tunnel's downward slope ends where it opens onto the center shaft. A wooden walkway extends from this opening and then runs westward to another tunnel in the rock. In front of you, a large bucket like the one you saw earlier dangles from a taut rope that stretches southward across the shaft and is connected to another wooden platform 15 feet away.
>>

Looking down, the characters see nothing but darkness. Characters using darkvision or a light source brighter than a candle can see, if they look up, the underside of the walkway in area M5 (on level 1). If the characters failed to notice the two kobolds clinging to the underside of the upper structure earlier, they spot the little saboteurs from this 30-foot-lower vantage point.

***Bucket Shuttle.*** This rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to transport miners and ore between the two platforms. A crank mounted to each platform allows the bucket to be shuttled from one side to the other. A person inside the bucket can forgo the cranks and pull themselves across by tugging on the suspension rope. The bucket is large enough to hold one Medium creature or two Small creatures. It takes 1 round for the bucket to cross the gap between the platforms.

Dealing 5 acid, fire, or slashing damage to the rope causes it to snap. If the rope is cut, the bucket and its contents fall down the shaft, likely gone forever. A character in the bucket when the rope breaks can grab one end of the severed rope with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, thus averting certain death.

#### M11. Kobold Tunnels

>>Lurking in this dusty tunnel are three skittish kobolds. One of them carries a threadbare satchel and wears a fake pair of dragon wings made of thin wood and tattered white cloth. This kobold immediately raises its hands in surrender, saying in Common, "We mean you no harm. Please don't hurt us."
>>

Two of these three **Icewind kobolds** (see appendix C) are nervous bodyguards named Vott and Zurk. The one wearing the fake wings and doing the talking is Trex, the leader of the group. If one or both of the kobolds from area M9 fled from there, they lurk deeper inside the tunnel behind Trex and his bodyguards.

Trex is possessed by a **ghost**, though the characters won't know this until the ghost shows itself (see "Janth's Ghost" below). Speaking in fluent Common, Trex explains that he and his fellow kobolds sought refuge in the mine after being chased out of the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn by a yeti. The miners got scared and ran off before Trex could explain that the kobolds meant no harm. As long as Trex is possessed by the ghost, he has an impressive vocabulary and speaks only Common.

If the characters engage Trex in conversation, he makes a proposition:

>>"The everlasting winter has made the wilderness unsafe for my kind, and the preternatural cold dulls our wits. Please, we only want a place to stay so we can keep out of this horrible weather. We can work, and we won't cause trouble. Termalaine would be richer for having us."
>>

Any character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that Trex is lying. The ghost controlling Trex wants safe access to Termalaine so that it can possess someone more powerful and influential than a kobold.

If the characters agree to take the kobolds in the mine back to Termalaine, the kobolds act as their allies.

![Trex](img/adventure/IDRotF/088-01-043.trex.webp)

***Janth's Ghost.*** In life, Janth Alowar was a neutral human sage who devoted himself by cataloguing the flora of Icewind Dale. He and his guide were killed and decapitated by a yeti in the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn two years ago, and his restless spirit has lingered. The kobolds happened upon the ghost while searching for shelter during a blizzard, allowing it to possess Trex without the other kobolds' knowledge.

The threadbare satchel carried by Trex once belonged to Janth. It contains clumps of moss, lichen, and shrubbery gathered from the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn and the surrounding tundra. None of the samples are valuable, but the ghost is very possessive of the collection and won't give up its satchel without a fight.

Janth's ghost can be laid to rest by destroying the satchelÃ¢ÂÂits last connection to the Material Plane. The ghost otherwise remains as close to the satchel as possible. If the satchel is taken from Trex and discarded, the ghost forsakes its current host and remains near the satchel, hoping to possess someone else.

If Trex is killed, the ghost appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the kobold's body. On its next turn, the ghost tries to possess one of the charactersÃ¢ÂÂpreferably one who can take up its satchel.

#### M12. Fossilized Skull and Psi Crystal

>>A fossilized skull partially juts out of the east wall of this small cave, five feet off the ground. The skull has larger than normal eye sockets, a curious ridge between the eyes, nothing that would pass for a nose, and four small holes where one would expect to see teeth.
>>

The skull embedded in the wall is that of a mind flayer that came up from the Underdark thousands of years ago. How it became lodged in the stone is anyone's guess. Any character who examines the skull and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check concludes that it came from a mind flayer. Any attempt to pry the skull from the stone causes it to shatter and fall away, revealing a crystal shard where the illithid's brain would have been.

***Treasure.*** The crystal shard lodged inside the fossilized mind flayer skull is a *psi crystal* (see *appendix D*). The psychic trauma that the mind flayer endured when it died caused the crystal to form in its mind. A character can use a miner's pick to pry loose the psi crystal.

A character who attunes to this *psi crystal* gains a form of indefinite madness (see the  Indefinite Madness table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). Determine the result secretly, then convey this information only to the character's player. The madness does not end until the character is no longer attuned to the *psi crystal*. While the madness lasts, the character can hear a repeating telepathic distress signal put out by an illithid ship that crashed in the mountains and track the signal to its source (see "Id Ascendant"). The only way to block the signal is by ending the character's attunement to the *psi crystal*.

#### M13. Geode Workface

>>Sparkling geodes greet you as you enter this cavern. The gems are partially exposed in places, sticking out from the walls like glassy shards. The floor rises near the eastern wall, leaving a natural ridge with stone ramps leading upward on either end.
>>

***Treasure.*** A character using a miner's pick who spends an hour chipping away at the walls can remove an intact geode worth 10 gp. Up to fifty intact geodes can be acquired in this way.

### Returning to Termalaine

If the characters return to Speaker Masthew and tell him the mine is cleared of monsters, he thanks them profusely and explains that he must inspect the mine to verify its safety before they can be paid. He encourages the characters to spend a few days in Termalaine while he conducts the investigation.

If there are no more kobolds in the mine and the grell has likewise been dealt with, Oarus returns to the characters the next day and pays them 50 gp for their services. If Trex is still in the mine and Janth's ghost wasn't laid to rest, Oarus returns to Termalaine possessed by the ghost. If the kobolds are gone but the grell remains, Oarus is killed by the grell and doesn't return, leaving the town without a speaker. If the grell is still in the mine when it reopens, a handful of local miners disappear over the next few days before the decision is made to close the mine for good.

If the characters bring the kobolds to Termalaine, Oarus is initially hesitant to let them stay in the town. After hearing about their willingness to work, he decides to give them a chance and offers them menial jobs. The kobolds, eager to prove themselves, turn out to be good workers. The townsfolk tease them at first, but eventually the kobolds win them over. Janth's ghost, if it hasn't been laid to rest, finds someone else to possess, causing Trex to revert to his skittish, much less intelligent self.

# Chapter 2: Icewind Dale

Katabatic winds sweep down from the Reghed Glacier, ceaselessly battering anything that dares to grow or breathe in Icewind Dale. Without fail, these winds find their way through every chink and crack, every opening in the warmest furs, every tent flap, every roof and board of the strongest homes, draining away any hint of warmth.

The sun, held down below the horizon by the Frostmaiden's magic, offers no respite from winter's fury. The days are twilit, the nights dark. As Auril casts her nightly spell, a curtain of light weaves across the starry sky to keep the dawn at bayÃ¢ÂÂan aurora that portends an everlasting winter. Storms bring driving hail and sleet that leaves everything coated in a sheath of ice. Snow piles in deep drifts and blocks all trails leading south to warmer lands. The ice cliffs of the Reghed Glacier rise in the east like prison walls, while the snow-capped peaks of the Spine of the World loom to the south. North and west, the Sea of Moving Ice churns icebergs and floes in a deadly tumult, like winter grinding its teeth in anticipation of its next freezing assault.

Trapped in winter's cold embrace, nomadic humans follow herds of **reindeer** through their migrations, while others dare the treacherous waters of the Sea of Moving Ice in search of fish, seals, walruses, and whales to sustain them. Dwarves dig into the earth to seek shelter and mine for iron. Meanwhile, folk descended from foolhardy and treasure-mad immigrants eke out meager lives in Ten-Towns, which can barely hold back the wind, let alone marauding orcs, giants, and fierce tundra yeti.

Despite the unnatural cold and other dangers, people still brave the journey to reach this harsh winterscape, searching for opportunity and adventure.

![The goblin fortress of Karkolohk perches atop a rocky spur in the foothills of the Spine of the World](img/adventure/IDRotF/089-02-000.chapter-splash.webp)

## Running This Chapter

This chapter takes the adventure beyond Ten-Towns into the far reaches of Icewind Dale, to places the adventurers might visit as they investigate tall tales or undertake quests. These adventure locations are scattered across Icewind Dale, as shown on *map 2.1*. Also marked on this map are the remote locations featured in *chapters 3*, *6*, and *7*.

### Character Advancement

Although this chapter is designed for characters of 4th level or higher, some of its random encounters and locations are more dangerous than others. The characters might need to run away and regroup, or take short or long rests between encounters, if they're going to survive.

In this chapter, you decide how quickly the characters advance in level. Treat the following as recommendations:

- The characters gain a level after spending two or three game sessions exploring Icewind Dale.
- The characters gain a level for neutralizing the threats in two or three of the dangerous locations described in this chapter.
- The characters gain a level if they accomplish an extraordinary feat, such as ending the feud between the goliath clans of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag, or surviving a close encounter with Arveiaturace the White Wyrm.

Once the characters reach 7th level, they should no long gain levels by exploring locations or surviving random encounters in this chapter. Instead, direct them to the locations described in chapters 5 through 7.

### Tall Tales in Ten-Towns

By the time the characters reach 3rd level, they have garnered enough of a reputation that NPCs in Ten-Towns will share tall tales with them. When the player characters are ready to explore more of Icewind Dale, use the Tall Tales in Ten-Towns table to entice them.

You can either choose which tales to share with the players, or you can ask each player to roll once on the table. Let the players decide which tales (if any) they want to investigate.

##### Tall Tales in Ten-Towns

|  1Ã¢ÂÂ2  | "They say the Frostmaiden lives on a misty isle hidden among the bergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. There's a mighty strange whale with a boat on its back that swims in those frigid waters. I bet it knows where the island is! You can catch the whale at Angajuk's Bell, an old anchorage, but you must ring the bell hanging by the pier to call it." (See "Angajuk's Bell")                                                                                                                                       |

(See "House of the Morninglord" and "Black Cabin")                                                                                                                    |
|  5Ã¢ÂÂ6  | "Nabira Moarskull, an Easthaven fisher, owned an enchanted fishhook that could catch magical fish. While she and her friends were out on the ice one day, a pair of filthy gnolls attacked them. They killed Nabira and stole her fishing pole and hook. Hunters from Easthaven tracked the gnolls to an icy rift in the ground but were too scared to go farther." (See "Cackling Chasm")                                                                                                                           |
|  7Ã¢ÂÂ8  | "Head northwest out of Bremen, an' you'll see a pirate ship frozen in the ice less than a quarter mile from shore. No one's sure where it came from, but it's not goin' anywhere so long as this dark winter lasts. I bet its hold is full o' treasure!" (See "Dark Duchess")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  9Ã¢ÂÂ10 | "Did you see the weird comet that fell out of the sky a week ago? It went down in the mountains south of Ten-Towns, not too far away. Since then, some folk have been receiving mental messages in a language they can't make out. I think the comet might have something to do with that, and I bet you could find it easily enough, even in this weather." (See "Id Ascendant")                                                                                                                                    |

I wouldn't go myself, but maybe it's somethin' you'd like to explore." (See "Lost Spire of Netheril")                                                                                                                                 |

### Icewind Dale Quests

Instead of enticing players with the tall tales in the previous section, you can use any or all of the following quests to entice characters into exploring the locations described in this chapter.

#### Whale Oil Acquisition

Angajuk's Bell quest (see "Angajuk's Bell")

Ten-Towners need whale oil to keep their stoves and lamps lit, and most of that oil comes from whale hunters on the Sea of Moving Ice, which has grown more tempestuous and difficult to navigate in recent months. Helka Jaggerath (half-elf **commoner**), a whale oil merchant in Bryn Shander, hires the characters to serve as her bodyguards as she travel to Angajuk's Bell and rings the bell to summon the whale. There, they must help her persuade the awakened **sperm whale** to ferry them to the whalers camped on the ice floes of the Sea of Moving Ice so that Helka can buy as many casks of whale oil as she can.

Each cask of whale oil weighs 50 pounds and costs 25 gp. Helka has 300 gp, which is enough to buy six casks of whale oil and to pay the characters 150 gp for their help getting the casks safely back to Bryn Shander. She expects the entire expedition to last a tenday, assuming Angajuk cooperates. Helka cautions the characters not to tell Angajuk what's in the casks, since the truth might upset the whale. Her plan is to tell Angajuk that the casks contain fish oil, not whale oil.

#### Provisions for Macreadus

Black Cabin quest (see "Black Cabin")

Copper Knobberknocker, a gnome acolyte of Lathander staying at the House of the Morninglord in Bryn Shander (see "House of the Morninglord"), is worried about his friend, Macreadus, who's trying to build a device that can end the Everlasting Rime and return summer to Icewind Dale. Copper asks the characters to bring provisions to Macreadus at the Black Cabin and make sure he's all right. Because the gnome has paid for the provisions, he can't offer a reward; however, Mishann, the priest who runs the House of the Morninglord, offers free healing to those who complete Copper's quest and return.

#### Gnoll Heads

Cackling Chasm quest (see "Cackling Chasm")

Trovus, the dragonborn speaker of Caer-Konig, considers gnolls to be a clear and present danger to his town. He knows that a group of these savage predators has taken refuge in the Cackling Chasm and offers the characters 10 gp for each gnoll head they bring back to him.

#### Zero Rum

Dark Duchess quest (see "Dark Duchess")

The tavernkeepers of Five-Tavern Center in Bremen are bemoaning their dwindling supplies of ale and spirits, but they've heard rumors of a pirate ship stuck in the ice off the coastÃ¢ÂÂand where there's a pirate ship, there might be rum! The tavernkeepers hire the characters to search the ship's hold and bring back any alcoholic beverages they find, offering to pay a fair price plus a 150 gp incentive. Although this quest cannot be completed, because the ship's crew left behind no rum or other alcoholic beverages for the characters to purloin, other treasures aboard the ship far surpass what the tavernkeepers of Bremen could offer as a reward, so the quest is not without merit.

#### Distress Signal

Id Ascendant quest (see "Id Ascendant")

The characters are approached by four psychically sensitive Ten-Towners (human **commoners**) who have been kept awake by a telepathic distress signal that it seems only they can hear. They were drawn together by this common experience. They don't understand the message (which is in Deep Speech) but know the direction it's coming from. They offer the characters 250 gp to investigate the source of the signal and silence it, if only so they can get a good night's sleep. These Ten-Towners are briefly described below:

- Vedda Starsprit, a stocky, paranoid, 30-year-old trapper with exotropia
- Nars Beldrun, a tall, heavyset, 33-year-old shipwright from Targos who complains about everything
- Telvaster Hangingbell, a 25-year-old man from a well-off merchant family in Neverwinter, looking to escape his responsibilities
- Kaska Lang, a 30-year-old author writing a mystery novel about a series of fictional murders in Ten-Towns

#### Yselm's Way

Jarlmoot quest (see "Jarlmoot")

Yselm Bloodfang, a human **frost druid** (see *appendix C*), is a former Reghed nomad of the Tiger Tribe who gave up the nomadic lifestyle and settled in Ten-Towns three years ago, before Auril's everlasting winter beset Icewind Dale. A secret Auril worshiper, Yselm is known throughout Ten-Towns as a skilled wilderness guide. She recently encountered an avatar of the FrostmaidenÃ¢ÂÂa female figure made of snowÃ¢ÂÂthat commanded her to find the characters and lead them to their doom. To that end, Yselm approaches the characters and claims to be looking for work. She tells them about Jarlmoot ("a circle of giant thrones on a haunted hilltop") and offers to lead them there for 25 gp. "On nights of the full moon," she adds, "the spirit of Reggaryarva, jarl of jarls, will open his treasure vault to anyone who defeats his champion."

Yselm knows the way to Jarlmoot but doesn't help the characters fight any threats they encounter on the way, nor will she enter the circle of thrones or assist in the battle against Reggaryarva's champion. If the characters overcome the challenges posed by Reggaryarva, Yselm betrays and attacks them. A **winter wolf** sent by the Frostmaiden joins the fray on Yselm's side. Both villains fight to the death.

#### Peace Out

Karkolohk quest (see "Karkolohk")

A goblin messenger from Karkolohk was recently captured in Bryn Shander and found to be carrying a declaration of peace from Chief Yarb-Gnock, addressed to Speaker Duvessa Shane. Yarb-Gnock would like Speaker Shane to send delegates to Karkolohk to conduct "treaty negotiations." Sherriff Markham Southwell doesn't believe a word of Yarb-Gnock's message and offers a reward of 300 gp for the goblin chieftain's head.

Upon arriving at Karkolohk, the characters discover that the declaration of peace is either a genuine attempt to end hostilities with Ten-Towns, or a desperate ploy by Yarb-Gnock to lure adventurers to Karkolohk to that they can help him escape. As the DM, you get to determine Yarb-Gnock's true intentions (see "Gnome Diplomacy" for more information).

#### Hunt for the Red Yeti

Lost Spire of Netheril quest (see "Lost Spire of Netheril")

Yeti are growing bold and striking closer to Ten-Towns than ever before, going so far as to venture onto frozen lakes to attack ice fishers. Local merchants who earn a living selling yeti hides and meat are offering up to 100 gp for every dead yeti brought back to Ten-Towns.

A hunter named Mylbor Tafferac (neutral evil human **gladiator** with Survival +7) has been scouring the tundra for the Red YetiÃ¢ÂÂa yeti so terrifying and cruel that its fur is stained red with the blood of its kills. One night at a tavern, Mylbor bets the characters 300 gp that he'll find and kill the Red Yeti before they can. If the characters take the bet, the contest sparks excitement in taverns across Ten-Towns, leading to all sorts of side-betting.

The characters' search for the Red Yeti leads to the accidental discovery of the Lost Spire of Netheril. Only after the characters explore the lost spire and return to Ten-Towns do they discover the Red Yeti is deadÃ¢ÂÂfound and killed by the incomparable Mylbor Tafferac.

#### Wolf Tribe Cannibals

Reghed Tribe Camp quest (see "Reghed Tribe Camp")

After several furriers and trappers disappear without a trace, a representative of the Wolf Tribe named Aluka (chaotic good **werewolf** in human form) comes to Ten-Towns with a warning: a Wolf Tribe camp under the command of an evil chieftain named Sangra Grisgir is resorting to cannibalism to survive. The furriers and trappers are merely the camp's latest victims, and more disappearances are likely to occur unless the cannibals are dealt with. Aluka gives directions to the camp, but she can't risk an all-out war within her tribe, hence her decision to let Ten-Towns and the characters deal with the problem.

The Wolf Tribe cannibals have eaten all their sled dogs and their elderly. Even the children have been forced to resort to cannibalism to survive. If the characters act quickly, they can save the life of a lightfoot halfling trapper (**commoner**) named Honeybee Littlebucket, who has managed to stay alive by convincing the Wolf tribesfolk that she can catch snowshoe hares for them to eat. So far, Honeybee's traps have caught nothing, and her time (and Chief Grisgir's patience) is quickly running out.

#### Behind Bars

Revel's End quest (see "Revel's End")

Duvessa Shane, the speaker of Bryn Shander, is worried about rumors that the Arcane Brotherhood has sent operatives to Ten-Towns. She suspects that Vaelish Gant, an Arcane Brotherhood wizard incarcerated at Revel's End, might have information to share. Duvessa asks the characters to question Gant and find out what he knows about Arcane Brotherhood activity in Ten-Towns, offering a reward of 250 gp if they obtain useful information. She also gives the party a signed letter notifying Gant that, in exchange for his cooperation, Duvessa will petition the Lords' Alliance for a reduction in Gant's sentence. If the characters get nothing out of the prisoner, Duvessa asks them to inform the prison warden that the Arcane Brotherhood might be plotting a jailbreak to free Gant. While there are no indications that a jailbreak is imminent, Duvessa avails herself of this opportunity to make Gant's life worse.

#### A Goliath Problem

Skytower Shelter quest (see "Skytower Shelter")

Kwan the Monolith Akannathi, a **goliath warrior** (see appendix C), left Skytower Shelter on a quest to find Oyaminartok but ended up in Ten-Towns, where she indulged her addiction to games of chance. She recently dishonored herself by resorting to thievery to cover her gambling debts. Now she wants to atone. She asks the characters to help her return to Skytower Shelter and convince Arn, chieftain of the Akannathi clan, to put aside grievances and unite the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag toward a common purpose: bringing an end to the Frostmaiden's everlasting winter. Kwan has a stolen *figurine of wondrous power (silver raven)* that she offers the characters as a reward for their help.

#### Dragon Bone Stew

Wyrmdoom Crag quest (see "Wyrmdoom Crag")

Dannika Graysteel, a scholar whom the characters might know from an earlier quest (see "Starting Quest: Nature Spirits"), asks the characters to bring her some white dragon bones. Dannika has acquired a recipe for a magical stew that imparts the same benefit as a *potion of resistance (cold)*. She thinks she can make a good supply of the stew if she gets enough bones, which are the last ingredients she needs. Dannika has heard rumors that the bones of a white dragon can be found on a mountainside near Wyrmdoom Crag, and she suggests the characters travel there and beseech the goliaths of the crag to part with a few of the bones. Dannika will give her first batch of stew to the characters for free (the equivalent of one potion each) if they help her.

Although the recipe is genuine, Dannika doesn't realize that consuming dragon bone stew also causes madness, inflicting upon those who drink it the greed and paranoia of a dragon, which can be cured only by a *greater restoration* spell or similar magic.

## Wilderness Encounters

As the adventurers explore Icewind Dale, they might come upon friendly, indifferent, or hostile creatures in the wild. Such encounters can create suspense, reinforce the perilous nature of the setting, or create fun roleplaying opportunities.

You decide if and when random encounters occur. Use them judiciously. One or two per game session is usually enough.

If you're not sure how often to schedule random encounters in a 24-hour period, you can leave it to chance by rolling a d8 and consulting the Number of Wilderness Encounters table.

##### Number of Wilderness Encounters
|  d8 | Number of Encounters                                                            |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | One encounter in the morning (dawn to noon)                                     |
|  2  | One encounter in the afternoon (noon to dusk)                                   |
|  3  | One encounter in the evening (dusk to midnight)                                 |
|  4  | One encounter at night (midnight to dawn)                                       |
| 5Ã¢ÂÂ6 | Two encounters; roll a d4 on this table to determine when each encounter occurs |
| 7Ã¢ÂÂ8 | No random encounter                                                             |

### Running Wilderness Encounters

When you're ready to stage an encounter in the wilderness, roll two 20-sided dice of different colors. The first d20 is the **encounter die**; the second d20 is the **blizzard die**. Use them as follows:

- Roll the encounter die and consult the *Random Wilderness Encounters table* to determine what the characters come across.
- Roll the blizzard die and add 1. If this total is higher than the encounter die roll, the encounter takes place during a blizzard (see "Blizzards"). The blizzard starts 1d4 hours before the encounter is triggered and ends 1d4 hours after it is resolved.

The Random Wilderness Encounters table is structured so that certain monsters are more likely to be encountered in a blizzard than others. For example, at the two extremes, yetis are always encountered in a blizzard, whereas perytons almost never are.

Some the random encounters are designed to test the characters in battle, while others encourage roleplaying. All of them paint a picture of Icewind Dale as a harsh realm full of a wide variety of creatures struggling to survive. An encounter's difficultyÃ¢ÂÂnoted as Easy, Medium, Hard, or Deadly in the Difficulty column of the Random Wilderness Encounters tableÃ¢ÂÂassumes the characters are 4th, 5th, or 6th level. It's okay for some encounters to be easy and others to be hard or deadly. Easy encounters build players' confidence; hard and deadly encounters force players to weigh their characters' options and think outside the box. If the characters find themselves in a tough spot, give the players time to try to find a way out of it, encourage them to be creative, and award inspiration when appropriate.

### Encounters (A-C)

#### Arveiaturace

Known to Ten-Towners as the White Wyrm, Arveiaturace is an **ancient white dragon** that lairs atop the Reghed Glacier. She remains the most fearsome predator in Icewind Dale, although age has clouded her eyes with cataracts, limiting the range of her vision to 60 feet. Her blindsight, hearing, and sense of smell are undiminished, however. Fortunately for the residents of the dale, she prefers the taste of **reindeer**, walrus, and polar bear flesh to that of humanoids. The dragon has a healthy respect for humanoids and has never threatened Ten-Towns directly, though it wouldn't take much to provoke her into doing so.

At one time, Arveiaturace served a wizard named Meltharond, whose frozen corpse remains strapped to a saddle on the dragon's back. Arveiaturace has never acknowledged his death and still speaks to his body as if he were alive. He was, while he lived, her only friend and confidant.

![Arveiaturace the White Wyrm and Her Mysterious Rider](img/adventure/IDRotF/091-02-002.dragon.webp)

***Running the Encounter.*** If this encounter takes place during a blizzard, the dragon is buried under heavy snow, waiting out the storm with her outstretched wings lying flat at her sides. Her rider is visible above the surface, looking like a frozen, desiccated corpse sitting in the snow. If the characters are close enough to touch the corpse, they're already on the dragon's back. If they attack or otherwise disturb Meltharond's corpse, the dragon tries to shake them off. Each creature on the dragon's back when she rises out of the snow must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of her. The blizzard's wind keeps her from flying, so the characters' best hope of survival is to run away and lose themselves in the storm.

If this encounter doesn't occur during a blizzard, the characters see Arveiaturace in the sky or on the ground. If she's on the ground, she's eating a polar bear or a herd of **reindeer** that she has killed with her breath weapon. If this encounter occurs on the Sea of Moving Ice, the characters see the dragon erupt from the water nearby with a dead walrus in her mouth; then she flies back to the Reghed Glacier to devour her meal. As long as the characters keep their distance, the White Wyrm ignores them.

#### Awakened Beast

The frost druids of Icewind Dale use *awaken* spells to imbue native beasts with an Intelligence score of 10 and the ability to speak Common or Druidic. The druids use these awakened beasts as spies and messengers. Roll a d8 and consult the *Awakened Beast Encounter table* to determine what kind of awakened beast the characters encounter.

***Running the Encounter.*** An awakened beast looks the same as its normal counterpart, except for a hint or gleam of intelligence in its eyes. It can be neutral or evil, at your discretion. An awakened beast's task is to spy on the characters and ascertain where they might be headed, then report back to its masterÃ¢ÂÂthe frost druid who awakened it. This druid might be nearby or many miles away (your choice). For more information about frost druids, see *appendix C*.

The awakened beast that the characters encounter is smart enough to stay out of harm's way. If the beast is a dangerous predator such as a bear, tiger, or wolf, it keeps its distance from the adventuring party so as not to provoke the characters into attacking it. If it is harmed, the awakened beast retreats to a safe distance. If it's cornered and doesn't like its chances of survival, it bargains or pleads for its life. An awakened beast knows its territory well and can point characters to nearby locations of interest, food sources, or safe places to rest in exchange for its safety.

An awakened beast can be persuaded to help the characters, and perhaps even join the party for a time. Convincing a neutral awakened beast to travel with the party requires an offering of food or shelter accompanied by a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) group check. If the group check succeeds, the beast remains with the party for 24 hours, after which the characters can repeat the group check to extend the duration another 24 hours. An evil awakened beast accepts any offer to join the party (no check required), hoping to gather more information about the characters or lead them into a trap.

If asked to give its name, the awakened beast either comes up with a name on the fly or adopts a suggested name that it likes. If you're having trouble coming up with a voice for the awakened beast, try mimicking the speech of a cartoon character or a famous actor.

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Polar bear**                                                                                                  |
|  2  | Arctic **fox** (see *appendix C*)                                                                               |

|  4  | Snowy **owl**                                                                                                   |

|  7  | **Saber-toothed tiger**                                                                                         |
|  8  | **Wolf**                                                                                                        |

#### Battlehammer Dwarves

The shield dwarves of Clan Battlehammer have iron mines throughout the valley that extends from the base of Kelvin's Cairn. The characters cross paths with a group of 1d6 + 2 shield dwarf prospectors or fishers wearing cold weather clothing, goggles, and snowshoes. The dwarves also have backpacks to hold their bedrolls, mess kits, and rations. They carry fishing tackle or miner's picks, as appropriate. The dwarves are heading home with a sleigh loaded with rock samples (if they're prospectors) or a rack of knucklehead trout (if they're fishers).

***Running the Encounter.*** The dwarves are eager to get back to the valley and indifferent toward adventurers. A character can shift the dwarves' attitude to friendly by speaking to them in Dwarvish. Although the dwarves are grim, which is understandable given the inclement weather, they're neither violent nor spoiling for a fight.

If a stat block becomes necessary, the dwarves are lawful good **scouts**, with these changes:

- Dwarf Traits: They have a walking speed of 25 feet and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. They speak Common and Dwarvish. They have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.
- They wield handaxes and light crossbows instead of shortswords and longbows.

Here are some dwarf names, in case you need them: Bevris, Bolhild, Darrak, Dworic, Fallthra, Gardain, Harbek, Holst, Jarana, Kalanor, Morgrail, Nora, Nordak, Olunt, and Ulf.

#### Chardalyn Berserkers

The characters encounter 1d4 + 1 **chardalyn berserkers** (see *appendix C*), their flesh ravaged by frostbite. Obsession with chardalyn has made these humans psychotic. They go wherever Auril's cruel winds guide them, crave violence, and fight to the bitter end.

The berserkers retain vestiges of their former lives, including the thick clothing they wore as Reghed nomads, but their garments are torn and in need of repair.

***Frostmaiden's Ring.*** One berserker wears a magic ring made of ice on one finger. The characters notice this ring if they search the dead berserker for treasure. Inscribed on it is a tiny, six-pointed snowflakeÃ¢ÂÂthe Frostmaiden's symbol. If the ring is taken from the dead berserker, the ring disappears and all creatures within 100 feet of it are engulfed in swirling snow and teleported to the icy path that leads to the Cave of the Berserkers (see "Cave of the Berserkers"). There is no saving throw to resist this teleportation effect.

#### Chwinga

Chwingas are elemental spirits that mean no harm. They adapt quickly to almost any natural setting and occasionally offer supernatural gifts to those they glom onto. But a blizzard can drive a **chwinga** insane, causing it to behave unpredictably until the blizzard passes.

The characters encounter a **chwinga** (see *appendix C*) that makes its presence known by springing out of a snowdrift or appearing from behind a frozen bush. It looks like a spindly, snow-white doll wearing a decorative mask. In its tiny hands it holds a frozen berry, which it offers to the characters.

***Running the Encounter.*** If the **chwinga** is sane, the frozen berry is a harmless giftÃ¢ÂÂa friendly offering with a sweet taste. If the **chwinga** is insane, the frozen berry is bitter, and a character who eats it takes 1 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the next hour.

If this isn't the characters' first random encounter with a **chwinga** in Icewind Dale, you can substitute another gift for the frozen berry, such as a handful of snowflakes that won't melt for 24 hours or a beautifully carved icicle that melts like normal ice. If the **chwinga** is mad, it might blow the snowflakes into a character's eyes to cause temporary blindness or stab a character with the icicle for 1 piercing damage.

After imparting its gift, a sane **chwinga** behaves as described in *appendix C*. An insane **chwinga** disappears into the snow, then follows the characters and tries to steal little objects weighing 1 pound or less from them. (Stolen items are then hidden in the snow and probably lost.) Whenever it tries to steal something from a character, a **chwinga** must make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the check result exceeds the character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, the **chwinga** snatches the item and disappears without the theft being noticed. On a failed check, the character catches the **chwinga** in the act, foiling the theft, whereupon the **chwinga** tries to hide or flee. If it escapes, it keeps coming back to hurl tiny snowballs at the character who thwarted it.

#### Coldlight Walker

In the dark gloom of winter, this **coldlight walker** (see *appendix C*) stands out like a beacon. Characters can see its light long before they can discern its form. The walker doesn't care that its light betrays its presence. As soon as it detects the characters, it closes in for the kill.

***Running the Encounter.*** The coldlight walker is the undead remnant of a Reghed nomad or the shambling corpse of an unfortunate Ten-Towner who was cast naked into the tundra as a sacrifice to Auril and perished from exposure (see "Sacrifices to Auril").

If this encounter takes place during a blizzard, the characters experience the added terror of the Frostmaiden's whisper on the wind, telling them, "This is the doom that awaits you all. This is the fate of any who dare to claim what is mine. Behold the final light."

#### Crag Cats

Roll a d4 to determine how many **crag cats** (see *appendix C*) the characters encounter. During a blizzard, the crag cats rely on their hearing and sense of smell to track the characters while staying outside their prey's range of visibility.

***Running the Encounter.*** Make one Dexterity (Stealth) check for all the crag cats involved in the encounter and compare the result to the passive (Wisdom) Perception scores of the party. Any character whose score equals or exceeds the crag cats' check result is not surprised when the cats attack.

If one or two crag cats are encountered, they stalk the characters but keep their distance, hoping to pick off individuals who becomes separated from the rest of the party. These crag cats aren't brave or foolish enough to attack a group that outnumbers them.

If three or four crag cats are encountered, their numbers embolden them. They attack the adventuring party like a well-coordinated pack, focusing their attacks on the party member who looks the weakest and least armored. If two or more crag cats die, the others retreat.

### Encounters (F-H)

#### Frost Druid and Friends

A **frost druid** (see *appendix C*) approaches the characters in the form of a mountain goat or a snowy owl. The frost druid, who is human and can be of any gender, is joined by three creatures that are beneficiaries of the druid's *awaken* spell. These awakened beasts and plants serve as the druid's companions and spies, and they share the druid's evil disposition. Roll a d4 and consult the Frost Druid Friends table to determine each creature, or just roll once and assume all the creatures are the same kind of beast or plant. (It's okay if multiples of the same kind of creature are present, since the druid might favor a certain kind of beast or plant.)

***Running the Encounter.*** The frost druid aims to kill the characters or send them scurrying back to Ten-Towns. If the druid is killed or captured, its awakened companions behave as intelligent humans would when faced with the loss of their leader: either their morale breaks and they flee, or they become enraged and fight to the bitter end.

One of the frost druid's prepared spells is *moonbeam*, which can reveal the true form of any character who has the Doppelganger secret (see appendix B).

#### Frost Giant Riding a Mammoth

![Frost Giant Riding a Mammoth](img/adventure/IDRotF/092-02-003.mammoth.webp)

Even a raging blizzard can't conceal the presence of a **frost giant** riding a **mammoth**, as the earth rumbles and trembles with every one of the mammoth's heavy footfalls.

***Running the Encounter.*** The frost giant has come down from the Spine of the World mountains to hunt for wild game on the tundra or on the shores of the Sea of Moving Ice. If the characters hide in the snow and keep their distance, the giant and its mount continue unimpeded, and the encounter ends without bloodshed.

Characters who confront the giant and the mammoth are in for the fight of their lives, for the evil giant is happy to claim their heads as trophies as well as their treasures. In addition to its greataxe, the giant carries a large net that it uses to catch walruses and seals, as well as an enormous lance made from a sharpened mast that it uses to spear creatures while it is mounted. This lance deals 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage in the giant's hands.

A character who speaks Giant can use an action to try to change the frost giant's attitude from hostile to indifferent, either by offering it treasure worth at least 1,000 gp or by convincing it that the party is on a quest that would benefit frost giants in some way. For example, the frost giant considers Arveiaturace (see "Arveiaturace") a natural enemy and might spare adventurers who claim to be hunting the great white dragon. The giant might also allow characters to pass unmolested if they claim to be on a quest for the spirits of Jarlmoot (see "Jarlmoot"). Changing the giant's attitude in this way requires a successful DC 17 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check in addition to a sufficient bribe or a convincing story. If the check fails, subsequent checks made by the characters to change its attitude have disadvantage.

#### Gnolls

Ravenous and horrifying are the gnolls that prowl Icewind Dale. Only their small numbers keep them from ravaging Ten-Towns, gutting its residents, and wearing their torn-out ribcages as hats. The characters encounter a hungry pack of 1d4 + 3 **gnolls**. They cackle with glee as they move in for the kill.

These gnolls come from the Cackling Chasm (see "Cackling Chasm"), which provides them with shelter. Gnolls that are captured can lead the characters back to their lair, where they hope to gang up on the characters after luring them there.

***Running the Encounter.*** The gnolls are forced to range far and wide in search of food. Their hunger overrides their reason, such that they fight until being captured or killed. Any element of surprise the gnolls might gain by attacking the characters during a blizzard is lost because the creatures can't contain their excitement. Their anticipatory cackling betrays them.

#### Goliath Party

The characters come across four **goliath warriors** (see appendix C). They stride through the snow in single file, spaced about 10 feet apart.

***Running the Encounter.*** These goliaths are either members of the Akannathi clan from Skytower Shelter (see "Skytower Shelter") or members of the Thuunlakalaga clan from Wyrmdoom Crag (see "Wyrmdoom Crag"). The Skytower goliaths are indifferent toward the characters, but the Wyrmdoom goliaths are friendly.

The goliaths might be involved in a quest, a scavenger hunt, or an elaborate dare. They might also be looking for Oyaminartok (see the "Goliaths" entry in appendix C) or searching for a friend who got separated from them in a blizzard. They won't attack characters out of hand, but Wyrmdoom goliaths might challenge one or more characters to an athletic contest. If the characters accept this challenge, roll on the Athletic Contests table to determine what game the goliaths propose. The goliaths are mostly interested in bragging rights, but they're open to other possible rewards. For example, the characters might propose that the losing team carry the winning team's gear for a day.

##### Athletic Contests
|  d4 | Contest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Tug o' War. Two teams grip opposite ends of a 50-foot-long rope: the goliaths on one side, the adventuring party on the other. The teams need not have the same number of members, and the goliaths have no objection to being outnumbered. If the sum of the characters' combined Strength scores is higher than the sum of the goliaths' combined Strength scores, the characters win the tug o' war. If the sums are the same, the contest ends in a draw. Otherwise, the goliaths win. |
|  2  | Hand Standing. Each participant must do a handstand and hold that position for as long as possible. The contest ends when the majority of one team can't hold their handstands and either give up or fall over. Resolve the contest using DC 10 Strength (Athletics) group checks: each team repeats the group check until one team fails it.                                                                                                                                              |
|  3  | Shrub Pulling. Two frozen shrubs of roughly equal size are located nearby, and each team picks a champion. Whichever champion uproots their shrub first wins the contest for their team. The champions make one or more simultaneous DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks; the first one to succeed wins. If both succeed at the same time, the one who rolled the highest uproots their shrub first. If both succeed and their rolls are the same, the contest ends in a draw.               |
|  4  | Boulder Roll. Two 10-foot-diameter boulders are dug up, and a finish line is drawn in the snow 50 feet away from them. The first team to roll its boulder across the finish line wins. Resolve the contest with a series of simultaneous DC 15 Strength (Athletics) group checks. With each successful check, a team rolls its boulder 10 feet closer to the finish line.                                                                                                                  |

#### Goliath Werebear

The characters encounter a **goliath werebear** (see *appendix C*) in polar bear form, galumphing through the snow, belly-surfing down a snowy hill, or breaking through the ice on a frozen pond to catch a fish. If this encounter occurs during a blizzard, the characters might come upon the bear in a cave or other shelter. The werebear is either Oyaminartok herself (see the "Goliaths" entry in appendix C) or one of her kin.

***Running the Encounter.*** If the characters look like they need help, the werebear assumes hybrid form and greets them in a friendly manner. It has no clothing or manufactured weapons nearby, so it prefers its hybrid form over its true goliath form.

The werebear is happy to render assistance with no strings attached, serving as a wilderness guide until it feels like the characters can get by on their own. If the characters insist on repaying its kindness, the werebear urges them to seek out and destroy the **chardalyn berserkers** in their lair (see "Cave of the Berserkers"). The werebear understands how chardalyn can become corrupted by demonic magic and sees the berserkers as irredeemable victims of this corruption. Putting the berserkers out of their misery will help make Icewind Dale a safer place.

![{@creature Reindeer|IDRotF} Herd](img/adventure/IDRotF/093-02-004.reindeer-herd.webp)

#### Herd of Beasts

The characters come across a herd of beasts that is struggling to survive the endless winter. In clear weather, the characters can spot a herd from hundreds of feet away, even in the dark. If encountered in a blizzard, the beasts are hunkered down in the snow and harder to see. To determine what kind of herd is encountered, roll a d6 and consult either the Sea of Moving Ice Herds table or the Tundra Herds table, as appropriate.

***Running the Encounter.*** At the start of the encounter, the herd is indifferent toward the characters and poses no threat to them. If the characters threaten the herd, a single bull might attack them while the rest of the herd flees.

Ten-Towners and Reghed nomads oppose the mass slaughter of beast herds, since healthy herds are critical to the survival of other species. If the characters are of a mind to slaughter beasts indiscriminately, NPCs traveling with them might remind them of this fact.

Wherever large herds are encountered, characters can expect to find humans as well. Hunters in canoes pursue herds of killer whales, seals, and walruses on the Sea of Moving Ice, while trappers, furriers, and Reghed nomads follow herds on land. After the characters encounter a herd, you can stage a subsequent encounter with a group of these humans (see "Humans" in the next section).

##### Sea of Moving Ice Herds
|  d6 | Herd                                |
|:---:|-------------------------------------|
|  1  | 3d6 **killer whales**               |
| 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 | 6d6 **seals** (see *appendix C*)    |
| 5Ã¢ÂÂ6 | 4d6 **walruses** (see *appendix C*) |

##### Tundra Herds
|  d6 | Herd                                                                                                                                      |

| 3Ã¢ÂÂ4 | 3d6 **mammoths**                                                                                                                          |
| 5Ã¢ÂÂ6 | 5d6 **reindeer** (use the **elk** stat block); one out of every six has glow-in-the-dark antlers that emit dim light in a 10-foot radius. |

#### Humans

To withstand the extremely cold temperatures and vicious winds, humans of the Far North must wrap themselves in cold weather clothing, exposing as little of their flesh to the elements as possible. They must also contend with monstrous threats unique to this realm.

If this encounter takes place in the tundra, the characters come across a scouting party of 1d6 + 4 Reghed nomads (**tribal warriors** of the Bear, Elk, Tiger, or Wolf tribe) or a similarly sized group of trappers and furriers (**scouts**) out of Ten-Towns. If the characters are on the Sea of Moving Ice, they encounter a party of 1d6 + 4 hunters (**tribal warriors**) on an ice floe or in canoes, hunting seals, walruses, or whales.

If you need impromptu names for these NPCs, pull from the following list: Affra, Alif, Amina, Brynjar, Chen, Eremon, Hekili, Hishi, Iona, Kamakani, Koamalu, Ling, Margrath, Marrak, Nawra, Noboru, Omolara, Otilia, Quan, Saladin, Shatha, Sigurd, Stalvin, Udo, and Yngvild.

***Running the Encounter.*** Friendly trappers and furriers from Ten-Towns are happy to share the following tidbits:

- "Perytons swoop down from the mountains to hunt. If you catch sight of one, hide under the snow and hope it didn't see you."
- "If you eat the heart of an ice troll, you'll gain the troll's power for a day. But you must eat the whole heart."
- "Wanna know the safest way to explore the Sea of Moving Ice? Visit Angajuk's Bell on the coast and catch the ride of a lifetime!"
- "If you see a cloaked elf with charcoal-colored skin, purple eyes, and a pair of gleaming scimitars, for the love of Sune, don't attack 'im!"

Hunters, though territorial, tend to be indifferent toward strangers. They trade with folk from the mainland on occasion but prefer to be left alone otherwise.

If the characters encounter Reghed nomads, determine which tribe the nomads belong to and their initial attitude toward the characters by rolling on the Reghed Tribes table. You can make a hostile encounter with Reghed nomads tougher by adding more powerful tribe members to the group (see the "Reghed Nomads" section in *appendix C*).

Characters with the Outlander background have advantage on ability checks to improve the attitudes of hunters or Reghed nomads. Before any such check can be made, however, a character must give the hunters or nomads something of use (provisions or pipeweed, for example) or honor them or their chieftain with a gift.

If the characters change the attitude of a group of Reghed nomads from indifferent to friendly, the nomads invite the party to their nearest campsite (see "Reghed Tribe Camp"), where the nomads provide food, drink, and shelter.

##### Reghed Tribes
|  d20  | Tribe | Starting Attitude |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
|  1Ã¢ÂÂ5  |  Bear |    Indifferent    |
|  6Ã¢ÂÂ13 |  Elk  |    Indifferent    |
| 14Ã¢ÂÂ17 | Tiger |      Hostile      |
| 18Ã¢ÂÂ20 |  Wolf |      Hostile      |

### Encounters (I-Z)

#### Ice Troll

A hostile **ice troll** (see *appendix C*) wanders the dark tundra in search of prey.

***Running the Encounter.*** The troll lacks guile and takes no precautions as it lumbers toward what it assumes will be an easy kill, undaunted by blizzard conditions and hungry enough to risk whatever fire the characters hurl in its direction.

#### Icewind Kobolds

This encounter is with 2d4 **Icewind kobolds** (see appendix C). They are either looking for a white dragon to worship or marching toward Ten-Towns, hoping to find food and shelter.

***Running the Encounter.*** If this encounter takes place during a blizzard, the kobolds are huddled around a small, sputtering campfire inside a hastily built igloo. Otherwise, the kobolds are trudging through the snow, bundled in shoddy cloaks made from stitched-together weasel pelts and using their javelins to help them negotiate the frozen ground ahead of them.

If they're lost, the kobolds might ask the characters for directions. If outnumbered and threatened, they offer payment in exchange for safe passage. Otherwise, they try to rob the characters of their provisions and treasure.

***Treasure.*** Each kobold carries a pouch containing 5 sp and 5 cp. The kobolds hope these coins will be enough to appease the dragon they seek to serve or to pay for food and shelter in Ten-Towns. At your discretion, one of the kobolds might also be holding a *potion of healing* or some other common magic item.

#### Orcs of the Many-Arrows Tribe

Of the orc tribes living in the mountains, the most powerful by far is the Many-Arrows tribe. At various times in recent history, the great chieftains of this tribe have grown powerful enough to unite the orcs under the Many-Arrows banner. Some of these leaders have led the orcs through times of great peace, while others have used their power to conquer and destroy in the name of Gruumsh, the orc god of slaughter.

This encounter is with an **orc war chief**, who leads a hunting party that includes an **orc eye of Gruumsh**, six **orcs**, and a **half-ogre**. Painted in dry blood on the eye of Gruumsh's shield is the symbol of the Many-Arrows tribe: a crude skull impaled by three arrows.

***Running the Encounter.*** These orcs have come down from the mountains in search of food to feed themselves and other members of their tribe. Given the scarcity of food sources, they regard wayward travelers as fair game. Those they kill or capture are hauled back to the mountains as meat to feed the tribe.

Despite their hunger and desperation, these orcs can be reasoned with. Their initial attitude toward the characters is hostile, but any character can try to come to terms with them by offering the orcs something they can't get by simply killing the characters and taking their stuff. This includes, but isn't limited to, a song written to honor the chieftain of the Many-Arrows tribe, a drawing of Gruumsh (the orc god of slaughter) killing Corellon (the head of the elven pantheon), or directions to an alternative food source. Characters who speak Orc while conducting the negotiation have advantage on ability checks made to improve the orcs' attitude toward the party, as does a character with the Orc Stone secret who uses the stone to summon an orc spirit. Characters who speak Elvish or Dwarvish during the negotiation have disadvantage on such checks. If a worthy offering is made as part of the negotiation, the DC of ability checks made to improve the orcs' attitude is 15; otherwise, the DC is 20.

#### Perytons

Two **perytons**Ã¢ÂÂa mated pairÃ¢ÂÂhave come down from the Spine of the World mountains to hunt. They're looking to rip out the heart of a humanoid and take it back to their nest, where the female peryton must consume the heart to reproduce.

***Running the Encounter.*** The perytons' keen eyesight enables them to spot prey from great heights, while the dark sky makes them harder to see. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or lower are surprised when the perytons attack.

As an action, a peryton can rip out the heart of a dead humanoid within 5 feet of it. Once they obtain such a prize, the perytons disengage from battle and return to their nest. The perytons won't break off their attack until they get a heart.

![Snowy Owlbear](img/adventure/IDRotF/094-02-005.snowy-owlbear.webp)

#### Snowy Owlbear

A **snowy owlbear** combines the features of a snowy owl and a polar bear (see *appendix C*). This specimen is a ferocious, full-grown adult. Blizzards and cold weather don't concern it. Only a character who has the Owlbear Whisperer secret (see appendix B) can befriend it.

***Running the Encounter.*** The **snowy owlbear** is hungry enough to kill and eat humanoids, though it prefers fish and the flesh of hares, foxes, walruses, seals, and pack animals such as mules and axe beaks. If the characters toss food at it, the owlbear eats that food before chasing after more elusive prey.

If a character coaxes the owlbear into becoming the party mascot, you can tax the characters in gold to keep their pet fed and happy. The cost of feeding the owlbear is 9 gp per day, which is based on it eating the equivalent of three pigs (the *Player's Handbook* values a pig at 3 gp).

#### Yeti

This encounter always occurs during a blizzard. Roll a d6 and consult the Yeti Encounter table to determine what the characters encounter, or choose an encounter that you like.

##### Yeti Encounter
|  d6 | Encounter                          | Difficulty |
|:---:|------------------------------------|:----------:|
| 1Ã¢ÂÂ3 | 1d4 **yeti**                       |   Medium   |
| 4Ã¢ÂÂ5 | 1 **abominable yeti**              |    Hard    |
|  6  | 1 **yeti tyke** (see *appendix C*) |    Easy    |

Yetis and abominable yetis like to hide under the snow with only their pale blue eyes visible. They have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide because of their Snow Camouflage ability, and their keen sense of smell lets them detect prey they can't see through the blowing snow.

If the characters encounter a yeti tyke, assume it either ran away from home or got separated from its parents and is lost in the blizzard. See *appendix C* for more information to help you roleplay this monster.

***Running the Encounter.*** To determine which party members are surprised, have each character make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the yetis' Dexterity (Stealth) check. Characters can use their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores instead of making the check. If multiple yetis are present, make one checkÃ¢ÂÂwith advantageÃ¢ÂÂfor all of them.

After gorging themselves on the humanoids they kill, adult yetis and abominable yetis like to bite off the victims' heads and keep them as trophies.

## Places of Interest

The remainder of this chapter describes places of interest throughout Icewind Dale. Map 2.1 notes their locations, although you can move them elsewhere to suit the needs of your campaign. Although characters can stumble upon a location accidentally while traveling overland, they are more likely to be guided to a location by a tall tale (see the Tall Tales in Ten-Towns table) or a quest.

The adventure locations that follow are balanced for characters of at least 4th level. Lower-level characters can survive the encounters in these locations if they're cautious and manage their resources well, although they should be prepared to flee or hide when they find themselves out of their depth. Characters of 6th level or higher will face few real challenges, but you can soften them up and deplete their resources by staging random encounters as they travel to and from a given location.

![Map 2.1: Icewind Dale](img/adventure/IDRotF/095-map-2.1-icewind-dale.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/096-map-2.1-icewind-dale-player.webp)
## Angajuk's Bell

Swimming in the frigid waters is the legendary Angajuk, an old awakened sperm whale with a boat on its back. Most sperm whales live to be seventy years old, but Angajuk has been plying the waters of the Sea of Moving Ice for two hundred years. Throughout its life, the whale has faced its share of trouble, including near-fatal encounters with Auril's roc, which left scars along the whale's pectoral fins and body.

Angajuk is famous among Ten-Towners. Most people leave it alone, knowing that the whale is the beneficiary of powerful magic, but uncaring hunters see the whale as a source of ambergris, which is a valuable commodity.

Angajuk was once the companion of a druid named Anga, who cast an *awaken* spell on Angajuk to give the whale sentience and intelligence. Not much is known about Anga, but those who befriend Angajuk can learn about its beloved companion.

Characters might learn about Angajuk by overhearing a rumor in Ten-Towns (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns") or by agreeing to help a whale oil merchant (see "Whale Oil Acquisition"). Angajuk is one of the safest ways to get to Auril's island, because the sperm whale can travel beneath the water's surface, avoiding Auril's spies. When the whale is submerged, a magic bubble surrounds the boat to protect those riding in it.

Angajuk periodically visits an anchorage off the coastline, a rocky arch formed by the action of tidal waters, and can be summoned there by ringing a bell attached to the pier. Thick ice covers this rock formation, extending all the way to the shore. On the shore nearby is Anga's old stone cabin, which has weathered time's passage.

![Map 2.2: Angajuk's Bell](img/adventure/IDRotF/097-map-2.2-angajuks-bell.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/098-map-2.2-angajuks-bell-player.webp)
### Angajuk's Bell Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.

#### A1. Frozen Pier

A rowboat is stuck in the ice, trapped against a 10-foot-long wooden pier. The pier is ice-glazed and slippery. The characters don't need the boat, since they can simply walk across the ice to reach Angajuk's Bell (area A3).

#### A2. Stone Cabin

A small, domed cabin faces the bay. A bloated door covered in ice and dormant barnacles hangs slightly ajar on rusted hinges.

Anga once lived in this small stone cabin near the pier, which made it convenient for her to visit Angajuk. The place has been vacant for decades.

Thick rime coats every surface and object inside the cabin, including a bed draped in a thick knit blanket. Beside the bed, a small hearth holds a precious store of firewood. The firewood is infested with worms that have eaten away at the tender parts of the wood, but it's safe to burn. There is enough wood to fuel a nightly fire for three days, and it is stored in six bundles that weigh 30 pounds each.

#### A3. Bell

A 1-foot-diameter copper bell dangles from a 10-foot-tall wooden pole attached to this short wooden pier. The bell comes with a rope and clapper. Ringing the bell soon attracts three **giant vultures**, who think that the sound signals mealtime or the presence of prey. They attack unless the characters offer meat to satisfy them.

***Angajuk Arrives.*** It takes 30 minutes for Angajuk the **sperm whale** (see *appendix C*) to arrive after the bell is rung, accompanied by 1d4 harmless narwhals or dolphins. Angajuk has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common. Its deep, resonant voice carries a slight echo. Once the whale appears, characters must persuade it to be of service (see "Earning Angajuk's Trust" below). Otherwise, it submerges and departs after a few minutes. If the whale is befriended and the characters communicate their desired destination to it, Angajuk takes them where they want to go provided the location is on or in the Sea of Moving Ice. The awakened whale knows the location of the Frostmaiden's island and, despite some close encounters with Auril's roc, is willing to travel there.

Angajuk's boat can hold up to eight Medium creatures and their gear, and up to 1,000 pounds of cargo.

***Angajuk's Bubble.*** To ensure safe transport and to partake in undersea research, Anga designed a boat and strapped it to Angajuk's back. As the whale submerges, a bubble appears around the boat, enabling its passengers to breathe comfortably underwater. Creatures in the boat can exit the bubble whenever they want, but nothing can pass through the bubble from outside it. The bubble is magical but can't be dispelled.

#### A4. Hole in the Ice

When summoned, Angajuk surfaces through this hole in the ice, expels a gush of seawater from its blowhole, and settles itself at a height that enables people to climb up and into the boat attached to its back.

### Earning Angajuk's Trust

Earning passage on the whale's back requires more than just ringing the bell. Characters must earn Angajuk's trust and can do so in any of the following ways:

**Offering an Octopus**. Angajuk says it would be happy to provide transportation if the characters catch an octopus for it to eat. Octopi can be caught by fishing off the pier, but any hint of light deters them. Use the fishing rules ("Fishing for Knucklehead Trout"), only replace the knucklehead trout with an **octopus**.

***Befriending Its Comrades.*** Angajuk lives alongside other sea creatures, including narwhals and dolphins. The characters can lure one of these creatures to the surface with an offering of food (such as a fish) and befriend it with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, which pleases Angajuk.

- **Fending Off Hunters.** If the characters are having trouble finding another way to earn Angajuk's trust, use the "Whale Hunt" encounter below. Defending the whale against these hunters earns its trust.

### Whale Hunt

This is an optional encounter you can use to help the characters earn Angajuk's trust.

Hunters from distant Waterdeep have come to the Sea of Moving Ice to harvest ambergris, a precious substance formed in sperm whales' stomachs and typically harvested from a dead whale's remains. Although it smells foul when initially exposed to air, the scent grows sweet over time. As such, ambergris is popular among perfumers as well as mages who use the greasy substance in various arcane rituals. The raw form of ambergris is a waxy lump approximately 2 feet long.

#### The Whale Hunters

Five whale hunters (neutral evil human **thugs**) were staying at the Black-Bearded Brother, a tavern in Bremen, when they learned about Angajuk's Bell. The hunters arrive shortly after the characters but before the whale's arrival. They wear cold weather clothing and have brought four casks of oil with them. They intend to pour the oil through the hole in the ice, contaminating the water around Angajuk's Bell and poisoning the creatures in it.

The leader of the hunters, an older gray-haired man named Jendren Uruth, tries to recruit the characters, offering each of them an equal share of "the take." Jendren is not an honest man, but his fight is against Angajuk, not a well-armed party of adventurers. If the characters stand between him and his prey, however, Jendren tries to intimidate them into leaving Angajuk's Bell. Scaring him off requires a successful DC 17 Charisma (Intimidation) group check, since he's dead set on getting his ambergris. If the party's group check succeeds, Jendren and his fellow hunters withdraw, only to return 24 hours later.

If the characters fail to keep the hunters from executing their plan, the oil poisons and muddies the water for 4 days. After a day of contamination, several dead knucklehead trout float to the surface. However, much to the hunters' dismay, the sperm whale avoids the area even after the bell is rung. (For as long as the water is poisoned, Angajuk realizes this and cannot be summoned.) While waiting for the whale, the hunters camp out on the pier or in Anga's cabin. After three more days, they conclude that the poison didn't work and that the whale needs to be lured to the surface with bait. The desperate hunters try to capture a character to use for this purpose and, if successful, bind and lower the character into the water as a lure. Angajuk rises just long enough to fling the lure out of the water, sending the character sprawling across the ice, before submerging and leaving the area, denying the hunters their prize.

Jendren's death breaks the morale of the other hunters, who head back to Bremen in defeat.

## Black Cabin

Characters might be drawn to this location by a tale told in Ten-Towns (see the Tall Tales in Ten-Towns table) or by a desire to help a gnome in Bryn Shander (see "Provisions for Macreadus"), or they might happen upon the Black Cabin while crossing the open tundra.

### Secret of the Black Cabin

The Black Cabin was built by a ranger of the Far North long before the founding of Ten-Towns. When he moved on, the lodge became a refuge for others seeking sanctuary from the wind sweeping down from the Reghed Glacier.

Six months ago, Macreadus, a sage and devout follower of Lathander (god of the dawn and rebirth), formed a plan to end Auril's everlasting winter. He holed up in the Black Cabin, where he spent all his time assembling a weather-controlling magical device called the *Summer Star*, using knowledge he gleaned from a book about Netherese artifacts. Macreadus's device was similar in design to a *mythallar* (see *appendix D*), but much smaller. Unfortunately for him, it had a serious design flaw. When Macreadus tried to use it three days ago, it malfunctioned, incinerating both him and his book. Characters who search the cabin can find the sage's charred skeleton and his deadly creation.

Since the mishap, Macreadus's restless spirit has lingered in the Border Ethereal, unwilling to depart until its work is complete. (For more information on the Border Ethereal, see the "*Ethereal Plane*" section in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.)

#### Spirit of Macreadus

From the Border Ethereal, the restless spirit of Macreadus can observe happenings in and around the cabin, but it can't manifest physically on the Material Plane. Characters can see the restless spirit of Macreadus and interact with it only if they cross over to the Border Ethereal, which is what happens to someone who dies in the cabin (see "Dying in the Black Cabin" below).

In the Border Ethereal, the spirit of Macreadus manifests as a giant, floating, spectral head with fire burning in its eyes. Arrogant in life, Macreadus remains so in death. He's snappy and egotistical, blaming everything but himself for his failure. He welcomes the company of others, but anyone who questions his motives or mocks his invention quickly loses his favor. He spent months locked away in the cabin, building the *Summer Star* so he could end the Everlasting Rime, becoming more and more desperate to see it through. He had hoped to make a name for himself and win Lathander's praiseÃ¢ÂÂis that so wrong?

If the characters try to finish his work, Macreadus helps as much as his bodiless form allows. To lay his spirit to rest, the characters must fix his creation's design flaw and then activate it, all within the confines of the Black Cabin, where Macreadus can observe the results. Once he sees the device working as intended, his spirit departs to the afterlife.

#### Dying in the Black Cabin

If a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher dies inside the Black Cabin, its spirit (if it has one) leaves its body and assumes a spectral form on the Border Ethereal until the creature is brought back from the dead. This is what happened to Macreadus, and the same fate awaits characters who perish in the cabin.

If a character dies in the cabin and its spirit manifests in the Border Ethereal, the player can choose the form the spirit takes. It might look like a spectral image of the dead character, or it might be something bizarre like a ghostly crow or a blob of ectoplasmic energy.

Regardless of the form it takes, the spirit is not a creature and can't be harmed or turned. It can't make attack rolls and doesn't make saving throws, and conditions don't apply to it. It can't cast spells or attune to magic items. Creatures on the Material Plane can't see the spirit without some ability or magic that lets them gaze into the Border Ethereal. A spirit in the Border Ethereal can't speak to creatures on the Material Plane, or vice versa.

The spirit can do the following and nothing else:

- The spirit can move through the Border Ethereal. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, and it can hover. It can pass through solid surfaces that are visible on the Material Plane to explore closed-off parts of the cabin; it is bound to the cabin, however, and can't move more than 30 feet away from it.
- The spirit can make ability checks based on Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma only. It applies no modifiers to these checks.
- As an action, the spirit can attempt to exert up to 5 pounds of force on a creature or object no more than 5 feet away from it in the Material Plane, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma check. The spirit might use this ability to move a tiny object, write a message on a frosty or sooty surface, operate a simple tool, or tap someone on the shoulder, but the force isn't strong enough to cause harm to a creature.
- The spirit can see other spirits in the Border Ethereal (including the spirit of Macreadus) and speak to them. The spirit knows the languages it knew in life.

### Approaching the Cabin

>>Perched on the edge of a snowy ridge above a gorge is a black lodge on wooden stilts. Whatever path might have led to this ramshackle retreat lies buried under snow.
>>
>>Icy steps climb to a snow-covered walkway that clings to the south side of the structure. The building's slumped posture and sagging, snow-covered roof, coupled with the broken windows and loose, flapping shutters, suggest utter abandonment. Large snowdrifts huddle around the rotting stilts and engulf a nearby woodshed and outhouse. Only the wind visits this sinister place.
>>

The Black Cabin has two stone chimneys that rise several feet above its sagging roofline. The rest of the lodge is made of rotting wood. The stilts that elevate the structure are 20 feet tall, and characters who walk underneath the old building can tell that its wooden floors are in poor condition, perhaps even in danger of collapse in one location (see area B4).

It's clear to anyone surveying the Black Cabin that part of the ridge it rests on fell away some time ago, leaving the westernmost section of the building hanging over the gorge. All of the cabin's doors are closed and unlocked, and its windows are big enough for characters to climb through.

![Map 2.3: Black Cabin](img/adventure/IDRotF/100-map-2.3-black-cabin.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/101-map-2.3-black-cabin-player.webp)
### Black Cabin Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.3.

#### B1. Outhouse

This wooden outhouse is half-buried in snow. Characters who clear a path to the door and peer inside find a stack of discarded notes and blueprints, which Macreadus used as toilet paper.

#### B2. Wooden Walkway

Both entrances to the cabin are off this rickety, snow-covered walkway, the steps and boards of which crackle and creak underfoot.

There's a 4-foot-wide gap in the walkway that characters can easily leap across without making an ability check. But the walkway west of the gap (outside the door to area B4) collapses if more than 150 pounds of weight are placed on any 5-foot section of it. Any creature on the section of walkway when it collapses must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature drops 20 feet straight down into the snow, taking 1 bludgeoning damage from the cushioned fall and landing prone. On a failed save, the creature slides down the collapsing walkway to the west and plunges into the gorge, taking 49 (14d6) bludgeoning damage from the hard fall and landing prone.

#### B3. Workshop

>>Frost covers every surface of this abandoned workshop.
>>

The workshop contains a set of *smith's tools* and a set of *tinker's tools* spread across a wooden table along with some twisted bits of metal.

A bookcase against the north wall has a family of harmless squirrels living in it. (The squirrels come and go through a tiny hole in the floor near one of the cabin's stilts.) Apart from some scraps of paper and other detritus that the squirrels have collected, the bookshelf holds nothing of interest.

#### B4. Main Room

>>This room contains lingering smells of burnt wood and flesh. You also catch the faint odor of wine. Snow has fallen through holes in the roof, then been pushed into corners by stiff winds blowing through broken windows. The walls and furniture are scorched black, including a table with the charred remains of a book on it. Next to the table, on the floor amid several broken wine bottles, is a mostly incinerated skeleton and a round, frost-covered object about six inches in diameter.
>>

The important features of this room are the charred book, the partially incinerated skeleton on the floor, and the round object lying nearby (the *Summer Star*, described below). There's also a hidden hazard in this area: a weakened section of floor.

***Charred Book.*** Nothing remains of this tome except ashes and a badly burned spine, upon which characters can discern the letters ETHER. It's obvious that these letters were part of a much longer title, which happens to be: Magical Wonders of Netheril. Characters can find an intact copy of this book in the Lost Spire of Netheril (see "Lost Spire of Netheril").

***Skeleton and Treasure.*** Enough of the charred skeleton remains to suggest (without needing an ability check) that it belongs to a male human (Macreadus, though the characters won't know this right away). Little remains of his clothing, but a character who sifts through the charred bones and ashes finds an *amulet of health* that Macreadus used as a holy symbol. It shows no signs of damage, hinting at its magical nature. The amulet's pendant and chain are made of gold, and the pendant bears the symbol of two hands cupping the sun.

![Summer Star](img/adventure/IDRotF/102-02-007.summer-star.webp)

***Summer Star.*** This magic item looks like a 6-inch-diameter gyroscope featuring two scorched rings inlaid with runes and a dense chunk of coal at its core. The Summer Star has lost its luster but not its magic. A *detect magic* spell or similar magic reveals a weak, residual aura of transmutation magic surrounding it.

The first time a creature picks up the *Summer Star*, its core glows with a golden radiance as bright as a candle flame. Unless the creature drops the device immediately, the light suddenly blossoms, becoming a 10-foot-radius sphere of incinerating golden radiance centered on the device. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 90 (10d10 + 35) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this effect reduces a creature to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the creature is turned to ashes if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum. Once the explosion is triggered, the *Summer Star* becomes inoperable and safe to handle.

A character killed by the *Summer Star* becomes an ethereal spirit bound to the Black Cabin (see "Dying in the Black Cabin"). Don't fret if this happens to one or more characters; as spirits, they can figure out a way back to the realm of the living.

Once the *Summer Star* discharges its residual magic, the charactersÃ¢ÂÂboth the material and the ethereal onesÃ¢ÂÂcan safely analyze and fix the device so that it functions as Macreadus intended. The steps to be followed are summarized below:

***Step 1: Identify the Item.*** Any creature or spirit that studies the runes on the device's rings and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check ascertains that the device was designed to control the weather. An *identify* spell reveals the same, and Macreadus's spirit can freely divulge this information to other spirits. A character who has Macreadus's blueprints from the laboratory (area B6) can use them to gain advantage on the check.

***Step 2: Analyze the Problem.*** The device has a design flaw, obviously. Macreadus has concluded that the device's rings are unable to contain the magical energy that the core puts out. A third ring must be attached to the device, and this new ring must have runes like those that appear on the other two rings. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Insight) check comes to this conclusion. The check is made with advantage if the character witnessed the device malfunction.

***Step 3: Fix the Design Flaw.*** To craft a third ring, a quarter-pound of metal must be melted down in a fire and recast using smith's tools, then inscribed with runes by someone with a steady handÃ¢ÂÂthat is, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity (Arcana) check. Using tinker's tools provides advantage on the check. Finally, the device must be modified to accommodate the third ring, using either smith's tools or tinker's tools. The modification process can be completed in a few hours.

***Step 4: Activate the Item.*** A character must attune to the modified Summer Star to use it. While holding the device, the attuned character can use an action to cast the *control weather* spell from it, without the need for the character or the Summer Star to be outdoors. After the spell is cast, the Summer Star ceases to be magical. The spell lasts for the duration or until the character's concentration ends.

Macreadus knows what must be done to fix the device but can't activate the item because he's dead. If no one can attune to the modified *Summer Star* because everyone in the party is dead and trapped as a spirit in the Border Ethereal, nothing more can be done with the device until someone else comes along who can attune to it. Fortunately for the characters, they don't have long to wait before someone arrives (see the "Werebear Visitor" sidebar). Characters in spirit form can convince the new arrival to do what they cannot, perhaps by writing messages in the snow, or on a section of wall or floor using ash from a nearby fireplace.

Macreadus's spirit can finally rest after it witnesses the activation of the new and improved *Summer Star*. As it departs, the party receives a special blessing from Lathander. Any party member who died within the past 24 hours is instantly restored to life at full health, regardless of how the character died. In addition, each character who helped lay Macreadus's spirit to rest gains a *blessing of the Morninglord* (described below). For rules on blessings, see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

>***Blessing of the Morninglord.*** You gain 10 temporary hit points each day at dawn.

***Weak Floor.*** The section of floor shown on map 2.3 has weakened over time and gives way if 150 pounds or more of weight crosses it. Any creature standing on the floor when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls to the bottom of the gorge directly below this section of the cabin, taking 49 (14d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, the creature grabs hold of the edge of the remaining floor and is hanging from it. The creature can use an action to try to pull itself up, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, while another creature within reach can use the Help action to assist. A hanging creature can repeat the check until it succeeds, but if a check fails by 5 or more, the creature lets go and falls.

#### B5. Sweetberry Summer Wine

>>The scent of wine fills this room, which contains four frost-covered barrels.
>>

Macreadus was a heavy drinker, and the barrels contain his supply of Sweetberry Summer Wine. Any character proficient with brewer's supplies knows that this wine comes from a vineyard in the Dessarin Valley, hundreds of miles to the south. The extreme cold has caused the wine to freeze.

Despite its inability to partake of the libations, the spirit of Macreadus reacts poorly toward characters who thaw and drink this private stash.

#### B6. Laboratory

>>This room contains a fireplace and two empty bookcases. Tacked to the walls and strewn across the floor are frost-covered blueprints. Facedown on the floor next to one of the blueprints is a tiny man made of clay.
>>

Any character who examines the clay figure and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check ascertains that it is a dead homunculus. This was Macreadus's magical assistant, Blare. It died when its master died.

Any character proficient in Arcana can study the blueprints and conclude that they show different experimental designs for a weather-controlling magic device. One of these designs resembles a gyroscope and closely resembles the object found in area B4.

#### B7. Abandoned Bedroom

>>A stiff wind blows through the broken window in the east wall, causing the tattered gray curtains to billow and flap like angry ghosts. Snow covers a bed and much of the surrounding floor.
>>

This room is unfit for habitation and hasn't been used it in a long time.

#### B8. Macreadus's Bedroom

>>Wooden planks have been nailed over the broken window of this room to hold out the wind. Furnishings include a saggy double bed and a bookcase containing some folded clothes, a few blank sheets of parchment, and a set of calligrapher's supplies. Next to the bookcase is a soot-stained hearth, wherein a scroll lies amid the ashes.
>>

Macreadus had a rock gnome assistant named Copper, but the two had a falling out. One morning, after a bitter argument the night before, Copper decided to return to Ten-Towns. He snuck out while Macreadus was still asleep, leaving behind a letter that Macreadus angrily threw into the hearth after reading it.

***Copper's Letter.*** The scroll is stained with soot but remains intact, since Macreadus never got around to burning it. Characters who retrieve it can read Copper's message, which is written in Common:

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/103-02-008.handout.webp)

>>Macreadus,
>>
>>I've had enough of this damned, relentless cold. I feel it creep into my bones, my head, my heart. I'm heading back to Ten-Towns for a decent meal and a warm bed. I fear this endless winter has numbed your mind, and any tinkerer worth their chains can see the Summer Star is a fool's errand. Maybe without me here to incessantly complain to, you'll finally snap out of your obsession.
>>
>>If you truly insist on dedicating your remaining days to this doomed project, might I suggest that three is better than two. I considered telling you before, but you were particularly rude about the dinner I made last night.
>>
>>May the light of the Morninglord protect you,
>>
>>Copper
>>

When the characters find Copper's letter, give your players a copy of the handout (above).

Copper made it back to Ten-Towns, eventually finding his way to the House of the Morninglord in Bryn Shander (see "House of the Morninglord").

> ##### Werebear Visitor
>
>If the characters are stuck and need help dealing with the challenges of the Black Cabin, have a **goliath werebear** (see *appendix C*) arrive unexpectedly. This new arrival could be Oyaminartok herself, if she's still alive and roaming Icewind Dale.
>
>The werebear doesn't know the history of the Black Cabin or anything about the strange goings-on there. However, it likes to keep an eye on the place, if only to make sure evil creatures aren't hiding there. After helping the characters, the werebear offers to serve as a guide for up to seven days, though it avoids Ten-Towns.
>

### Frostmaiden's Revenge

The Frostmaiden is aware when someone uses the *Summer Star* to cast the *control weather* spell. She responds by sending a **coldlight walker** (see *appendix C*) and three **ice mephits** to kill the characters and anyone else at the Black Cabin. If the party is 6th level or higher, add another coldlight walker to the attacking force. If the characters have a goliath werebear on their side, add a third coldlight walker and two more ice mephits.

The attacking force approaches the Black Cabin from the east. As the characters emerge from the cabin, read:

>>Bright light shines from the eastÃ¢ÂÂa cold, hateful lightÃ¢ÂÂand seems to be getting closer.
>>

The coldlight walkers are made from the frozen corpses of Ten-Towners who were banished to the tundra as sacrifices to the Frostmaiden (see "Sacrifices to Auril"). The ice mephits descend from the darkened sky to provide aerial support, using their *fog cloud* spells to engulf enemy spellcasters or to obscure the approaching coldlight walkers. These monsters always do the Frostmaiden's bidding and fight until destroyed. If the characters flee the cabin, the coldlight walkers and ice mephits pursue.

## Cackling Chasm

A chasm in the foothills of the Spine of the World mountains gets its name from the cackling gnolls that take shelter inside it. Most who hear the maniacal cackles know well enough to stay away. The gnolls of the Cackling Chasm are emaciated and hungry, their laughing brought on by crazed starvation.

The characters might visit this location after hearing a tale about a murdered fisher and her magic fishing pole (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns") or after agreeing to undertake a quest for the town speaker of Caer-Konig (see "Gnoll Heads"). A gnoll captured in the wilderness can also lead the characters here (see "Wilderness Encounters").

### Tale of Gnoll Betrayal

![Chyzka the Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu](img/adventure/IDRotF/104-02-009.chyzka.webp)

After a **gnoll fang of Yeenoghu** murders its prey, any hyena that feasts on the kill is transformed into a full-grown **gnoll**. The gnolls of the Cackling Chasm, like all gnolls, were born in this fashion. But a rift has formed between the creator and its creations. The fang of Yeenoghu, Chyzka, is being blamed for the pack's recent misfortunes. It led the gnolls to Icewind Dale, promising abundant food. What the gnolls got instead was an unending winter and barely enough nourishment to sustain them. The gnolls are forced to resort to cannibalism to survive when food is scarce, and the pack has no hyenas to replenish its dwindling numbers. Because Chyzka lacks the ability to sustain the pack and create more gnolls, its usefulness has come to an end.

The other gnolls are too afraid of Chyzka to challenge it directly (it is, after all, one of Yeenoghu's chosen). The gnolls are, however, willing to stand idly by while the characters take care of Chyzka for them. Once the fang of Yeenoghu is dead, the gnolls will allow Chyzka's slayers to leave the chasm unmolested while they dine on Chyzka's remains. The characters' actions give them a window of time to take what they want and flee the chasm before the remaining gnolls turn against them.

### Approaching the Chasm

>>A yawning chasm ahead of you threatens to devour you as if it were a giant, icy maw. The wind sweeping through the mountains can't drown out the inhuman cackling that echoes in the chasm's depths.
>>

Characters who look over the edge of the icy chasm can see stony projections resembling teeth, as well as a ledge 30 feet down. (A wider ledge 100 feet down is probably initially beyond the range of the characters' light sources and darkvision.)

A search of the surrounding area reveals a cave mouth near the south end of the chasm (area Z1). Within the cave mouth are steps leading down to area Z2, which leads to the uppermost ledge of the chasm. Alternatively, characters can use magic or climbing gear to lower themselves down into the chasm.

![Map 2.4: Cackling Chasm](img/adventure/IDRotF/105-map-2.4-cackling-chasm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/106-map-2.4-cackling-chasm-player.webp)
### Cackling Chasm Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.4.

#### Z1. Cave Mouth

>>At the south end of the chasm, humanoid skulls are stacked on either side of a cave mouth that contains icy steps descending into the rock. Blood has been used to draw crude symbols on the skulls.
>>

The skulls belong to humans, dwarves, goblins, goliaths, and orcs. The symbol on each skull looks like a three-headed flail. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes it as the symbol of Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls. 

#### Z2. Feasting Cave

>>Crude steps lead down to a frigid, ten-foot-high cave filled with a putrid stench. The mostly broken bones of humanoids and animals lay scattered on the icy floor amid bits of metal and torn strips of leather.
>>

The gnolls gather here to eat when there's food to be had.

Most of the bones have been broken to enable the gnolls to get to the marrow inside them. Past feasts include elk, **reindeer**, moose, foxes, wolves, and humanoids. Some of the bones belong to gnolls who fell prey to cannibalism.

The four **gnolls** in area Z3 move here to investigate any loud noises. They don't attack intruders right away, however, except in self-defense (see "Tale of Gnoll Betrayal").

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the cave for treasure find a leather pouch beneath a pile of broken bones. The pouch belonged to a human furrier whom the gnolls murdered in the tundra and dragged back to the chasm to be eaten. The pouch contains 4 gp, 14 sp, 21 cp, and a random trinket. Roll on the Icewind Dale Trinkets table in *appendix A* to determine what trinket is found.

#### Z3. Shrine to Yeenoghu

>>A crude stone altar with a mountain goat's bloody head resting atop it dominates this eight-foot-high cave. The floor around the altar is littered with gnawed animal bones.
>>

Unless they were drawn to area Z2, four **gnolls** are crouched before the altar, weighing the ramifications of licking the flesh off the goat's skull, which is meant to be an offering to the demon lord Yeenoghu. These hungry gnolls don't attack intruders right away, except in self-defense (see "Tale of Gnoll Betrayal").

#### Z4. Frozen Rift

>>Thirty feet below the surface, a shelf of rock surrounds the chasm's gaping maw, its cracked sides riddled with caves and festooned with sharp rocks. Farther down in the chasm, you see dead gnolls impaled on some of these fang-like protrusions.
>>
>>Manic laughter echoes through the chasm as you look around, the sound ricocheting off the walls that make its origin impossible to pinpoint.
>>

Chyzka, the **fang of Yeenoghu**, encourages internal fighting whenever it senses the pack might turn against it. The dead gnolls seen throughout the chasm were victims of either these squabbles or their own carelessness. Although the ledge that allows access to the various caves is slick with ice, cautious characters can move on it without falling.

Every loud noise in the chasm can be heard in the surrounding caves, and vice versa. Characters who make enough noise to attract the attention of the gnolls can hear them coming by their manic laughter. The Cackling Chasm Roster provides a summary of these denizens and the areas they originate in. When Chyzka sees intruders, it barks orders to the other gnolls, after which there's an awkward pause as the subordinate gnolls give the characters expectant looks. Any character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check can ascertain that these gnolls have lost faith in their leader and would be delighted to see Chyzka fall.

##### Cackling Chasm Roster
| Area | Occupants                                           |
|:----:|-----------------------------------------------------|
|  Z3  | 4 **gnolls**                                        |
|  Z5  | 1 **gnoll fang of Yeenoghu** (Chyzka)               |
|  Z6  | 12 **gnolls** during the day, 6 **gnolls** at night |

#### Z5. Chyzka's Cave

>>Painted in blood on the walls of this eight-foot-high cave are pictographs of a towering monster with sharp teeth that wields what looks like a three-headed flail. Packs of hyenas feed on the corpses in its wake. A small fire crackles near the south wall, filling the cave with smoke. Cooking above the fire is a small green fish, while behind the fire, leaning against the south wall, is a blood-encrusted spear and a fishing pole.
>>

Chyzka, a **gnoll fang of Yeenoghu**, is resting here unless a disturbance has summoned it elsewhere. The bloody paintings on the wall show the demon lord Yeenoghu and his brood.

The cave is littered with pieces of dirty cloth and moldy hides, all taken from prey. The spear leaning against the south wall is nonmagical but has a silvered tip stained red with blood. Though the spear has its uses, Chyzka prefers to attack with its claws and teeth.

***Treasure.*** Next to the fire, a bloodstained bolt of cloth has been folded around a pile of coins the gnolls lifted from their victims, creating a makeshift bundle that holds 21 gp, 56 sp, and 117 cp.

The fishing pole is unremarkable, but a *hook of fisher's delight* (see *appendix D*) is tied to the end of it. Chyzka took the pole from an Easthaven fisher named Nabira Moarskull after slaying her.

#### Z6. Sleeping Cave

>>The strong scent of dirty fur fills this dark, ten-foot-high cave. The stone floor has deep ridges where hundreds of clawed feet have scratched it.
>>

If the gnolls in this cave have not been drawn out, add:

>>Gaunt, shivering gnolls huddle around a sputtering fire, cackling incessantly.
>>

At night, this cave holds twelve **gnolls**. That number drops to six during the day as half the gnolls leave the chasm to hunt for food. The gnolls huddle together for warmth. All of them are hungry and emaciated.

#### Z7. Storeroom

>>Rotten crates and torn sacks are strewn across the floor of this eight-foot-high, mostly empty chamber.
>>

The gnolls often take food supplies from slaughtered travelers headed to and from Ten-Towns. These supplies are brought here to be consumed. All that remains are the containers used to transport them. 

#### Z8. Caged Berserker

>>Situated atop the ledge is a cage made of thick timber beams with a bolted iron door and iron fittings. The cage is five feet on a side and seven feet tall. Inside it, a male human in hide armor paces back and forth. His murderous eyes lock onto any sort of movement he notices, and he clutches a javelin made of a black, crystalline substance. The skin on his hands and face is black from frostbite, and his lips are chapped and bleeding from the cold.
>>

The man in the cage is a nameless **chardalyn berserker** (see *appendix C*) with 60 hit points remaining. The gnolls captured him almost by accident. He ventured into the chasm a few days ago and brutally attacked any gnoll he encountered. One gnoll climbed atop the cage to get away from him. As the berserker started to climb after it, he was pushed from behind by another gnoll and locked in the cage. The gnolls are keeping him confined until he grows weak enough that they dare to open the cage to kill and eat him. The bolt on the door can't be reached by someone trapped in the cage.

During the skirmish, the berserker lost his chardalyn flail and two chardalyn javelins, all of which fell into the chasm. He still has one javelin left. The berserker tries to grapple any character he can reach through the bars; if he succeeds, he tries to stab the grappled character with his javelin on his next turn. If he is released, the berserker attacks the nearest creature without fear or remorse. Efforts to parlay with the berserker are met with hateful silence.

### Leaving the Chasm

Once the characters get what they came for, there's little reason to stay. In fact, characters who stay too long run the risk of encountering six **gnolls** returning from a hunt. There's a 20 percent chance that the gnolls have brought food with them, such as a dead mountain goat or crag cat, in which case the gnolls gather in area Z2 (along with any other gnolls left alive in the chasm) to feast on the fresh kill.

If the characters turn the gnolls' animus toward Chyzka to their advantage, they can come and go without having to kill every gnoll in the chasm. Even so, any gnolls they leave alive remain a potential threat to Ten-Towns.

#### Real Adventure Hook

If the characters retrieve the *hook of fisher's delight*, they might decide to keep it, or they might try returning it to Nabira Moarskull's family in Easthaven. Nabira left behind an adult son and daughter, both of whom have families of their own. One of Nabira's grandchildren, Ahmi, is celebrating a birthday soon, but Nabira's death has dampened the child's mood. Ahmi would be delighted to receive the fishing hook as a gift, if the characters are willing to part with it. Ahmi's family can scrape together 50 gp to buy it, if the characters insist on a monetary reward.

## Cave of the Berserkers

A group of human berserkers that has splintered off from the Tribe of the Bear uses this cliffside cave as a refuge. Exposure to chardalyn tainted by demonic magic has deprived them of their humanity.

Here are some ways in which the characters might learn about this place:

- A tale in Ten-Towns spurs the characters to visit the cave (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns").
- A ring taken off a dead berserker (see "Chardalyn Berserkers") teleports the characters to area Q1.
- A goliath werebear encountered in the wild (see "Goliath Werebear") or King **Gunvald Halraggson** of the Bear Tribe (see the "Reghed Nomads" section in *appendix C*) urges the characters to rid the cave of its evil inhabitants.

### Story of the Cave

This cavern complex was hollowed out by dwarf prospectors and miners looking for precious gems and metals. That effort bore no fruit, and the cave was abandoned. The Tribe of the Bear later used it as a shelter until the chardalyn berserkers forced them to abandon it.

The berserkers worship the Frostmaiden and no longer consider themselves members of the Bear tribe. They allow frostbite to ravage their faces and bodies to prove their devotion. As a reward for their fealty and their willingness to suffer the cold, the Frostmaiden gave these mad servants a stone brazier that emits a cold, blue flame. As long as the flame burns, the berserkers can't be killed inside their lair (see area Q5).

The berserkers share their cave with two white dragon wyrmlings, which hatched from eggs that the berserkers stole from within a glacial rift. The berserkers share their food with the wyrmlings, which guard the cave while the berserkers are out hunting.

![Map 2.5: Cave of the Berserkers](img/adventure/IDRotF/107-map-2.5-berserkers.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/108-map-2.5-berserkers-player.webp)
### Cave Locations

The cave's chambers and tunnels were hewn from solid rock by dwarves long ago. The berserkers carry torches to see where they're going. Characters without darkvision must rely on their own light sources as well.

The following locations are keyed to map 2.5.

#### Q1. Icy Path

An elevated causeway covered with snow winds toward the mouth of the berserkers' cave. Tracks in the snow clearly indicate that at least four humans have come and gone from the cave since the last blizzard. On either side of the causeway is a steep slope that plunges 20 feet into a snowy ravine.

***Waste Chute.*** Characters who examine the cliff face for other possible entrances can, with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, spot an opening in the cliff near the bottom of the ravine east of the winding causeway. This hole is one end of a chute that, once it enters the rock, ascends steeply to area Q4.

#### Q2. Bear's Head

>>Built around the mouth of the cave is a ramshackle wooden portico crudely shaped like a bear's head with its mouth agape. The tunnel beyond it is dark.
>>

The portico is sturdier than it looks. It has AC 15, 75 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Characters who damage the portico make enough noise to attract the two **white dragon wyrmlings** in area Q4. One makes its way through area Q3 to confront intruders head-on while the other descends the chute in area Q4 and attacks from behind.

The wyrmlings don't pursue prey that flees the cave. Instead, they roost atop snowy outcroppings above the entrance and keep watch for several hours before retiring to their lair (area Q4) to rest.

![The white wyrmlings Gelym and Tyzar perch outside the Bear's Head](img/adventure/IDRotF/109-02-010.dragons.webp)

#### Q3. Eggshells in Cells

Characters who pass through the bear's head portico step onto an icy ramp that ascends 5 feet to a 20-foot-high chamber festooned with icicles. A naturally formed pillar supports the chamber's domed roof.

Two alcoves set into the north wall are fitted with rusty iron gates. Their chains, padlocks, and keys lie discarded on the floor outside them. Inside each cell are fragments of the shell of a bluish-white egg that must've been as large as a halfling. Any character who examines these eggshells and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check concludes that they are white dragon eggs that hatched about three years ago.

Any loud noise here, which could be from the opening of either gate or the rattling of chains, alerts the two **white dragon wyrmlings** in area Q4. One confronts intruders head-on while the other descends the chute in area Q4 and swoops in from behind.

#### Q4. Waste Chute

>>This eight-foot-high cave is unfurnished and unlit. A hole in the southwest corner is the mouth of an open chute that reeks of blood and filth.
>>

If they have not been lured elsewhere, two **white dragon wyrmlings** named Gelym and Tyzar curl up together in the eastern part of the cave. They attack any creature that enters their den.

The stone chute is 25 feet long, roughly hewn, and steeply angled. It empties into the ravine outside and requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to ascend or descend without magic or climbing gear; a character who fails this check by 5 or more slips and tumbles into the ravine, landing in soft snow. Gore from the slaughterhouse (area Q6), not to mention human waste, is routinely dumped down the chute, which is stained with blood and filth.

***Treasure.*** The wyrmlings have begun collecting treasures and stashing them in a small pile against the east wall. Their paltry hoard consists of 96 sp, 331 cp, a stitched leather wallet containing a complete set of *thieves' tools*, a cracked spyglass (250 gp), and a *spell scroll* of *knock*.

#### Q5. Frostmaiden's Fire

>>Hundreds of icicles cling to the twelve-foot-high ceiling of this frost-rimed chamber, which is bathed in flickering blue light. The light's source is a blue flame crackling in a stone brazier that stands against the far wall. The white smoke that rises above it coalesces every few seconds into the form of a woman, but the image is fleeting.
>>

A *detect magic* spell reveals a powerful aura of abjuration magic around the 3-foot-high stone brazier, which rises naturally from the floor and is therefore not a discrete object. It can't be moved or damaged, and its magical flame can't be smothered or put out with water. Any creature that comes into direct contact with the fire for the first time on a turn takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.

Casting *dispel magic* on the fire snuffs it out for 1 hour, after which the fire reignites on its own. Using a *stone shape* spell to alter the brazier's shape puts out the fire for good.

As long as the brazier's cold fire burns, chardalyn berserkers inside the cave (areas Q3 through Q8, and the tunnels and chutes that attach to them) can't drop below 1 hit point. No other creatures gain this benefit. Characters who fight the berserkers inside their lair see them shake off damage that would normally kill them.

The berserkers are aware of the fire's benefit, as evidenced by the rictus grins that cross their faces when intruders realize the berserkers are seemingly unkillable. The berserkers don't automatically sense when the fire has been put out, however.

#### Q6. Slaughterhouse

>>The ice in this cave is stained pink and red with the blood of numerous kills. In the center of the room, beside a stone tray of butcher's tools, is the flayed husk of an owlbear's skeleton that has been skinned, gutted, and stripped of meat.
>>
>>Along one wall, metal hooks pierce the ice. A large man in blood-drenched hide armor hangs carcasses from these hooks to bleed out. His face and limbs are blackened by frostbite, and he seems to be absent a nose.
>>

A nameless **chardalyn berserker** (see *appendix C*) has just finished butchering a **snowy owlbear** that was lured into the cave and killed. The berserker grabs its weapons (which are always within easy reach) and attacks intruders on sight. If the flame in area Q5 is burning, the berserker can't drop below 1 hit point unless he's lured outside the cave.

#### Q7. Meat Storage

>>Shallow trenches carved into the stone floor are filled with snowpack. Clean haunches of meat are nestled in these trenches.
>>

***Treasure.*** Eighty pounds of fresh meat are stored here. The meat, which comes from various beasts such as polar bears and elk, is safe to cook and eat. The characters can sell the meat in Ten-Towns for 5 sp per pound.

#### Q8. Living Quarters

This 10-foot-high, frost-rimed chamber lies beyond a 10-foot-deep fissure. A frost-covered wooden plank spans the gap in the more trafficked tunnel that leads to this area. Four sleeping pallets covered in furs lie on the floor near the northwest wall. A wooden pail is used as a chamber pot, and it is currently empty.

### Returning Berserkers

After the characters have a chance to explore the cave and as they are preparing to leave it, three **chardalyn berserkers** (see *appendix C*) return to the cave with the carcass of a slain peryton. One berserker leads the way while the other two carry the dead peryton between them.

As the characters emerge from the cave, they see the berserkers on the causeway. More important, the berserkers see *them* unless the characters took precautions to leave the cave in a stealthy manner. The berserkers gain no benefit from the Frostmaiden's fire (see area Q5) while they're on the causeway, so they try to get inside the cave, attacking anyone in their way. If the fire has been put out, the berserkers won't know that until one of them is killed inside the cave.

## Dark Duchess

The ancient white dragon Arveiaturace (see "Arveiaturace") has placed some of her hoard in an abandoned ship called the *Dark Duchess*. This Luskan pirate vessel got stuck in the Sea of Moving Ice some months ago, near where the dragon likes to fish and hunt.

Having remained aboard the icebound hulk after being deserted by his crew, Captain Rudolph Bluemoon still watches over his riches even in death. A character who has the Pirate Cannibal secret (see appendix B) might want to return to this site to claim Captain Bluemoon's treasure. Characters might also be drawn to this site by a tall tale (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns") or a desire to help the tavernkeepers of Bremen (see "Zero Rum").

### Frozen Shipwreck

The *Dark Duchess* is hundreds of yards from shore, trapped in thick ice. When the characters get close enough to see it, read:

>>The Sea of Moving Ice stretches out before you, a featureless, frozen desert. Ahead, the smooth white surface is interrupted by a towering ship, its exterior covered in frost.
>>

The hull, rigging, and masts of the ship are covered in a layer of ice. From the waterline of the vessel, it's a 10-foot climb to get to the main deck. The sides of the hull are slippery and can't be climbed without using magic or climbing gear.

The ice around the *Dark Duchess* is thick, and there is no risk of the characters breaking through it.

#### Approaching the Ship

When the characters get within 15 feet of the ship, read:

>>You hear loud thumping and creaking coming from inside the hold, followed by the guttural snarls of some creature. The ship is not as abandoned as it appeared!
>>

An **ice troll** (see *appendix C*) was chasing a herd of seals when it spotted the abandoned ship and crept across the ice to explore it, hoping to find something tasty inside. It spooked some kobolds in the hold and chased them into a cabin. The kobolds were able to barricade the door, and the troll is trying to break through it to get at them.

Characters can surprise the troll if they remain quiet as they make their way into the ship's hold (*area D9*). Climbing onto the ship and moving through it without alerting the troll requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If a character fails this check, the troll hears the character's footsteps or the creaking of the deck and realizes there's an easier meal to be had.

![Map 2.6: Dark Duchess](img/adventure/IDRotF/110-map-2.6-dark-duchess.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/111-map-2.6-dark-duchess-player.webp)
### Dark Duchess Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.6.

Ceilings of the lower decks are 10 feet high, and all doors are 7 feet tall and made of sturdy wood.

#### D1. Main Deck

>>The wooden boards on the main deck are cracked from frost. A large hole in the deck exposes a part of the hold to the sky. The planks around the hole are marred with deep grooves, as if heavy claws had dug into them.
>>

To reach the hold, Arveiaturace had to break apart a large portion of the deck, creating a gaping hole. A character who examines the marks around the hole and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check can correctly surmise that a single enormous creature did all the damage. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can confirm that the marks were made by a dragon's claws.

***Entering the Captain's Cabin.*** The door to *area D8* is covered in a thick layer of ice, which the characters need to remove if they want to get inside. Using a miner's pick or similar tool, a character can chip away at the ice, breaking through it after 1 hour. (The more characters who help, the more quickly the ice is removed.) The noise is loud enough to attract the ice troll in *area D9*. If the characters melt away the ice using fire, doing so takes twice as much time but doesn't attract the troll.

#### D2. Forecastle

>>Deep grooves have been gouged into the deck on the forecastle. The railing on the port side of the vessel is broken and slightly bowed, as if an immense weight had been resting on top of it.
>>

When Arveiaturace climbs onto the *Dark Duchess*, she does so from the forecastle. Examination of the deck reveals that the dragon's weight has pushed down and cracked the wooden planks and gunwales in many places. 

#### D3. Aft Castle

Ice coats the captain's wheel. There's nothing else of interest here.

#### D4. Surgeon's Cabin

>>In this narrow cabin, shelves and containers are scattered on the floor amid piles of dirty bandages. Small clusters of dried leaves have frozen to the floor in places. A disheveled, frost-covered bed is tucked in an alcove under a wooden staircase.
>>

The surgeon's cabin has been searched by the kobolds living in the *Dark Duchess*, but they overlooked some items that might interest the characters. Under the bed are three vials of *antitoxin*, a *healer's kit*, and a *vial of holy water*.

#### D5. First Mate's Cabin

A frost-covered bed is shoved into one corner under a wooden staircase. The rest of the cabin is empty.

#### D6. Chart Room

>>As the door comes open, a light breeze emerges from this room. Pieces of parchment and paper flutter on the floor. A large, detailed map of the Sword Coast takes up most of one wall.
>>

This room contains two useful maps: the 6-foot-wide, 6-foot tall map of the Sword Coast hanging on the wall and a map of Icewind Dale stored in a map case that lies on the floor. A thorough search of the room also yields a set of *navigator's tools*.

#### D7. Storage

>>The foremost cabin holds two rime-covered barrels, lying next to which is a rat that obviously perished from the cold. Mooring ropes and fishing nets hang from hooks along the back wall.
>>

Nonperishable goods were stored in this cabin. The crew took a lot of supplies when they abandoned ship, but some equipment remains. The ropes and nets are salvageable, as are the contents of the barrels.

***Barrels.*** The characters must use a crowbar or similar tool to pry open a frozen barrel. The first barrel contains a *hooded lantern*, three *flasks of oil*, five bars of lime soap, and three sets of *manacles*. The second barrel holds ten *torches*.

#### D8. Captain's Cabin

>>The aft castle is taken up by one spacious cabin. Frost covers every surface and furnishing.
>>
>>A human corpse is slumped against the port-side wall, its left arm draped across part of a heavy chest that's tucked in an alcove under a staircase. The skeleton wears a jacket and a wide-brimmed hat that hides most of its skull. Under its right arm is a captain's journal. The floor is strewn with empty wine bottles.
>>

The kobolds have not set foot inside this cabin; in fact, no one has been here since the crew abandoned ship. The corpse is all that remains of Captain Rudolph Bluemoon, who stayed behind to watch over the ship and his ill-gotten booty. He ran out of provisions and starved before freezing to death. Affixed to the captain's hat is a badge that forms a curious symbol: a red eel wrapped around a gold trident. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognize this as one of the symbols of Ship Suljack, a powerful faction in Luskan that engages in piracy. Captain Bluemoon was a member of this faction.

In the captain's inside jacket pocket, the characters find a key with its head fashioned in the form of a rat's skull. This key unlocks the captain's chest (see "Treasure" below).

The wine bottles have labels that read "Sweetberry Summer Wine." The bottles' corks are not to be seen (though the characters can find them inside the captain's treasure chest).

***Captain's Journal.*** Bluemoon's journal chronicles the exploits of the Dark Duchess but says little about the man in charge. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check knows a story or two about Captain Bluemoon. This is a great opportunity to allow the player of that character to make up a credible story; if the player accepts the challenge, award inspiration to that player's character. The character also recalls that Captain Bluemoon was a cruel, cunning individual who ruled his ship through fear instead of respect. He had many enemies and few friends.

The captain's final journal entry reads:

>>"That damned white dragon is back, circling above me like a vulture. I reckon she could carry this ship back to Luskan were she of a mind to. To die from starvation, bitter cold, or a dragon? Choices, choices."
>>

***Treasure.*** The chest is frozen shut. Before the key can be used to unlock it, the characters must scrape off the ice and frost, which takes about 10 minutes. They can also use a torch or other source of heat to melt the frost in the same amount of time.

Inside the chest is a wooden partition that divides the interior into two halves. One side is empty except for a dozen wine-stained corks. (This is where the captain kept his bottles of wine.) The other side contains 150 gp, 520 sp, a small gold bracelet (25 gp), a large gold bracelet (250 gp), and a gray *bag of tricks*.

#### D9. Hold

Unless the characters lure it elsewhere, a frustrated **ice troll** (see *appendix C*) stands at the bottom of the wooden stairs leading down from the main deck. It is trying to claw through the door that leads to *area D12*. The troll can't be reasoned with. After disposing of it, the characters can survey the contents of the hold:

>>The ship's hold contains heaps of snow and four tied-down jolly boats covered with rime. In the forward starboard corner rests a large pile of treasure covered with ice. Standing next to the hoard, frozen with its maw open in a roar, is a white feline creature sheathed in ice.
>>

The creature frozen next to the treasure pile is a crag cat (see *appendix C*) that was killed by Arveiaturace's breath weapon and placed here as a trophy.

***Treasure.*** Arveiaturace's treasure pile is buried under four thick, translucent layers of ice produced by the dragon's cold breath. It doesn't represent Arveiaturace's entire hoard, merely the small portion she chose to bring aboard the Dark Duchess. Characters can see the treasure under the topmost layer of ice, and each layer of ice takes 1 hour to get through using a miner's pick or similar tool and twice as long using fire. Chipping or melting away each ice layer frees up the treasure under that layer:

- **First Layer.** Under the first layer of ice are 72 gp, 181 sp, 352 cp, and two pearls (100 gp each).

***Second Layer.*** Small art objects and gems lie under the second layer of ice. The characters find nine tattered pieces of indigo fabric lined with gold thread (25 gp each), three pieces of quartz (50 gp each), a single aquamarine cracked down the center (250 gp), and a scrimshaw figurine of an archer etched with magical script. This figurine functions like a *spell scroll* of *remove curse*, then turns to dust after its magic is spent.

***Third Layer.*** The third layer of ice covers 221 gp, a 1-foot-tall marble statuette of a griffon with gold inlay (250 gp), a black pearl (500 gp), a peridot carved in the shape of a leaf (300 gp), a *driftglobe*, and a *quiver of Ehlonna*.

***Fourth Layer.*** The fourth layer of ice shields the biggest, heaviest items and the treasure the dragon values the most: a 3-foot-diameter ceremonial bronze bowl inlaid with carnelians (1,000 gp), seven garnets (100 gp each), a suit of *mithral armor* (chain mail), and a near-perfect replica of the *Wand of Orcus* that emits green light from the skull at its tip. Any character who tries to attune to this *Wand of Orcus* realizes it's a fake, though it does emit magical light comparable to that created by a *continual flame* spell.

![The Dark Duchess is trapped in the iceÃ¢ÂÂanother victim of the Frostmaiden's everlasting winter](img/adventure/IDRotF/112-02-011.dark-duchess.webp)

#### D10. Galley

>>This cabin has been thoroughly ransacked. Dishes are strewn across the floor, and a galley table in the middle of the room has pots and ladles hanging above it. Tied to a low cupboard against the starboard wall is a thin goat. It lifts its head and bleats at you, shuffling toward you until its rope grows taut, stopping its advance.
>>

The crew took most of the food from this galley before abandoning ship, and the kobolds found and ate whatever scraps were left behind, sharing their meager findings with the **goat**, which the kobolds use as a pack animal. The ice troll hasn't yet detected the goat. The kobolds keep it here so the dragon doesn't eat it.

#### D11. Rum Storage

A key is jammed into the lock of this doorÃ¢ÂÂleft there in haste by the crew members who plundered the ship's rum supply before abandoning ship.

>>This cabin is empty except for a smashed wooden crate lying on the frost-covered floor.
>>

Someone who takes the time to study this detritus notices that some of the planks display parts of a painted symbol. The characters can reassemble the symbol by putting the planks together properly. The image is a circle, contained within which is the smiling face of a drow who wears an eye patch and a purple, wide-brimmed hat accented with a colorful feather plume. Elvish script around the circumference reads, "The Best Rum from Your Friends at One-Eyed Jax!"

#### D12. Water Storage

The door to this cabin has been weakened by the ice troll's claws and sits loosely in its frame. The kobolds have slid a heavy wooden bar across the inside of the door to keep it shut for now. The characters must break down the door to enter the cabin, since the kobolds have no intention of letting them in. The door has AC 15, 5 hit points remaining, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. As an action, a character can shoulder or kick open the door with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

>>The floor of this cabin is icy. Lying on their sides are two empty, open barrels. Hides and furs have been pushed into these barrels to create makeshift sleeping quarters. Two similar but upright barrels appear untouched.
>>

Four **Icewind kobolds** (see appendix C) hide behind the barrels and hurl their javelins at the first creature to enter the room. After they throw their javelins, the kobolds are weaponless. They worship Arveiaturace and do the dragon's bidding. They don't know when she'll return next, but she always does.

The upright barrels hold frozen, fresh water. The kobolds turned the empty barrels into sleeping hovels.

### Arveiaturace Arrives

Arveiaturace, an **ancient white dragon** whose vision is hampered by cataracts, carries the body of her former master, the wizard Meltharond, in a saddle on her back (see "Arveiaturace", for more information).

The dragon is out hunting when the characters first arrive at the *Dark Duchess*, but she checks on the ship regularly to make sure her hoard is undisturbed. At the end of each hour the characters spend in the *Dark Duchess*, there is a 20 percent chance that Arveiaturace returns to the ship. Because she can see only out to a range of 60 feet, the dragon must get close to the ship to examine it.

If the characters are below decks when the White Wyrm arrives, use the following boxed text to describe her arrival:

>>Over the howling wind, you hear the flapping of titanic wings followed by the cracking of ice under the weight of something immense. A loud snort accompanies the sound of claws scraping against ice-glazed timbers.
>>
>>The voice of what could only be a truly immense dragon fills the bowels of the ship. "I smell warm flesh and hear the panic of beating hearts. Ready your spells, Meltharond! We have uninvited guests."
>>

If one or more characters are topside, use the following boxed text instead:

>>A great white dragon descends from the sky, beating its wings furiously to slow its descent. A dark, humanoid figure is mounted on the dragon's back.
>>

If the characters hide and don't make a lot of noise, Arveiaturace climbs aboard the vessel from the forecastle and begins to make her way toward the hold. No matter where the characters are on the ship, they hear Arveiaturace board it, as her massive form makes the entire vessel shake and the ice around it crack. If Arveiaturace notices the characters, she immediately says to the rider on her back, "We know how to deal with thieves, don't we Meltharond?" She then attacks. If she doesn't notice the characters, she makes her way to her hoard, inspects the hold to make sure nothing is out of place, and leaves the ship to find and eat a tasty walrus. If she sees that the hoard has been disturbed, the dragon looks around the ship to see if the thieves left tracks and follows any she finds, calling out to Meltharond to ready his spells. If she suspects that intruders are still aboard the vessel but hiding in places she can't reach, she breaks through walls to get at them.

The characters are no match for the dragon. If they need a distraction to facilitate their escape, Meltharond's corpse could fall out of its saddle. This causes the dragon to break off her attack at once and check to make sure the dead wizard is undamaged. The dragon can't put Meltharond's corpse back in its saddle without help. If there any kobolds are nearby, they can assist; otherwise, Arveiaturace promises to spare the characters' lives if they lend a helping hand. Someone who makes a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the dragon's Charisma (Deception) check discerns that she has no intention of keeping her promise. If the characters simply bolt, Arveiaturace does not pursue them, afraid to leave Meltharond's side. Once the characters are beyond her field of vision, the somewhat dim dragon remembers that she's big enough to scoop up Meltharond with one claw; she does soÃ¢ÂÂgentlyÃ¢ÂÂand flies back to her lair atop the Reghed Glacier.

#### Tinjong the Verbeeg

If the characters are unable to stand against or escape from Arveiaturace, help arrives in the form of a **verbeeg longstrider** (see *appendix C*) named Tinjong, who lives in a seaside cave about a mile away.

>>A nine-foot-tall giant in thick walrus hide armor bounds across the ice with surprising speed and grace despite her gangly, misshapen limbs. Although her narrow face is hard to see under the fur-lined hood of her frost-covered cloak, it's clear that the left side of her face sags much lower than the right. As the giant draws near, she skids to a stop, rests her greatclub on one broad shoulder, and says, "Need any help?"
>>

Tinjong avoids the *Dark Duchess* because she knows the White Wyrm frequents it. If the characters accept her offer, Tinjong uses her *fog cloud* spell to obscure them, then tries to lead everyone beyond Arveiaturace's range of sight, which is 60 feet.

Tinjong worships Silvanus (god of nature) and has no agenda. She tries to be helpful while asking for nothing in return, and she carries nothing of value. Although she has no interest in becoming a permanent member of the party, Tinjong is willing to accompany the characters to Auril's island if their aim is to confront the Frostmaiden and end her everlasting winter, claiming that's what Silvanus would want her to do.

***Tinjong's Cave.*** If the characters need a place to rest and recuperate, Tinjong leads them to her cave overlooking the sea. It contains no furnishings, but there are plenty of furs for warmth and enough wood and oil to start a fire. A **chwinga** shares the cave with Tinjong but spends most of its time hiding in a rock. It emerges to greet Tinjong when she returns, however. The **chwinga** likes music and bestows a supernatural charm (see "New Chwinga Charms") upon the first character who spends at least 1 hour playing music for it.

## Id Ascendant

Stories about a comet crashing in the mountains (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns") or a quest concerning a telepathic message (see "Distress Signal") might bring adventurers to this location, as might a character who has the Escaped Prisoner secret (see *appendix B*).

![Otherworldy creatures issue forth from a crashed illithid nautiloid](img/adventure/IDRotF/113-02-012.nautiloid.webp)

### Nautiloid Down

Seven days ago, spacefaring mind flayers hoping to capture some interesting species for study crashed their shipÃ¢ÂÂa nautiloid called the *Id Ascendant*Ã¢ÂÂwhile trying to fly it through a blizzard. The ship's cocaptains, Vorryn Q'uuol and Dredavex Sinfiz, are chaotic neutral gnome ceremorphs, which are smaller-than-normal mind flayers spawned from gnome hosts. Their crew consists of three gnome squidlings named Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd. See the "Mind Flayers" entry in *appendix C* for more information about gnome ceremorphs and squidlings.

The illithids are stuck unless they can find a *psi crystal* (see *appendix D*) to jump-start the ship's propulsion system. Vorryn and Dredavex are expending considerable effort to keep their ship functional and thus cannot conduct the search themselves. They also can't trust the moronic squidlings to accomplish such a delicate task. For these reasons, the gnome ceremorphs need help. They have built a device that can detect the presence of *psi crystals* in a 5-mile radius but haven't found any. The characters might have harvested a *psi crystal* from the gem mine near Termalaine (see "A Beautiful Mine"), in which case the gnome ceremorphs would be very interested in acquiring it.

Complicating matters is the damage done by the crash to the nautiloid's life support system, for once this system shuts down, the illithids are at risk of freezing to death. If the shutdown occurs before they acquire a *psi crystal*, the gnome ceremorphs' back-up plan is to activate the nautiloid's self-destruct system (see area N7) before abandoning ship and making their way toward Ten-Towns with the gnome squidlings in tow.

#### Roleplaying the Gnome Ceremorphs

Vorryn and Dredavex want to leave Icewind Dale and return to the stars they call home with their squidling brood mates and a couple of interesting new creations or discoveries. They retain their gnomish curiosity and love of tinkering, now blended with the illithids' drive for control and experimentation. They are delighted to meet visitors who are willing to help them acquire a *psi crystal* or, failing that, help them and the gnome squidlings infiltrate Ten-Towns. In exchange, the **gnome ceremorphs** are willing to part with their laser pistols and the magic items in area N9.

If the characters want to search for a *psi crystal*, Dredavex gives them a handheld box that emits a clicking noise while a *psi crystal* is within 5 miles of it (see area N5). The ceremorphs tell the characters that *psi crystals* are most often found in places where mind flayers have lived.

Unlike most mind flayers, who prefer to communicate using telepathy, Vorryn and Dredavex prefer to speak aloud in Gnomish or Undercommon, with an accent best described as "gooey." Vorryn is persnickety and exasperated most of the time but also has a dry sense of humor. Dredavex is industrious and likes to ease tension by telling crude jokes it has learned from eating goblin brains. If they or any of the gnome squidlings are threatened, the ceremorphs react with deadly intent; otherwise, they shun combat.

#### Roleplaying the Gnome Squidlings

The **gnome squidlings** have a blind hunger for brains that often overrides their common sense. Beyond such base hunger, the gnome squidlings don't know what they want. They have the reasoning and emotional control of toddlers blended with the guile of bored housecats.

Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd make squelching and keening noises when excited or upset; otherwise, they communicate in bursts of emotion punctuated with short, simple words conveyed telepathically. The squidlings trust Vorryn and Dredavex and would be lost without the gnome ceremorphs to watch over them.

#### Telepathic Distress Signal

After the *Id Ascendant* crashed, the gnome ceremorphs activated a distress signal meant to be heard only by creatures that have telepathy, including any character who is attuned to the *psi crystal* found in the gem mine outside Termalaine (see "A Beautiful Mine"). The signal's technology hasn't been perfected yet, such that nontelepathic creatures have been known to pick up the signal as well. You get to decide whether a nontelepathic creature can sense the signal or not.

The psionic transmitter broadcasts on an endless loop until Vorryn or Dredavex decides to shut it off, or until the transmitter is disabled or destroyed (see area N7).

The signal has a range of 50 miles. Those lucky few who can detect it and set out for the source can feel it guiding them toward the downed nautiloid. The signal is a sequence of words in Deep Speech with a buzzing undertone. Any creature that understands Deep Speech and is sensitive to the signal can translate the message:

>>"Nautiloid down. Emergency protocols enabled. Crew safe, but vessel imperiled. Psi crystal needed. Come at once."
>>

#### The Crash Site

As the ship came down, it dug a furrow through the snowy valley before skidding to a stop. Its construction is partly organic, and the tentacles protruding from the ship's bow are coated in mucus that remains sticky even in the extreme cold.

The ship's interior is a mess. The walls are crusted with patches of flaky plaque, and the floor is splattered with sticky blots of an inky-black substance that courses through the ship's veins. Equipment is scattered everywhere, both from the impact of the crash and because of subsequent repair work.

#### Approaching the Nautiloid

>>As you trudge deeper into a mountain valley, an eerie glow betrays the monstrous outline of something stupendous and ominous. It looks like a cephalopod with slimy, ropey tentacles as thick as tree trunks that has tried and failed to bury its immense bulk in the snow.
>>

Two **carrion crawlers**, Vorryn's trained pets, scuttle through the snow near the ship. Characters who have passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of 11 or higher are not surprised when the creatures attack.

Characters paralyzed by the crawlers' tentacles are dragged toward the nautiloid. The crawlers' intent is not to eat the characters, but to deliver them to Vorryn for questioning.

#### Nautiloid Features

The nautiloid has the following features:

- **Biological Construction.** The ship is built of organic matter in addition to wood and iron. Walls, floors, and ceilings are reinforced with tough chitin.
- **Canted Deck.** The ship tilts to the south at a slight angleÃ¢ÂÂnot enough to hinder movement aboard the vessel, but enough to cause certain objects and liquids on the floor to roll toward the port side of the ship.
- **Ceilings.** Ceilings are 20 feet high unless otherwise noted.
- **Illumination.** All areas in the ship are dimly lit by fleshy, flickering, bioluminescent orbs mounted to the walls or hanging from the ceiling.
- **Interior Doors.** Each interior door aboard the ship is a fleshy sphincter that opens when a creature that has telepathy approaches within 5 feet of it, then quickly closes behind the creature and its companions to keep the heat in. A door must otherwise be pried or tickled open, which requires an action.
- **Life Support.** The failing life support system is keeping the ship's interior temperature at 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). The system gives out completely 24 hours after the characters arrive (unless they do something about it), at which point the temperature begins falling 10 degrees Fahrenheit per hour until it matches the temperature outside.

> ##### Nautiloids
>
>Designed to move through the Astral Plane, nautiloids are bizarre flying ships that can also transport mind flayers between the various worlds of the Material Plane. The *Id Ascendant* is one such ship.
>
>A nautiloid looks like an enormous nautilus shell fitted with one or more exterior decks and a large, forward-facing mass of rubbery tentacles. The mind flayers use these tentacles to scour the surface of a world for interesting creatures to take back home for study or a feast.
>
>The mind flayers have lost the secret of manufacturing nautiloids, meaning that the loss of any vessel brings them one step closer to remaining trapped on the Material Plane.

![Map 2.7: Id Ascendant](img/adventure/IDRotF/114-map-2.7-id-ascendant.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/115-map-2.7-id-ascendant-player.webp)
### Nautiloid Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.7.

#### N1. Forward Deck

>>This deck is five feet above the valley floor and covered with fresh snow. Mounted to the deck is a ballista covered in ice. At the back of the deck, a double door made of chitin and iron is tucked under two higher decks, the lower of which has another ballista mounted atop it.
>>

The double door is iced shut but not locked. A character can use an action to try to wrench open the doors, doing so with a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. The noise is loud enough to alert the creatures in area N2.

***Ballista.*** This weapon is inoperable since the crash.

#### N2. Cargo Hold

>>Attached to the walls in this chamber are three sets of chains and manacles designed to hold large creatures. A staircase rises to the next deck amid crates, barrels, and broken bits of equipment.
>>
>>Moving among the detritus are four creatures. Three of them are small, repulsive, purple things that float above the ground and pull themselves across the floor using oversized face-tentacles. The fourth is a lumbering monstrosity made of stitched-together parts from goblins, dwarves, and **reindeer**.
>>

The three **gnome squidlings** (Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd) are supposed to be cleaning up the cargo hold but are just pushing junk around and annoying Dredavex's **flesh golem**.

Unless one of the gnome ceremorphs is leading the party through the cargo hold, the flesh golem tries to beat the characters unconscious. The squidlings are compelled to try to devour the brains of unconscious characters, avoiding combat otherwise.

The heavy chains and manacles once held a pair of carrion crawlers and a bulette, all of which the gnome ceremorphs released after the crash. The characters met the carrion crawlers on the way to the ship; they meet the bulette shortly after they leave (see "Bulette Proof").

The stairway leads up to the battle deck (area N4). Characters who examine the cargo containers find two barrels of lubricant, two barrels of a pink slurry made from humanoid brains, a crate of machine parts, a crate of weapons (see "Treasure" below), and three crates that the gnome squidlings live in.

***Development.*** Sounds of combat here attract Dredavex, who arrives in 2 rounds. If any squidlings have died, Dredavex telepathically summons Vorryn and tries to kill the party. Otherwise, Dredavex calls off the golem and attempts to defuse the situation and clear up any "misunderstanding."

***Treasure.*** One of the crates contains six *laser rifles* in weapon racks (see "*Alien Technology*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information about laser rifles). Three of the rifles have been partially dismantled and are nonfunctional. The other three are intact, and each one contains an *energy cell* that allows the rifle to be fired 30 times. An energy cell cannot be recharged. Figuring out how to fire and reload a laser rifle requires two successful Intelligence checks (one to figure out how to fire it, another to figure out how to load it). Each time a character makes a check, compare the check result to the Figuring Out Alien Technology table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

#### N3. Cryogenic Stasis Pods

Each of these four rooms contains a 5-foot-diameter, crimson, semitranslucent crystal sphere in a low stand.

A door in the side of each sphere opens when a creature that has telepathy approaches within 5 feet of it; half the door swings upward and half swings down to form a ramp. Each sphere is a cryogenic stasis pod designed to keep a gnome ceremorph or a gnome squidling alive and healthy on a long voyage. The pods are nonfunctional unless the power core is fixed, which is beyond the ceremorphs' capability.

#### N4. Battle Deck

>>This middle deck has an open cowl. Mounted to the deck is a forward-facing ballista. The walls are lined with ballista bolts waiting to be used.
>>

Stairs lead down to area N2 and up to area N7, and a flesh door leads to area N5.

***Ballista.*** This marvel of gnomish over-engineering is still operational. Dials, knobs, and levers festoon the gunner's station, which comes with firing instructions written in Qualith (a braille-like script that illithids read with their tentacles). A character who hasn't read the instructions or had them translated must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to fire the weapon. If the check fails by 5 or more, the device misfires, dealing 9 (2d8) slashing damage to one randomly determined creature within 10 feet of the ballista.

#### N5. Maintenance

>>Crystals protrude from the chitinous ceiling of this oddly shaped room. Some of the crystals are lit, and others are flickering or burned out. Plates of chitin have been pried loose from the walls in places, exposing cavities filled with tangled masses of black tubes. Scattered across the floor are unusual-looking tools.
>>

If it hasn't been lured elsewhere, Dredavex is here, peering into a wall cavity and trying to figure out a way to keep the life support system from shutting down. The chaotic neutral **gnome ceremorph** (see *appendix C*) is equipped with two nonmagical items:

***Laser Pistol.*** Rules for *laser pistols* appear in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. This weapon can fire 33 shots before its energy cell is drained. After its last shot is expended, the weapon becomes inoperable. The energy cell can't be removed or recharged.

***Psi Crystal Detector.*** This black metal box is the size of a bar of soap. It emits an audible clicking noise when a *psi crystal* is within 5 miles of it. The closer the object gets to the psi crystal, the more rapid the clicks.

A character who tries to help Dredavex with the life support system can make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check after studying the alien technology for at least 1 hour. On a successful check, the character devises a solution that enables the life support system to remain operational for an additional 24 hours.

#### N6. Propulsion Room

>>This room contains a five-foot-diameter sphere of shiny black metal with small, transparent, hexagonal windows. Sharp metal tines resembling grasping claws protrude from the nearby walls and ceiling, stretching toward the sphere but stopping short of it. Along the walls are low-mounted control stations studded with knobs and dials.
>>

The black sphere contains the charred remains of a fist-sized crystal that could propel the nautiloid through the air and across space. The crystal cracked and imploded during the crash. Until a replacement is found, the ship is grounded. The gnome ceremorphs think they can use a *psi crystal* as a temporary fix, but they're not sure where to find one.

#### N7. Bridge

>>Suspended from the ceiling of this high-domed chamber is a complex lattice of bioluminescent jellyfish that use the glowing tips of their tendrils to form constellations. A high-backed chair with short armrests capped with sparkly blue crystal orbs tilts up toward the display.
>>
>>A panel on the starboard wall lies open, exposing a pulsing tendril of flesh embedded with crystal shards.
>>

If it hasn't been lured elsewhere, Vorryn the **gnome ceremorph** (see *appendix C*) is here, using the orbs on the ship's helm (the chair) to communicate telepathically with the nautiloid, which has the liquefied consciousnesses of several other mind flayers flowing through its veins. The chaotic neutral gnome ceremorph is equipped with two nonmagical items:

***Laser Pistol.*** Rules for laser pistols appear in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. This weapon is fully charged and can fire 50 shots before its energy cell is drained. After its last shot is expended, the weapon becomes inoperable. The energy cell can't be removed or recharged.

***Pacifier Rod.*** This 6-inch-long black metal rod has a button at the top. Using an action to press the button causes the rod to emit a chirp. Any creature within 30 feet of the rod that isn't deafened and has an Intelligence of 3 or lower must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. After each activation, there's a 25 percent chance that the rod breaks and becomes inoperable.

***Helm.*** This chair is securely attached to the deck and can't be used by creatures that are not mind flayers. Any non-illithid that sits in the chair and touches both blue orbs at once must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 10 minutes.

***Self-Destruct.*** If Vorryn touches one of the helm's blue orbs while Dredavex touches the other, they can jointly activate the nautiloid's self-destruct system. The gnome ceremorphs take this desperate action only if there's a good chance the ship's technology will fall into the wrong hands or if they're forced to abandon ship. Once the self-destruct's countdown timer has begun, it can't be stopped. A voice in Deep Speech counts down the seconds from 60. When the timer reaches 0, the ship disintegrates in an explosion bright enough to see from Ten-Towns. Any creature inside the ship or within 60 feet of it when this occurs takes 70 (20d6) force damage.

***Telepathic Distress Beacon.*** The "pulsing tendril of flesh" extruding from the open wall is the ship's telepathic distress beacon. It can be deactivated in the following ways:

- A mind flayer can use the helm to shut it off.
- Any creature can use an action to try to rip the tendril out of the wall, doing so with a successful DC 16 Strength check.
- The tendril can be destroyed or hacked off with a slashing weapon. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and resistance to psychic damage.

***Exits.*** Fleshy doorways lead to areas N8 and N9, while stairs lead down to area N4.

#### N8. Observation Deck

The deck is covered in frost. A pintle mount for a telescope is fastened near the exterior railing.

#### N9. Captains' Quarters

![A thoughtful adventurer transports a gnome squidling back to Ten-Towns](img/adventure/IDRotF/116-02-013.squidling.webp)

>>This domed chamber is full of clutter, a lot of it piled atop a table with one-foot-high legs. Behind the table is a five-foot-diameter crystal sphere mounted atop a low stand.
>>
>>Five strange, glowing gizmos are attached to the chitinous walls seven feet above the floor. These devices look like the tips of metal wands held in pincer-claws.
>>

The five gizmos on the walls fire beams of radiant energy whenever a non-illithid is in the room. At the start of each turn, each gizmo targets a random creature in the room (including mind flayers). The target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by the gizmo's beam, taking 4 (1d8) radiant damage. Each gizmo is a Tiny object with AC 16, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A character can use an action to try to tear a gizmo from the wall, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength check. Reducing a gizmo to 0 hit points or tearing it from the wall destroys it.

***Crystal Sphere.*** The crystal sphere is a cryogenic stasis pod, identical to the ones in area N3 and similarly nonfunctional.

***Worktable.*** Amid the clutter on the table are two magic items (see "Treasure" below), which a character can find only by rooting through the junk. Any creature that does so has a 50 percent chance of knocking two things together and triggering an electrical discharge. When such a discharge occurs, every creature within 5 feet of the table must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4 (1d8) lightning damage.

***Treasure.*** The two magic items on the worktable were fashioned on distant worlds.

The first is a sticky, metal monocle with a kaleidoscopic lens that functions like *eyes of minute seeing*.

The second is a slimy coif made from a living space slug, that functions like a *helm of telepathy*. A creature that attunes to this headgear can pick up the nautiloid's telepathic distress beacon.

### Bulette Proof

One last danger confronts the heroes as they leave the ship and head out of the mountain valley:

>>Something big is plowing through the deep snow, heading in your direction. Only its shiny dorsal ridge breaks the snow's surface.
>>

Vorryn and Dredavex released a hostile **bulette** into the wild after the crash because they didn't want to feed it. They have no control over the creature, and they have all but forgotten about it. They fail to warn the characters that it poses a threat to anyone approaching or leaving the ship.

The characters first notice the bulette when it's 120 feet away from them, and it has three-quarters cover under the snow. When it gets within 30 feet of the party, the bulette springs out of the snow and uses its Deadly Leap.

If the characters don't kill it, the bulette gradually migrates toward Ten-Towns.

## Jarlmoot

The characters might come here after hearing a tale about a circle of giant thrones (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns"), or they might be led here by Yselm Bloodfang (see "Yselm's Way").

Seven empty, ice-glazed thrones form a ring atop a snow-covered hillock. Under the light of a full moon, the apparitions of dead frost giant jarls appear in the thrones, clutching the ends of their armrests with icy fingers as they reminisce about the glorious past.

The ancient thrones are carved out of blocks of stone. When the apparitions of the frost giants manifest, their eyes glow white in the darkness. Three of the giants have on fur vests and leather trousers; three others wear chainmail from head to toe. The seventh giant, Reggaryarva, is slightly larger than the others and wears a coat of white dragon scales and a magnificent horned helm. Reggaryarva was once called the "jarl of jarls" and often had the final sayÃ¢ÂÂor axe blowÃ¢ÂÂin any heated discussion. He sits in the throne that faces north, as he should. Beneath Reggaryarva's throne is a vault dedicated to Thrym, the god of the frost giants.

![Map 2.8: Jarlmoot](img/adventure/IDRotF/117-map-2.8-jarlmoot.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/118-map-2.8-jarlmoot-player.webp)
### Jarlmoot Locations

The following area descriptions are keyed to map 2.8.

#### J1. Ring of Thrones

>>Ice covers seven giant thrones arrayed in a ring atop a snow-covered hill. Scores of black ravens gather overhead.
>>

A *detect magic* spell or similar magic reveals an aura of necromancy around the ring of thrones and extending 10 feet beyond the outer edge of the ring. While in this area, creatures that do not have resistance or immunity to cold damage gain vulnerability to cold damage.

The characters can see the frost giant apparitions only if they step into the ring under the light of a full moon. Otherwise, the thrones are empty, and the characters have nothing else to interact with. The apparitions refuse to speak in the characters' presence, and they can't be harmed or turned. Barely lifting one finger, the apparition of Reggaryarva summons a **frost giant skeleton** (see *appendix C*) to challenge the party. If the skeleton is defeated, it disappears, and Reggaryarva summons two **invisible stalkers** to carry on the fight. Each creature summoned in this manner appears in an unoccupied space of Reggaryarva's choice within the circle of thrones.

If the characters defeat the frost giant skeleton and the invisible stalkers, Reggaryarva is impressed and challenges them no more. Furthermore, the characters' triumph earns them a reward: access to the vault under the hill. The other six apparitions intone ancient words in Giant, causing Reggaryarva to fade away as his throne rises 30 feet into the air, revealing a hidden staircase that descends to area J2.

If she is present, Yselm Bloodfang betrays and attacks them as Reggaryarva's throne rises into the air. A **winter wolf** sent by the Frostmaiden joins the fray on Yselm's side. Both villains fight to the death.

When the full moon disappears below the horizon, Reggaryarva's throne slowly lowers back into place, sealing the vault entrance once more.

#### J2. Hall of Braziers

Jarlmoot's underground vault is hewn out of rock and has flat, 25-foot-high ceilings throughout. As the characters descend the stairs, read:

>>To your left as you enter this dark hall is a closed, stone double door with no handles or hinges on this side. To your right is a curved tunnel blocked by an iron gate that has one-foot-square gaps between its horizontal and vertical bars. The iron hinges on the northern side of the gate indicate that it swings inward.
>>
>>Situated in shallow alcoves at the far end of this hall are six braziers, each one in the shape of a four-foot-tall, two-foot-wide stone urn held snugly atop a five-foot-high, clawed basalt pedestal. Carved into each urn is a rune. Above the alcoves looms a stone archway, into which some words are inscribed.
>>

The inscription carved into the arch above the alcoves is a poem written in the Dwarvish alphabet:

>Snatch a scale from a sleeping wyrm;
>
>Against the blowing wind, stand firm.
>
>Climb a mountain with a stone in your shoe;
>
>On little feet, death comes for you.
>
>Be the arrow that starts the war;
>
>Let life's blood fall till it falls no more.
>

***Double Door.*** The double door to area J5 is unlocked. As an action, a character can push open either door with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

***Locked Gate.*** The iron gate that seals off area J3 won't open until all six braziers in the hall are lit. The gaps between the bars are too small for Small or Medium characters to squeeze through.

***Stone Braziers.*** Any character who understands Dwarvish or Giant can interpret the runes on the six braziers as follows: dod (death), fjell (mountain), krig (war), liv (life), vind (wind), and wyrm (dragon). When the proper ingredients are placed inside one, magical fire fills the brazier. This fire destroys the brazier's nonmagical contents and burns for 1 hour. Only while all six braziers are lit can the gate to area J3 be opened.

Characters can find most of the ingredients they need in area J5. The poem (see above) provides clues to help the characters figure out which of the ingredients belongs in each brazier. For example, the first line of the poem contains the words "scale" and "wyrm," suggesting that a dragon's scale is needed for the brazier that bears the wyrm rune.

- **Wyrm (Dragon).** Dropping a dragon's scale in this brazier summons forth its fire. The characters can substitute some other dragon body part, such as a fang or a claw.
- **Vind (Wind).** Blowing air into this brazier lights its fire. No ingredient is required.
- **Fjell (Mountain).** Dropping a stone or a pebble from a mountain into this brazier summons forth its fire.
- **Dod (Death).** Dropping a Tiny, dead creature, or three drops of blood from any dead creature, into this brazier summons forth its fire.
- **Krig (War).** Dropping an arrow into this brazier summons forth its fire. The characters can substitute some other piece of ammunition, such as a crossbow bolt or sling stone.
- **Liv (Life).** Three drops of blood from a living creature must fall into this brazier to make its fire appear.

### Giant Runes (Area J2)

![Dod (Death Rune)](img/adventure/IDRotF/119-02-015.runes.webp)![Fjell (Mountain Rune)](img/adventure/IDRotF/120-02-016.runes.webp)![Krig (War Rune)](img/adventure/IDRotF/121-02-017.runes.webp)![Liv (Life Rune)](img/adventure/IDRotF/122-02-018.runes.webp)![Vind (Wind Rune)](img/adventure/IDRotF/123-02-019.runes.webp)![Wyrm (Dragon Rune)](img/adventure/IDRotF/124-02-020.runes.webp)
#### J3. Curved Tunnel

There is nothing remarkable about this tunnel. It ends at a pair of heavy stone doors. A character can use an action to push open either door with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, allowing access to area J4.

#### J4. Turn the Gold Key?

>>A large oak chest with silver fittings stands against the wall directly opposite the double doors. A gold key sticks out of the chest's built-in lock.
>>

The chest is 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 6 feet tall, with a half-barrel-shaped lid. It is stuck to the floor and can't be moved. The gold key in the lock is not the key that unlocks the chest, and it can be safely removed. (The real key is in area J5.) After the key is pulled out, a character can use thieves' tools to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the chest.

***Exit Portal.*** Turning the gold key in the lock doesn't unlock the chest but instead conjures a 10-foot-square doorway through which area J1 can be seen. The doorway appears on the north wall, above the chest. Any creature that passes through this doorway is teleported to an unoccupied space within Jarlmoot's circle of thrones. A **swarm of ravens** then descends upon that creature and attacks it. Enough ravens are circling Jarlmoot to create four such swarms.

The portal is one-way only; it can't be seen or entered from area J1. The portal closes automatically after 10 minutes, causing the gold key to turn back to its original position. The portal closes instantly if the gold key is removed from the chest's lock.

***Treasure.*** The gold key is worth 25 gp. Inside the chest, held in a wooden brace, is a *horn of blasting*. Stacked around the horn are six flying battleaxes (use the **flying sword** stat block) that attack as soon as the lid opens.

#### J5. Chamber of Chests

>>This chamber holds four large wooden chests with iron fittings and built-in locks. Hanging from a hook in the middle of the ceiling is a one-foot-diameter iron ring with four one-foot-long iron keys and a single, one-foot-long silver key dangling from it.
>>

The keys are sized appropriately for the locks on the oversized chests. To reach the ring of keys, the characters must either use magic to climb the walls or stack the chests on end and climb them. Other solutions might present themselves; try to reward the players' ingenuity. The ring of keys is too heavy to lift with a *mage hand* spell, but the spell can be used to unscrew the hook from which the ring hangs, causing the keys to fall. The iron keys unlock the chests in this room. The silver key (which is worth 2 gp) unlocks the chest in area J4.

***Chests.*** Each chest weighs 150 pounds and is 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 6 feet tall, with a half-barrel-shaped lid. A character can use an action to try to pick a chest's lock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens a chest.

Each chest contains a single item. The four items are as follows:

- An elven arrow
- A dead snowy owl, frozen stiff
- A gleaming scale from a young white dragon
- A fist-sized stone from Kelvin's Cairn

![The ghosts of ancient frost giant jarls sit in judgment over all who would disturb their rest](img/adventure/IDRotF/125-02-014.ghosts.webp)

### Leaving Jarlmoot

As the characters leave Jarlmoot, read the following boxed text to the players:

>>Through the blowing snow, you see a frost giant with long white hair stride toward you. In her hands, she grasps an icy chain with an anvil bolted to one end of it.
>>

The **frost giant**, Gromin'gorn, is hostile and has noble blood in her icy veins. She has come to Jarlmoot to be tested by the spirits of her ancestors. Only by passing this test can she hope to lead her tribe. If one of the characters is openly carrying the *horn of blasting* from area J4, Gromin'gorn tries to claim it for herself, believing this is the test her ancestors have set before her.

Instead of a greataxe, Gromin'gorn wields a 10-foot-long chain with an anvil bolted to the end of it. In her hands, it deals 25 (3d12 + 6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. She can make two attacks with it as an action.

## Karkolohk

A goblin prison-fort clings to an icy crag in the rocky, wind-blasted western foothills of the Spine of the World. From this ramshackle mountain roost, the goblins launch raids against caravans traveling to and from Ten-Towns and mount hunting expeditions across the tundra.

Any of the following hooks might lure characters to the gates of Karkolohk:

- The characters learn about the goblin fortress while they're in Ten-Towns (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns").
- Sherriff Markham Southwell of Bryn Shander hires the characters to bring him the head of the goblin chief, Yarb-Gnock (see "Peace Out" and "Gnome Diplomacy" below).
- The characters follow a goblin wagon heading back to Karkolohk (see "Foaming Mugs").
- The characters find a shield guardian's amulet in the Lost Spire of Netheril (see "Lost Spire of Netheril") and use its tracking feature, which leads them to Karkolohk, where the shield guardian is found.

### Secret of Chief Yarb-Gnock

Ruling a goblin horde is a thankless job. That's a hard lesson for a rock gnome sorcerer to learn.

Five years ago, before Icewind Dale became the perpetually frozen hellscape it is today, **Spellix Romwod** was traveling through the mountain pass with a small caravan when it was caught in an avalanche. The goblins who triggered the avalanche captured Spellix's mates and dragged them back to their caves in the mountains to be eaten. Spellix, whom the goblins overlooked, followed them and devised a cunning plan to free his companions. Using materials scavenged from the wrecked caravan, he engineered a costume for himself. Disguised as a half-metal goblin, he infiltrated the goblins' lair and did his best to fit in, cleverly using *silent image* spells to hide the imperfections in his disguise. When he was offered a bone to gnaw on, his mechanical goblin mouth malfunctioned and wouldn't stop grinding its teeth. Thus, **Spellix Romwod** came to be known as Yarb-Gnock, which means "Ever-Gnawing" in Goblin.

Spellix was repulsed by the goblins' squalor and took pity on them. Abandoning all concern for his former mates, whom he didn't particularly like anyway, Spellix adopted the name given to him by the goblins and spent the next several months engineering ways to improve their standard of living. Long after the other members of the caravan had been eaten, Yarb-Gnock became the new chief after the previous one choked to death on a mountain goat tongue. By then, Yarb-Gnock had already drawn up plans to build a fortress in the mountains. Karkolohk, the Gnomish word for "home," became the goblin tribe's dream of a better future.

As the goblins were finishing construction of their new home, everlasting winter descended upon Icewind Dale. Fewer caravans made their way through the mountain pass, forcing Chief Yarb-Gnock to send goblin wagons far and wide in search of food and resources. Despite his best efforts, the gnome-in-goblin's-clothing could sense that the tribe was becoming increasingly frustrated. The goblins felt like they were working harder for less, and a few are beginning to suspect that Chief Yarb-Gnock is a fraud.

Cooped up in the cold with creatures that would kill him if they learned the truth, Chief Yarb-Gnock is running out of ideas to keep the goblins motivated on other tasks and has begun to fear that the goblins are on to him. His costume is beginning to come apart, and paranoia has made him sleep-deprived. The number of "traitors" hurled from the mountaintop increases with every cycle of the moon, and the goblins don't know who among them are Yarb-Gnock's loyal spies. Mistrust has infected every nook and cranny of Karkolohk.

**Spellix Romwod** was beginning to think that the time had come to abandon his goblin kin and seek refuge in Ten-Towns when, two days ago, his fortunes improved suddenly. Goblins out scavenging in a wagon stumbled across a curious object in the tundraÃ¢ÂÂa metallic, egg-shaped crate. (This object was jettisoned from an illithid nautiloid soon before it crashed in the mountains to the east, as described in "Id Ascendant"), Chief Yarb-Gnock thinks the crate might hold something wondrous, and getting it open has become his new obsession.

### Karkolohk Overview

The goblins of Karkolohk often haunt the trail that connects Ten-Towns to other settlements farther south, though it sees little traffic nowadays. Prisoners are kept in dangling cages until they freeze to death, whereupon the goblins cook and eat them.

Deep tracks left by goblin wagons lead to and from Karkolohk, making it easy to find despite the heavy snowfall. Once the characters are within the foothills and travel high enough to breach the clouds, the fortress becomes visible about from a mile away.

The fortress is worked into the spur of a mountain slope in a way that uses the natural environment to its advantage. Situated at the top of a hill, goblin lookouts have an excellent view of anyone approaching.

The weather in the mountains is so violent that Karkolohk's structures occasionally come loose and crash down the mountainside. Other times, chemistry experiments gone awry send wooden structures up in flames. Thus, the fort is always bustling with construction and repairs.

#### Goblin Mindset

Chief Yarb-Gnock has taught the goblins to seize their destiny and stop at nothing to get what they want. Opportunistic creatures that they are, they take any sign of weakness as an opening to gain an advantage. If bullying and intimidation don't work, the goblins use more underhanded and passive-aggressive tactics. If they think that they are at a disadvantage or that they will come to an unavoidable loss, the goblins will do whatever they can to backtrack out of such a situation, be it through bribery, wheedling, or treachery.

Visitors are not welcome at Karkolohk. Moreover, the goblins who live here detest non-goblins, especially gnomes. Were the goblins just a little smarter, they would see through Chief Yarb-Gnock's crude disguise and the magic he uses to hides its imperfections, and tear **Spellix Romwod** limb from limb.

#### Gnome Diplomacy

If you decide to use the "Peace Out" quest (see "Peace Out"), the characters are treated as diplomats by the goblins and permitted to approach and enter the fortress unmolested, provided they do no harm to its inhabitants. Assuming they avoid a violent altercation, the characters are escorted by a **goblin** to Yarb-Gnock's dining hall (area K11) for a private feast with the chief. This feast consists of a cooked mountain goat. What happens next depends on Yarb-Gnock's goal, which can be one of the following:

- If Yarb-Gnock's goal is to make peace with Ten-Towns, he gives the party a rolled-up strip of rabbit hide at the end of the meal. On this strip of hide he has written a brief, formal notice in Common addressed to the Council of Speakers of Ten-Towns. It asserts that the goblins of Karkolohk will refrain from attacking travelers and caravans heading to and from Ten-Towns for as long as the peace treaty between Ten-Towns and Karkolohk lasts, and it bears Yarb-Gnock's signature at the bottom. After handing them the message, Yarb-Gnock urges the characters to leave at once and deliver it to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander.
- If Yarb-Gnock's goal is to flee Karkolohk, the meal concludes with Yarb-Gnock requesting that the characters escort him to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander. Mistaking any attempt by Yarb-Gnock to leave Karkolohk as an abduction orchestrated by the characters, the goblins attack the characters as they try to flee the fortress with Yarb-Gnock in tow. During this escape attempt, Yarb-Gnock fights only in self-defense, counting on the characters to deal with any goblins that get in the way.

![Map 2.9: Karkolohk](img/adventure/IDRotF/128-map-2.9-karkolohk.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/129-map-2.9-karkolohk-player.webp)
### Karkolohk Locations (K1-K7)

The following locations are keyed to map 2.9.

#### K1. Watchtowers

The fortress has three of these squat structures, two overlooking the eastern approach and a third perched atop the cliffs to the west. Each watchtower stands 20 feet tall and has a rickety wooden ladder leading to the top, where a thick column of smoke issues from a brazier that is kept lit at all times.

Four **goblins** dressed in cold weather clothing stand guard atop each tower. The rampart battlements grant them half cover against attacks from outside the fort. They are supposed to be looking outward for signs of trouble, but the goblins prefer to stand around the brazier for warmth. One goblin has a horn that it can blow to sound an alarm, putting the entire fortress on alert.

Since visitors aren't welcome at Karkolohk, the goblins shoot arrows at any they see. A character who wants to sneak past a watchtower or climb its ladder undetected must succeed on a DC 9 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If multiple party members are attempting the same task, have them make a group check instead.

#### K2. Main Gate

>>A fiery brazier casts its flickering light on the thirty-foot-high, spiked ramparts that frame the main gate. Four goblins peer down from these ramparts, two per side. The gate is twenty feet tall and fashioned out of crosshatched pieces of wood that have been lashed together. A heavy chain and padlock seals the gate from the inside.
>>

Six **goblins** shiver and stamp their feet atop the ramparts, trying to keep warm. They are a chatty bunch, making jokes at one another's expense. Each rampart has a wooden ladder leading up to it.

A character who wants to approach the gate undetected must succeed on a DC 9 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If multiple party members are attempting the same thing, have them make a group check instead. A character next to the gate can use an action to reach through it and try to pick the frozen padlock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The courtyard warden (see area K3) carries the key to the lock.

A Small character can try to squeeze under the gate or between its wooden bars, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

#### K3. Courtyard

>>Two rickety wooden bridges loom over this area at heights of thirty feet and fifty feet, respectively. The higher bridge is missing a large section of its middle, and what remains of that structure doesn't look safe.
>>
>>Two iron cages hang from beams that extend southeast off the lower bridge. One of the cages twirls on its heavy iron chain as a flurry of black-feathered ravens tear into the flesh of the desolate creature caged within. Underneath the bridge is a worg with a rider on its back. The rider, swathed in cold weather clothing, appears to be a rather fat goblin. North and west of the higher bridge, resting in the snow, are three large, wooden cages, currently empty.
>>

The wooden cages were built to hold the polar bears that pull the goblins' wagons.

The **goblin** riding the **worg** is Snubsuk, the courtyard warden. His job is to lock and unlock the main gate at area K2. The worg charges toward intruders, causing Snubsuk to tumble off the worg's back and fall prone in the snow. Snubsuk is a coward and flees when separated from his mount, making his way to the top of area K5. Snubsuk carries the key to the main gate, dangling from a chain manacled to his left wrist.

***Bridges and Cages.*** The center of the 50-foot-high bridge collapsed a few days ago. The goblins used the debris to light fires and haven't fixed the bridge yet. The 30-foot-high bridge is intact and unguarded. One of the cages hanging from it contains a prisoner: a dead human that the ravens are feasting on.

#### K4. Archer Platforms

These wooden platforms creak and groan underfoot. Each of them has two **goblins** in cold weather clothing and two **wolves** stationed atop it.

If an alarm sounds, the goblins begin looking for targets on the ground to pick off with their shortbows. If the enemy moves to a location the goblins can't see, they mount the wolves and move to another archer platform.

#### K5. Main Battle Platform

>>This thirty-foot-tall wooden watchtower is connected to the snowy ridges on either side of it by wooden bridges. Hanging off it are a pair of empty iron cages, and dangling underneath the tower's raised platform is a nine-foot-tall, golem-like construct with a helm-shaped head. This humanoid contraption is attached to an arrangement of ropes and pulleys that make it look like a giant marionette.
>>

When announcements or rallying cries need to be made, the top of this tower is where Chief Yarb-Gnock stands to address the goblin tribe. No goblins are on it currently, although it sees a fair amount of traffic. A rickety wooden ladder runs from the platform to the ground. The underside of the platform is rigged with a system of ropes and pulleys that the goblins can use to hoist up anything heavier than a goblin, and the top of the platform has snow-covered hatches built into it that can be lifted away to get at the rigging underneath.

***Dangling Construct.*** The construct dangling beneath the platform is a **shield guardian** that survived the fall of Ythryn, although its master did not. It was heavily damaged in the crash; consequently, its hit point maximum is reduced to 80. To activate and control the shield guardian, the characters need its amulet, which is inside an ancient tower that broke away when Ythryn came down and crashed in the tundra (see "Lost Spire of Netheril"). They also need to operate the goblins' system of pulleys and ropes to lower it to the ground; figuring out how the system works requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.

The shield guardian was built by a Netherese wizard and is nearly two thousand years old. Carved into its massive forearms is the wizard's personal sigil. After the wizard's tower crashed, the guardian left the spire to go find help but got buried in an avalanche. It eventually shut down. Centuries later, a band of goblins dug it out and hauled it back to Karkolohk. Unfortunately for them, the guardian could not be reactivated. After some thought, Chief Yarb-Gnock decided to dangle it from this platform, using ropes and pulleys like puppet strings to make the guardian appear animate and terrifying. This construct must have been a lively sight to behold at one point, but the aura of menace surrounding it quickly faded, and the goblins lost all interest in it.

#### K6. Healers' Huts

>>On a wide, snow-covered shelf, six conical tents fashioned from animal skins and bark draped over wood frames are arranged in a circle around a burning brazier.
>>

Each hut is home to a **goblin** healer in cold weather clothing. Each one owns a healer's kit. In addition, each healer has a pet **mountain goat** (see *appendix C*), from which it draws milk and which it can use as a mount. Each goat is usually tied to a post inside the healer's hut.

***Manafek.*** The goblin healer in the easternmost hut is named Manafek. She also tells fortunes by studying patterns of raven's blood spilled on the snow. She is wise enough to have seen through Chief Yarb-Gnock's disguise and is contemplating whether to blackmail the rock gnome or expose him. She's leaning toward the former, since she's not sure the goblins will pick her as their new leader if Yarb-Gnock dies.

#### K7. Walk of Doom

>>A twenty-foot-long wooden walkway clings to the edge of a precipice. Its spiked railings are adorned with ribbons of shredded cloth and goblin skulls.
>>

Whenever Chief Yarb-Gnock wants to make an example of a goblin, the poor wretch is dragged screaming to this walkway. The goblin can either hurl itself off the cliff to its death or die by the swords of its kin. The skulls belong to goblins who never made it to the end of the walkway. Ravens have picked the skulls clean.

The walkway was shoddily constructed and shows signs of having been repaired many times after being damaged by wind. If more than 200 pounds is placed on the outermost half of it, the whole thing snaps off and tumbles down the mountainside. Any creature on the walkway when it breaks off must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature leaps off and falls prone on the ground near the slope. On a failed save, the creature falls 150 feet onto icy rocks with goblin bones scattered among them, taking 52 (15d6) bludgeoning damage from the impact.

### Karkolohk Locations (K8-K13)

#### K8. Goblin Huts

>>Ramshackle huts cling precariously to the rock face, their rope ladders swaying with every gust of wind.
>>

These huts are secured to the rock face with stilts. Each hut is 15 to 20 feet above the path of wooden planks that runs the length of the ledge below them. The huts' interiors are lined with animal pelts and thick strips of bark. Each hut contains an adult **goblin** and 1d6 goblin children (noncombatants).

When the fortress comes under attack, the goblins who live here pull up their rope ladders, which makes getting to the huts difficult. A creature can reach a hut by scaling the icy cliff, but doing this requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### K9. Main Keep Foyer

Four **goblins** in cold weather clothing guard this drafty hall. If an alarm sounds, the guards drop a heavy wooden crossbar across the double door to the south until Chief Yarb-Gnock gives the order to remove it. A ram or a similar siege weapon is needed to break down the barred door.

#### K10. Guard Barracks

These rooms are furnished similarly with mangy furs heaped atop hammocks made from old fishing nets. No goblins are resting here when the characters arrive.

#### K11. Dining Room

A low banquet table dominates this room, and there are no chairs as goblins are expected to sit on the floor. The table and floor are strewn with fish bones, bits of rotting meat, and other refuse left over from previous meals. No one ever cleans this place.

Characters who undertake the "Peace Out" quest (see "Peace Out") are brought here to meet and dine with Chief Yarb-Gnock. The characters are expected to wait here until Spellix dons his Yarb-Gnock costume and emerges from his quarters (area K12). He engages in small talk until the food arrives about 10 minutes later.

When the room is not in use, a lone **goblin** stands guard inside the room near the eastern door, which is sealed shut with a wooden crossbar and has a shuttered peephole at goblin eye level. If someone knocks on the other side of this door, the guard peers through the peephole to see who's there. If it sees a friendly face, it lifts the crossbar and opens the door. A character can use an action to try to force open this door from the other side, breaking the crossbar with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check. When the dining room is in use, the guard retires to the barracks (area K10).

#### K12. Chief's Quarters

The door to this room has three deadbolts. A character can use an action to try to force open the door, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength check. **Spellix Romwod** (see the accompanying stat block) quickly dons his disguise if someone knocks on the door or tries to break it down, but it takes him 1 minute to do so. While putting on his goblin costume, Spellix makes light conversation (in Goblin) through the closed door to buy time.

![{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF}](img/adventure/IDRotF/130-637357081755196775.webp)

The following boxed text assumes that Spellix has had time to don his disguise before the characters open the door. If they catch him in the act, modify the description accordingly:

>>This ten-foot-square room features two wooden shelves that hold half-dismantled objects and other junk. In the middle of the room, an odd-looking goblin in cold weather clothing stands next to a metallic, egg-shaped crate as big as he is. Nearby is a small, fur-lined cot and a brazier full of hot coals.
>>

Characters who search the junk on the shelves find a set of tinker's tools and three trinkets (determined by rolling on the Icewind Dale Trinkets table in *appendix A*).

If the characters clearly portray themselves as enemies of the goblins, Spellix removes his goblin mask so that the characters don't mistake him for an enemy. If asked how he ended up in his current predicament, Spellix tells them he's a method actor training for the role of a goblin warlord in a play. (He can't help himselfÃ¢ÂÂhe lies about everything.)

The characters can easily force Spellix to do what they say, since they are clearly mightier than his goblin horde. While in his Yarb-Gnock disguise, Spellix can be used as a hostage to facilitate the characters' escape, or he can command the goblins to stand down and allow the characters to leave the fort unmolested. If Manafek (see area K6) is still alive, she might show up unexpectedly with a goblin posse and expose the impostor, forcing Spellix to put his fate in the characters' hands. If the characters surrender the gnome to the goblins, Spellix is hauled away to take the Walk of Doom (see area K7), and the characters are free to go without further incident.

***Egg-Shaped Crate.*** Made of magical metal, this indestructible container is 3ÃÂ½ feet tall and 3 feet wide, with a flat base that allows it to stand upright and seams at the top that suggest it opens like a flower. Though it looks smooth, its surface feels tacky. It weighs 250 pounds and has a panel of flashing lights below its bulging midsection. The panel is a nine-digit keypad locking mechanism, and each glowing button has braille-like bumps on it. Spellix was unable to remove the keypad or crack open the crate, so he has been trying different combinations on the lock.

The characters won't be able to crack the eight-digit combination quickly, so the easiest way to open the crate is to cast a *knock* spell on it or pay someone in Ten-Towns to cast the spell (see "Magic in Ten-Towns").

Unlocking the crate causes the **gibbering mouther** contained inside it to spill out. It attacks all other creatures indiscriminately.

#### K13. Treasury

This small room is empty.

## Lost Spire of Netheril

Buried in the tundra is the spire of a tower that broke away from the Netherese city of Ythryn when it fell from the sky nearly two thousand years ago. The spire shattered into pieces as it embedded itself in the earth, upside down. There it has remained for centuries, buried under snow and ice.

The Netherese wizard who lived inside the spire did not survive the crash. The wizard's shield guardian not only survived but also dug its way out, creating a tunnel that others can use to reach the spire's interior. Until recently, the mouth of this tunnel was buried under ice and snow. After exiting the spire, the shield guardian wandered into the Spine of the World, where it shut down and was lost for centuries until a band of goblins found it recently and brought it to their mountain fort (see "Karkolohk").

The characters can learn about the spire in Ten-Towns (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns"), or they might stumble upon it accidentally while hunting (see "Hunt for the Red Yeti"). The NPC who tells the tale is willing to guide the characters to the spire's location for no less than 20 gp. After doing so, the guide wishes the party luck before heading back to Ten-Towns.

Before the characters face the challenges of the spire, review the information about Dzaan in the "Arcane Brotherhood" section of *appendix C*. The details concerning **Dzaan's simulacrum** and bodyguard are especially pertinent, given what the characters are about to discover.

### Not-So-Dead Wizard of Thay

Dzaan instructed his simulacrum to remain in the spire and ordered Krintaas, his **wight** bodyguard, to watch over it. The simulacrum is keen to activate the rune chamber on the lowest level (area P16), because this room's magic can transform an illusory creature or object into a real one (within limits). The **simulacrum** thinks it can use the rune chamber to turn itself into a flesh-and-blood clone of Dzaan, but activating the chamber requires a life-spark, which the simulacrum does not possess. Krintaas, who also lacks a life-spark, is impatiently waiting for Dzaan to return and quash the simulacrum's efforts to test the rune chamber. Neither the simulacrum nor Krintaas is aware that the real Dzaan is dead (see "Toil and Trouble").

When the characters show up, **Dzaan's simulacrum** is ecstatic. Finally, some potentially helpful living creatures have arrived! The simulacrum will bargain, befriend, threaten, or do whatever else it thinks might work in order to get one or more of them to accompany it to the rune chamber. If the characters know that the real Dzaan is dead and convey that information to the simulacrum, it becomes even more determined.

Once it learns that Dzaan is dead, Krintaas does whatever it takes to make sure the simulacrum gets the life-spark it needs to activate the rune chamber.

### Approaching the Spire

When the characters come within sight of the section of the spire that's visible on the surface, read:

>>A twenty-foot-high, irregularly shaped spur of rock juts out of the tundra ahead of you. Its smooth and shiny surface cannot possibly have been worn down by the wind. No, this protrusion looks utterly out of place, as if it had been thrust into the ground.
>>

A character who examines the protrusion can make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check to discern its nature. (The dwarves' Stonecunning trait can prove useful here.) On a successful check, the character can confirm that the stone is neither naturally formed nor manually hewn, but rather shaped by magic. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also discerns that that the protruding rock is of the top of a larger structure that continues underground.

#### Slippery Entrance

Characters who search the area around the protrusion find a slippery, 5-foot-diameter tunnel that enters the ground at a steep angle, then winds down into the frozen earth. A character moving through the tunnel without the aid of climbing gear or magic must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or slide uncontrollably to the bottom, landing prone in area P1 but taking no damage. Characters can forgo climbing and simply slide down the tunnel, with a similar result. Getting back to the surface requires climbing gear or magic.

### Lost Spire Overview

In addition to showing the four levels of the spire, *map 2.10* depicts a side view of the spire in its original state and a cross-section showing its current state: broken, mostly buried, and upside down.

The spire's constant features are summarized below:

- **Everything Is Upside Down.** Every traversable location shown on map 2.10 is upside down. To get around, the characters have to walk on ceilings and climb over the tops of doorways. Furnishings that weren't securely bolted to the walls or floor lie in disarray, or in shards, on the ceiling.

***Illumination.*** All rooms, corridors, and staircases are lit by *continual flame* spells cast in sconces. The flames still point toward the ceiling, betraying their magical nature. They give off no heat.

- **Room and Door Heights.** All rooms and passageways are 12 feet high, with flat ceilings and floors unless the text says otherwise. All doorways are 8 feet high and arched; being upside down turns them into concave, 4-foot-high barriers that must be surmounted to get from one room to another).
- **Tunnels.** The shield guardian punched holes through the floor and gouged out tunnels in some places during its escape from the spire. Characters can use these openings to move between levels, but they'll need ropes or magic to ascend or descend safely.

![Map 2.10: Lost Spire of Netheril](img/adventure/IDRotF/131-map-2.10-lost-spire.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/132-map-2.10-lost-spire-player.webp)
### Lost Spire Locations (P1-P8)

The following locations are keyed to map 2.10.

#### P1. Upside-Down Entrance

>>The slippery tunnel opens into an upside-down room, the contents of which are coated in frost. Across from the tunnel is a wooden door that's flush with the ceiling, which used to be the floor. The door is ajar, and flanking it are two identical stone statues that hang down like stalactites. Across from the statues are sconces with upside-down flames burning in them.
>>

The statues, which merge seamlessly with the ceiling, depict a long-faced human dressed in wizard's robes and clutching a staff. The statues used to have magical wards on them, but these protections faded long ago.

#### P2. Upside-Down Corridor

The upside-down stairs at the east end of this frost-filled corridor once connected to area P9, but the passage is so choked with rubble and ice that it can't be used.

#### P3. Upside-Down Library

>>Tall bookshelves affixed to the outer wall have spilled their contents onto the ceiling-turned-floor. A large table lies on its side, one leg broken. A five-foot-wide tunnel in the floor to the east leads down.
>>

Most of the books in this library have been destroyed by time and neglect. The group of adventurers Dzaan hired to help him search the spire removed all the books they considered valuable, including spellbooks. They left behind a few that might interest certain characters:

*Magical Wonders of Netheril.* This book is a collection of interviews with Netherese archmages, who discuss their studies of ancient elven magic and the creation of *mythallars* (see *appendix D*). The book includes sketches of such devices.

*Mysteries of the Phaerimm.* This book sheds light on the phaerimmÃ¢ÂÂtelepathic, funnel-shaped monsters of malevolent intellect that lurk in the UnderdarkÃ¢ÂÂand includes disturbing sketches of them.

*Wizards in the Hollow.* The birth of the Netherese empire is chronicled in this otherwise dull, plodding story about the lives of three Netherese wizards.

***Tunnel Down.*** A rough-hewn tunnel against the north wall leads down to area P6 on level 2.

#### P4. Upside-Down Workshop

>>This room contains shattered and jumbled equipment, much of it near two heavy wooden worktablesÃ¢ÂÂone on its side, the other upside down.
>>

Characters who search through the wreckage find an iron key that unlocks the metal chest in area P5.

#### P5. Upside-Down Potion Storage

>>The floor of this room is covered with shards of glass, frozen pools of spilled fluids, and the wreckage of two cabinets. In a niche in the far corner of the room, a metal chest is bolted to the ceiling. Its lid is locked.
>>

The key to the chest can be found in area P4. A character using thieves' tools can pick the chest's lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

***Treasure.*** Characters who open the upside-down chest must be careful not to let its contents fall out. The chest contains four *potions of resistance* (one each of acid, cold, fire, and force). If no precautions are taken, the potions tumble out of the opened chest and shatter on the floor, becoming useless. Any character underneath the chest can try to catch a falling potion using a free hand, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

#### P6. Upside-Down Laboratory

>>This room contains two metal cages, both badly damaged. Nearby, two roughly dug tunnelsÃ¢ÂÂone in the ceiling and one in the floorÃ¢ÂÂlead to other areas. Narrow windows along the bowed outer wall afford you a glimpse of the earth into which this structure impaled itself.
>>

The metal cages got knocked around a lot during the crash and fall apart easily. One of them holds the carapace of an insect-like person. A character who examines this object and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check can identify it as coming from a thri-kreen.

***Tunnels Up and Down.*** Rough-hewn tunnels in the middle of the room lead up to area P3 and down to area P11.

#### P7. Upside-Down Apprentices' Study

>>An upside-down table sits in the middle of this room, and books are scattered around it. Clinging to the bowed outer wall is an upside-down fireplace. Along that same wall is a window with nothing but hard-packed earth beyond it.
>>

The members of the previous expedition searched through the books and plucked the best ones. Characters who thoroughly examine the remaining ones can find a couple of interest that are salvageable:

*Ajamar's Guide to the Phantastic.* This breezy, lighthearted treatise on illusion magic was required reading in many Netherese classrooms. It describes clever ways to use common illusion spells.

*The Unfettered Mind*. This lunatic text discusses how one might exist solely as a disembodied brain, preserved for eons in a magical suspension fluid. It includes sketches of brains in jars.

![A dwarf adventurer explores the upside-down spire of a lost city](img/adventure/IDRotF/133-02-021.dwarf.webp)

#### P8. Upside-Down Reading Room

>>This room contains the shattered remains of a desk and some chairs. You quickly discover that all sound is muted here.
>>

A permanent *silence* spell encompasses this room, which apprentices used for quiet study. The effect can be dispelled (DC 18).

### Lost Spire Locations (P9-P16)

#### P9. Collapsed Staircase

This staircase once connected to area P2 on level 1, but the passage is too choked with rubble and ice to be used.

***Dead Apprentice.*** Partially buried under the rubble is a human skeleton in tattered robesÃ¢ÂÂthe remains of an apprentice who died in the crash. Characters who examine the skeleton notice that one of its bony fingers is missing. A previous explorer noticed a ring on the finger, couldn't remove it, and decided to break off the whole finger instead.

#### P10. Rubble-filled Spiral Stairway

This spiral staircase used to connect levels 2 through 4 but is choked with rubble, rendering it impassable.

#### P11. Upside-Down Laboratory

>>This chamber appears to have been a wizard's laboratory, as evidenced by the upside-down storage cupboards and empty shelves fastened to the walls, the shattered glass and alchemical equipment strewn across the floor, and the arcane symbols painted on what is now the ceiling. In the middle of this space, five-foot-wide passageways punched through the ceiling and floor lead to other levels. Near them, a partially collapsed wall exposes a room that lies beyond.
>>

The gap in the west wall was made by members of a previous expedition, after they discovered a secret door that they couldn't get open. The secret door was reduced to rubble, creating a gap in the wall leading to area P13. **Dzaan's simulacrum** (see *appendix C*) and its **wight** bodyguard, Krintaas, are in area P12 and move to investigate any loud disturbances here.

***Treasure.*** Any character who spends a few minutes picking through the detritus finds a small brass key (which unlocks the invisible chest in area P15) and a sealed scroll tube made of chardalyn (see the *chardalyn sidebar*). It contains a *spell scroll* of *invisibility* stamped into a rolled-up piece of golden foil. The chardalyn tube is safe to handle.

#### P12. Snow and Shadow

Unless they're drawn to area P11 by a disturbance, **Dzaan's simulacrum** (see *appendix C*) and its **wight** bodyguard, Krintaas, are here. Omit the second paragraph from the following boxed text if these NPCs are not present:

>>Some effort has been taken to arrange the contents of this upside-down room, creating a functional office. A table stands in the middle of the room, surrounded by small stacks of books. Lying on the table is a whirring amulet on a chain.
>>
>>Two figures stand behind the table. One is an undead warrior in studded leather armor, its dead-gray flesh drawn tightly over its bones and its face locked in a terrible scowl. The other is an attractive young man in cold weather clothing. His face, beneath a frayed witch's hat, displays studious eyes and a warm smile. "Welcome to the lost spire of Netheril," he says. "My name is Dzaan."
>>

Characters who watched Dzaan's fiery execution (see "Toil and Trouble") recognize the young man as DzaanÃ¢ÂÂback from the dead, or so it seems. The simulacrum, on the other hand, has never met the characters before. To earn their trust, it tries to be honest and forthcoming. It is self-aware enough to know what it is, but it can't grow or learn in its current form. It asks the characters to help it become a flesh-and-blood creature like the wizard who created it. It knows nothing about Dzaan's fate or the crimes for which the real Dzaan was executed.

In the course of a conversation, the simulacrum shares the following information:

>>"I am a simulacrum of my creator. This tower is but a fragment of a Netherese flying city that crashed nearly two thousand years ago and lies somewhere under the glacier.
>>
>>"On the lowest level of this inverted tower, my creator found a chamber that can turn illusions into reality. The life-spark of a living creature is needed to activate its power. As a creation of snow and shadow, I have no life-spark of my own, and Krintaas, my undead bodyguard, is of no help in this regard. I assure you, the chamber can in no way harm anyone."
>>

**Dzaan's simulacrum** lacks a spellbook. If attacked, its impulse is to turn invisible and flee, then use its *levitate* spell to ascend the tower while Krintaas covers its escape. If it escapes the spire, it makes its way to Ten-Towns; as a thing made of ice and snow, the simulacrum can cross the tundra without fear of freezing to death.

![Guardian Amulet](img/adventure/IDRotF/134-02-022.shield-guardian-amulet.webp)

***Amulet.*** The object on the table is the amulet for a **shield guardian**. Dzaan retrieved it from area P15 and brought it here for examination. Neither the simulacrum nor Krintaas know what the amulet does, nor do they care. The simulacrum will happily give it to the characters if one or more of them agrees to accompany it to the rune chamber on the lowest level. A *detect magic* spell reveals a magical aura of enchantment around the amulet.

The amulet is a 4-inch-wide disk composed of silver-framed wood, with a rune carved into its face. (This rune matches the one on the shield guardian's forearms and is the personal sigil of the wizard who created both.)

This particular *shield guardian amulet* is a rare magic item that requires attunement, and only humanoids can attune to it. A humanoid that attunes to the amulet knows the distance and direction of the shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian are within 10 feet of each other. The amulet otherwise functions as described in the shield guardian's entry in *Monster Manual*.

***Books.*** The simulacrum has been picking through the spire's wreckage and gathering books that might be useful. Characters can find the following readable titles among the stacks of worthless, damaged books on the floor:

*Lost Scrolls of Sabreyl.* Written in Elvish, this scholarly tome copies and analyzes fragments of eight ancient scrolls left behind by a sun elf wizard who taught magic to the cloud giants of Ostoria, a bygone empire that collapsed 40,000 years ago.

*From Shadow, Substance*. This speculative work discusses how one might harness the Weave to turn an illusory object or creature into its real counterpart, with commentary and criticism from noteworthy Netherese illusionists.

*Here Lies the King.* This elaborately plotted novel features an illusionist who uses magic to impersonate a prince, supplant a king, rule a fictional kingdom for sixty-one years, and fake his own death.

*Ventatost*. This book uses testimonials and conspiracy theories to piece together events leading up to the destruction of a Netherese city called Ventatost, which disintegrated as it flew over the forest of Cormanthor nearly two thousand years ago, before the fall of Ythryn.

#### P13. Upside-Down Shrine

Characters who peer through the gap in the east wall see what looks like a shrine without much decoration or flair:

>>A stone altar is attached to the ceiling of this otherwise empty, semicircular room. An eight-pointed star is carved into the eastern face of the altar.
>>

Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognize the symbol on the altar as the holy symbol of Mystryl, the first incarnation of Mystra, the god of magic. If this check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows that holy shrines to Mystryl are rare places and often full of mystery.

***Altar.*** The altar hangs 9 feet above the "floor" and merges seamlessly with the "ceiling" to which it's attached. A *detect magic* spell or similar magic does not reveal the magical aura around the altar, which is protected by a permanent version of the *Nystul's magic aura* spell that conceals its magical nature. If a successful *dispel magic* is cast on the altar (DC 18), followed by a *detect magic* spell or similar magic, it radiates an aura of illusion magic.

The first time a character who can cast spells touches the symbol of Mystryl carved into the front of the altar, a stoppered flask filled with a luminous blue liquid appears in a shimmer of light "atop" the altar and immediately falls, shattering on the ceiling-turned-floor unless someone within reach catches it. Catching the falling flask requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If more than one character succeeds on this save, the one who rolled highest is the one who catches it. If the flask shatters, its contents evaporate instantly. Only one such flask can be created, after which the altar becomes nonmagical.

A character can use an *identify* spell or similar magic to determine the properties of the blue liquid in the flask. Any creature that drinks all of it gains the ability to cast the *minor illusion* cantrip at will, using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability. If the creature that drinks the liquid can already cast the *minor illusion* cantrip, or if the liquid is consumed by more than one creature, nothing happens and the gift is wasted.

#### P14. Upside-Down Refectory

This room is where the old tenants of the spire gathered for meals. Characters who befriended **Dzaan's simulacrum** are warned about the creature in this room:

>>Rusty tableware, shattered plates, and broken chairs lie scattered on the floor amid two tables, one overturned and one on its side.
>>
>>Crawling out from behind the tipped-over table is a hulking, eight-legged reptile with glowing eyes.
>>

A hostile **basilisk** is holed up in this room, having crawled down into the spire a few weeks ago.

#### P15. Upside-Down Bedchamber

>>The bed in this room is upside down on the floor, its rotted blankets peeking out from underneath the disintegrating mattress. Mounted to the north wall is a tall, cracked mirror in a stone frame that merges seamlessly with the surrounding wall.
>>
>>Lying underneath two dirt-clogged windows is a partially crumbled, rime-covered human skeleton in the tattered shreds of a nightgown.
>>

The crumbling skeleton is all that remains of the Netherese wizard to whom this tower once belonged. Disturbing the remains causes the wizard's evil spirit, a **will-o'-wisp**, to appear and attack. If the will-o'-wisp loses more than half its hit points, it uses its next action to turn invisible and haunts the characters for the remainder of their time in the spire, attacking solitary targets or those who can't fight back easily. The will-o'-wisp is bound to the spire and can't leave it, nor can it be appeased.

The mirror mounted on the north wall can be broken or taken down. Characters who slipped past the basilisk can use the mirror to reflect the basilisk's gaze.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the room thoroughly find a chest behind the bed. The chest has been made invisible by a spell that can be ended with a successful *dispel magic* (DC 18). The chest has a built-in lock, the key to which can be found in area P11. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock as an action, doing so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check (with disadvantage if the character can't see the lock).

The chest weighs 25 pounds. It is airtight, watertight, and magical, such that its interior is a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). It can be sold for as much as 100 gp.

Inside the chest is what appears to be an ancient, leather-bound spellbook that bears a rune on its spine identical to the one that appears on the shield guardian's control amulet in area P12. The spellbook disintegrates a few seconds after the chest is opened. Whatever spells it once contained are forever lost.

#### P16. Upside-Down Rune Chamber

>>The walls of this chamber are inscribed with interconnected runes and marred with cracks. What is now the ceiling bears similar inscriptions that swirl inward, converging around a golden crystal disk five feet in diameter.
>>

A *detect magic* spell or similar magic reveals an aura of transmutation magic encompassing the entire room. The first time someone enters the room, read:

>>An illusory figure appears upside down in the far corner of the room, standing on the ceiling. It appears to be the same long-faced human wizard depicted in the statues just inside the spire's entrance. It begins speaking in a strange, possibly forgotten, language.
>>

Casting *dispel magic* on the illusory figure causes it to vanish. Otherwise, it disappears after giving its little speech. Once it goes away, the figment can't be summoned again for 24 hours.

Any creature that can understand Loross, the language favored by the wizards of Netheril, can translate the illusory wizard's words as follows:

>>"Behold my masterpiece! Here can illusions be made real, shadows become substance! Create your illusion, let it stand atop the crystal disk, and watch my rune chamber do its work!"
>>

**Dzaan's simulacrum** can't learn anything new by studying the runes and crystals. However, any character who spends at least 1 minute doing so can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, verify their purpose: to transform illusory creatures and objects into real ones. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows the following:

- The rune chamber can't produce magic items, animated objects, constructs, or undead.
- A life-spark is needed to turn an illusory creature into a physical one. Acting much like a spark of electricity, it gives the room the jolt it needs to complete the transformation. (No such component is needed for objects.)
- The cracks in the walls have damaged enough of the runes to compromise the room's magic, which might give rise to unexpected results. (Warning **Dzaan's simulacrum** about this risk does not discourage it from using the rune chamber.)

***Illusory Objects.*** When one or more illusory objects are placed under the crystal disk, the disk gives off a soft golden light. Roll percentile dice and consult the Rune Chamber Effect table to determine what happens next. Treat multiple illusory objects (for example, an illusory pile of coins) as a single collective object and roll once on the table for all of them.

***Illusory Creature.*** When an illusory creature stands beneath the crystal disk, the disk gives off a soft golden light. However, nothing happens until a living creature touches the illusory one. When that happens, roll percentile dice and consult the Rune Chamber Effect table to determine what happens next.

If **Dzaan's simulacrum** becomes real, see the "Dzaan Lives!" section below.

##### Rune Chamber Effect
|  d100 | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 91Ã¢ÂÂ00 | The object or creature ceases to be an illusion and becomes real permanently. A creature brought into being in this way is under the DM's control and uses whichever stat block best matches its form. In addition, the damage to the runes causes the crystal disk to burn out, making the chamber no longer functional. |

### Dzaan Lives!

If the rune chamber works properly and the simulacrum becomes a true clone of Dzaan, the wizard thanks the characters for their help and asks them not to discuss what has happened with anyone in Ten-Towns. See Dzaan's description in *appendix C* for information about modifying the simulacrum's stat block to account for its transformation into a clone of Dzaan. Krintaas remains by Dzaan's side as his faithful, undead bodyguard.

Dzaan's ultimate goal is to plunder Ythryn. Without his spellbook, however, the wizard is woefully underpowered. Concealed under layers of cold weather clothing, Dzaan and Krintaas must travel to Bryn Shander to obtain a blank spellbook, as well as writing supplies and provisions. In the meantime, Dzaan urges the characters to seek out and destroy his rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood. Dzaan assumes his rivals are hiding out in Ten-Towns and paints an unflattering portrait of each one:

- "**Avarice** is a tiefling evoker who delights in destruction. Her weakness is her paranoia. She can't bring herself to trust anyone except maybe her two gargoyle companions, and even they are suspect."
- "Nass Lantomir is a human diviner. She likes to pry knowledge from others by reading their thoughts. Her weakness is that she's always looking ahead, never behind her."
- "**Vellynne Harpell** is a human necromancer, as cold and uncaring as the corpses she animates. She's a withered old fool whose greatest assetÃ¢ÂÂher family nameÃ¢ÂÂdoes her no good in Icewind Dale."

### Bugbear Incursion

Before the characters leave the spire, six **bugbears** crossing the tundra stumble upon the protrusion in the snow and slide down to area P1. Once there, they begin searching the uppermost level for food and treasure. The bugbears are cold and shivering, and their growls and complaints can be heard throughout the spire as they get their bearings.

The bugbear leader, Brekk, is a thug whose allegiance can easily be bought. Brekk and his gang serve anyone willing to feed them, and their loyalty can be bought with coin (2 gp per day per bugbear). Characters who have no interest in fighting the bugbears or hiring them as muscle can pay them 10 gp each to leave the spire at once and continue on their merry way.

## Reghed Tribe Camp

Reghed tribe camps are scattered throughout Icewind Dale. None of them appear on maps because they don't stay in one place for long.

Each Reghed tribe is made up of smaller clans, each with its own chieftain (the most powerful of whom often carries the title of king or queen). A clan might set up its camp for a tenday or two, then dismantle it and go back on the move, allowing the clan to stay close to a migrating herd of **reindeer** as it travels across the tundra.

The characters might be drawn to a Reghed camp by a tall tale or a quest (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns" and "Wolf Tribe Cannibals"), or they might be led to a camp by Reghed scouts roaming the tundra (see "Wilderness Encounters"). The characters might also visit Reghed camps in *chapter 5*, as they face tests set before them by Auril the Frostmaiden.

Before the characters find one of these camps, review the information on the Reghed tribes and their leaders in appendix C. While it's not unheard of for clans of the same tribe to commingle and build their camps close to one another, the four tribes avoid contact with one another. Members of one tribe are rarely found in another tribe's camp unless some sort of diplomacy is taking place.

### Approaching a Camp

As the characters approach a Reghed tribe camp, read:

>>Splayed across the tundra ahead of you is a campsite with more than a dozen tents arranged in two concentric rings, with the larger tents clustered near the middle. Between the tents burn several campfires. The air around the camp smells of cooked meat, and you can hear the barking and howling of dogs. Off to one side, outside the perimeter of tents, several empty sleds are clustered together.
>>
>>Hulking figures dressed in thick hides and holding spears patrol the camp perimeter, looking outward for signs of danger. Other figures are gathered around fires or moving among the tents.
>>

Six **tribal warriors** walk the perimeter. These guards tend to be younger warriors of the tribe.

A lone character can sneak into the camp undetected with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If multiple characters try to sneak in together, have them make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) group check instead. If either check fails, the guards shout loud enough to put the camp on alert (see "Camp Roster" below).

Reghed nomads, regardless of clan or tribe, try to capture intruders rather than kill them, giving the chieftain (or king or queen) the chance to question or punish them, as appropriate.

Although most Reghed tribe members are human, you can include nonhumans as well.

#### Camp Roster

The following tribe members are usually in the camp:

**Chieftain**. Roll a d6. On a 6, replace the chieftain with the tribe's king or queen (described in appendix C). Otherwise, the chieftain of this clan is a **gladiator** in hide armor who speaks Common and has Survival +5.

**Great Warrior**. Serving the chieftain as a bodyguard and executioner is a **gladiator** in hide armor who speaks Common and has Survival +5. This great warrior is often the chieftain's spouse, sibling, offspring, or childhood friendÃ¢ÂÂsomeone the chieftain trusts.

**Shaman**. The shaman, who advises the chieftain and presides over spiritual matters, is a **druid** who speaks Common and Druidic, and has Survival +4. In public, the shaman dons a wooden mask carved in the likeness of a bear, an elk, a tiger, or a wolf, as befits the tribe.

***36 Hunters and Warriors.*** This number includes the perimeter guards. All are **tribal warriors** who speak Common and have Survival +4. Half of them are asleep in the camp at any given time.

- **24 Noncombatants.** These are children and elders who are too weak to fight. Half of them are asleep in the camp at any given time.

***36 Sled Dogs.*** Use the **wolf** stat block. The sled dogs usually sleep with the warriors in the outer circle of tents.

#### Hunting Parties

Between two and four hunting parties, each consisting of 1d6 + 4 **tribal warriors**, are away when the characters arrive. Each one returns after 2d4 hours with fresh meat (such as a **reindeer** carcass).

### General Layout

*Map 2.11* depicts a typical Reghed camp, which consists of an inner circle of large tents called the chief's circle and an outer ring of smaller tents called the warriors' circle. Scattered among these tents are campfires around which members of the clan like to gather. The tents are crude yet sturdy structures with wooden frames and walls made of layered bark and animal hides. A large tent can accommodate up to eight adults, and a smaller tent can provide shelter for up to five adults.

The tents in the inner circle house the clan's chieftain (or its king or queen), as well as other important tribe members such as its shaman, its most honored hunter, its greatest warrior, and the tribe's children.

The tents in the outer circle house the clan's remaining members, which include crafters, weaponsmiths, and sled drivers. Sled dogs also sleep in these tents.

Many of the camp's hunters and warriors prefer to sleep under the open sky, protected from the cold by thick fur blankets and the heat of the campfires.

#### Chieftain's Tent

One of the larger tents is set aside for the chieftain (or king or queen), with an extra bedroll near the entrance for the chieftain's bodyguard. A low table is set up in this tent, which is heated by lamps burning whale oil and decorated with hunting trophies.

#### Shaman's Tent

Another large tent is occupied by the shaman, who keeps a large collection of medicinal herbs.

***Treasure.*** In addition to the medicinal herbs, the shaman's tent contains 1d4 *potions of healing* in plain wooden vials sealed with corks made of animal fat, as well as a *spell scroll* of *lesser restoration* (or some other 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the druid spell list).

![Map 2.11: Reghed Tribe Camp](img/adventure/IDRotF/135-map-2.11-reghed-camp.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/136-map-2.11-reghed-camp-player.webp)
### Life in a Reghed Camp

The Reghed nomads eke out a meager existence on the desolate tundra of Icewind Dale, yet this is a life to which they are accustomed. Auril's everlasting winter has made hunting and travel more challenging, to be sure, but the tribes are weathering these difficult times by rationing their food and letting nothing go to waste. If anything, the Frostmaiden's cruelty has hardened the nomads' determination to survive. By following herds for their food and occasionally restocking on wood, the Reghed can get by without relying on trade. They shun Ten-Towns and expect to prevail long after those feeble lights of civilization have been snuffed out.

A Reghed camp is a somber and subdued place, except for the barking of sled dogs and the sounds of children playing in the snow. The warriors and hunters like to conserve their strength for when it's needed, preferring to spend their idle hours doing as little as possible. Telling familiar stories and inventing new ones that glorify the nomads' outlook on life are common pastimes (see the "Reghed Stories" sidebar), as is sharpening weapons.

Food is critical, of course, and certain beasts of the tundra are staples among the Reghed tribes. Knucklehead trout and seals are often prepared for eating very near the scene of the kill, filleted or chopped and generally eaten raw. **Reindeer** meat, on the other hand, must be cooked before consumption. **Reindeer** also provide the Reghed tribes with sinew, bone, and hide, all of which are used in the manufacture of weapons and armor.

> ##### Reghed Stories
>
>Reghed nomads pass the time by sharing stories that reinforce their values, which are as follows:
>
>- The tribe is one spirit, always on the move. As the tribe goes, so goes the spirit of the tribe.
>- For the tribe to survive, its members must all work together and help one another. No member gets left behind.
>- The land respects strength alone. The strong flourish, and the weak perish.

## Revel's End

Revel's End is a panopticon, a prison configured in such a way that the activities of the prisoners can be closely monitored from a central location. Situated on the frigid, misty coast of the Sea of Moving Ice, the prison is a single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison's administrative offices and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower are carved out of a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower against the brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.

One can approach Revel's End by land, sea, or air. A pier allows prisoners to be taken from ships up an elevator to the prison, and a mooring dock at the top of the tower allows prisoners to be delivered by airship as well.

Revel's End is controlled by the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederation of settlements whose current members include the cities of Baldur's Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar; the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle; and the dwarven stronghold of Mithral Hall. To be imprisoned in Revel's End, one must have committed a serious crime against one or more members of the alliance and been sentenced to a lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more). Moreover, the offender must have political connections that make incarceration in another facility less dependable. Captured spies, for example, are often brought here to cool their heels.

Each member of the Lords' Alliance assigns one representative to Revel's End, and together they form a parole committee called the Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since Revel's End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities. If the council needs a tie-breaking vote to determine whether to commute a prisoner's sentence, the prison wardenÃ¢ÂÂa neutral arbiter with no ties to any Lords' Alliance memberÃ¢ÂÂcasts the deciding vote.

![The remote prison of Revel's End contains many of the Sword Coast's most dangerous criminals](img/adventure/IDRotF/137-02-023.revels-end.webp)

### Involving the Characters

The characters might be lured to Revel's End by one of the tales or quests at the start of this chapter that have to do with Vaelish Gant (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns" and "Behind Bars"). This villain last appeared in *Legacy of the Crystal Shard*, a published adventure also set in Icewind Dale. *Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden* presupposes that Vaelish Gant's plot to take over Ten-Towns was thwarted, and that he has been incarcerated at Revel's End for a few years before the start of this story.

The characters might also come to Revel's End hoping to book passage on a ship, as such vessels are known to bring prisoners and supplies to the prison. A ship can take them to Auril's island (see *chapter 5*) or allow them to flee the Far North altogether.

### Prison Features

The prison, hewn from stone, has 20-foot-high outer walls and flat, 20-foot-high ceilings throughout. Additional information about the prison is summarized below:

***Doors and Hatches.*** Each door and rooftop hatch is made of reinforced iron held shut by an *arcane lock* spell. Prison personnel can open these doors and hatches normally. A locked door or hatch is too strong to be shouldered or kicked open, but it can be destroyed if it takes enough damage. A door or hatch has AC 19, a damage threshold of 10, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

- **Heating.** Interior spaces are magically heated. The temperature in these areas is a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).

***Lighting.*** Unless the text for a location states otherwise, all courtyards, corridors, rooms, and staircases are brightly lit by *continual flame* spells cast on wall sconces. (The cells in area R17 are exceptions.) In some locations, the magical lights can be dimmed or suppressed, as noted in the text.

***Prison Guards.*** The prison has a garrison of 75 guards (use the **veteran** stat block) who work eight-hour shifts. Two-thirds of the garrison is off duty and resting in area R19 at any given time. While on duty, each guard wears a tunic that bears the Lords' Alliance emblem: a gold crown on a red field.

***Prisoners.*** All prisoners in Revel's End are identified by a number. This simple protocol makes it harder for prisoners to identify one another and helps keep them on an equal footing. Prison personnel commit these numbers to memory, and the records of all prisonersÃ¢ÂÂpast and presentÃ¢ÂÂare stored in area R22. Each inmate wears a uniform that consists of a hoodless robe without pockets, leather slippers without laces, and cloth undergarments. While outside their cells, they wear manacles on their wrists and ankles.

### Approaching the Prison

Use the following boxed text to describe what characters see as they approach the prison by land, sea, or air:

>>Perched on a high cliff overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice is a bleak stone fortress carved out of a gigantic, blade-shaped rock. A central tower looms above the rest of the fortress, and light leaks from its arrow slits. Four smaller towers rise from the outermost corners of the fortress, and guards can be seen atop them.
>>

Characters approaching from the north can also see the prison's northern entrance at the top of a 160-foot-high cliff with a pier protruding from its base. A giant wooden crane stands nearby, and a wooden scaffold clings to the cliff face.

Characters approaching from the south can also see the prison's south entrance and the trail that leads up to it.

#### Guards on Watch

The prison has four guard towers (see area R9), and three guards (**veterans**) in cold weather clothing are stationed atop each one. If you need to make Wisdom (Perception) checks for the guards to determine if they notice something, there's no need to roll separately for each of them. Just make one roll with advantage.

If the guards on a tower see or hear something out of the ordinary, such as an approaching ship or group of visitors or a monster flying overhead, one guard descends into the tower to alert the rest of the prison while the others stay at their post.

#### Getting Inside

Characters who bang on the prison's north or south door are admitted into a 30-foot-long entry corridor, where they are greeted by the three guards (**veterans**) stationed in the nearby guard room (area R3). These guards insist on confiscating the characters' weapons. In addition, one guard searches each character for concealed weapons. A character can conceal a dagger or similarly sized weapon from a guard's notice with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

If the characters have sled dogs or pack animals, a guard grants the party access to the stables (area R5), where the animals can be kept safe. Animals aren't allowed in the prison otherwise.

After relinquishing their weapons and securing their animals, the characters are escorted by one of the guards to the meeting room (area R12), where the warden greets them soon thereafter. The warden (see area R21) tries to find out why the characters are at Revel's End and decides whether to help them or not. If the characters fail to provide a satisfactory reason for their visit, the warden sees that their weapons and animals are returned to them before throwing them out. Legitimate reasons for coming to Revel's End include the following:

- The characters seek shelter. The warden will grant them temporary accommodations (in area R7) for up to two days and two nights, and the characters receive three meals a day during their stay.
- The characters wish to meet with a prisoner. The warden can facilitate such a meeting by having the prisoner brought to area R12 for questioning. The warden is always present for such meetings.

### High Alert

When a matter of concern is brought to her attention, the warden (see area R21) decides whether to place the prison on high alert. Circumstances that warrant taking such action include a prisoner revolt, an escape, the approach of an unfamiliar ship, a dragon sighting, or an attack.

By speaking the command word "maristo," the wardenÃ¢ÂÂand only the wardenÃ¢ÂÂcan put the prison on high alert, with the following effects:

- For 1 minute, the sound of a klaxon blares throughout the prison, and all *continual flame* spells in the prison take on a reddish hue.
- The guards in area R19 don their armor, arm themselves, and move to area R18. The warden does the same and commands the garrison from there. Members of the Absolution Council retreat to area R20.
- The warden and all prison guards gain the benefit of a *see invisibility* spell.

### Revel's End Locations (R1-R8)

The following locations are keyed to map 2.12.

#### R1. Pier

Ships dock here to offload prisoners and supplies.

#### R2. Elevator

A sturdy wooden scaffold clings to the 160-foot-high cliff separating the prison from the pier. Looming above the scaffolding is a wooden crane that is controlled from area R3. The crane raises and lowers an elevator car that has a retractable wooden gate on the side opposite the crane. The elevator car is a hollow wooden cube measuring 10 feet on a side. It takes 1 minute for the car to travel all the way up or down the scaffold.

#### R3. Guard Rooms

Three guards (**veterans**) are stationed in each of these two rooms. The guards pass the time by playing cards, sharpening their weapons, and complaining about the interminable winter.

Embedded in the north wall of the northern guard room is an iron lever that raises and lowers the elevator in area R2.

#### R4. Hospital

This chamber contains a dozen beds. Cabinets along the north wall hold enough medical supplies to assemble twenty healer's kits.

#### R5. Stables

Visitors who brings mounts, sled dogs, pack animals, and pets to Revel's End can keep their animals here. They must provide their own food, however.

#### R6. Mess Hall

Prison personnel dine here. Tables and benches fill the room, and dishes and cutlery are stored in cabinets along the south wall. Meals are served every four hours.

#### R7. Councilors' Quarters

These ten rooms are furnished identically. Each contains a bed, a desk with matching chair, a claw-footed chest, and wall hooks for hanging clothes. The *continual flame* spell that illuminates each room can be suppressed or returned to its normal light level by uttering a command word ("lights").

These rooms are set aside for the ten members of the Absolution Council, though only three rooms are currently in use. The other seven members of the council are absent, so the warden is free to let visitors use the spare rooms.

***Council Members.*** These three members of the Absolution Council are at Revel's End currently:

- **Councilor Voss Anderton.** Voss represents the city of Neverwinter. He is a lawful neutral human noncombatant who has a precise, lawyerly way of speaking. He takes his role seriously and never misses a council meeting or parole hearing. He votes with his head, not his heart, and always carefully weighs the ramifications of commuting a prisoner's sentence.
- **Councilor Jil Torbo.** Jil represents the city of Baldur's Gate. She is a neutral halfling noncombatant who loathes her job. She has no sense of humor and a habit of sighing deeply when her patience is tested. She likes giving others the benefit of the doubt, however, perhaps as an act of dissent, and votes yes on commutations more often than not.
- **Councilor Kriv Norixius.** Kriv represents the town of Daggerford. He is a lawful good dragonborn noncombatant of silver dragon ancestry. He hopes to impress the Duchess of Daggerford by doing a good job. He has no compassion for criminals and always votes no on commutations.

#### R8. Kitchen and Side Rooms

Six cooks (noncombatants) take shifts here, working in pairs to produce meals for the prisoners and staff. The kitchen contains everything one would expect to see, as well as an iron stove and a pump that draws water from a magically heated cistern on the roof.

Off-duty cooks sleep in the largest of the three rooms west of the kitchen. This side room is lit by *continual flame* spells that can be suppressed or returned to normal light levels by uttering a command word ("lights").

The middle side roomÃ¢ÂÂnot heated, unlike the rest of the prisonÃ¢ÂÂis used for cold storage.

The smallest side room is a well-stocked pantry.

### Revel's End Locations (R9-R16)

#### R9. Guard Towers

Each of these four triangular towers is two stories tall. A tower's interior chamber is empty except for a wooden ladder that climbs to an iron hatch held shut by an *arcane lock* spell (see "Prison Features"). This hatch leads to the tower's flat rooftop, which is lined with battlements. Three Lords' Alliance guards (**veterans**) in cold weather clothing are stationed on the roof of each tower.

#### R10. Armory

This room contains wooden racks and chests filled with nonmagical weaponry. The inventory includes twenty *halberds*, fifteen *longswords*, fifteen *shortswords*, ten *pikes*, ten *heavy crossbows*, five *light crossbows*, and hundreds of *crossbow bolts*.

The armory is guarded by a **spectator** that treats the weapons as treasure. It knows every member of the prison staff on sight. It won't leave the room and attacks anyone it doesn't recognize.

***Hatch.*** A wooden ladder leads to an iron hatch in the ceiling. An *arcane lock* spell seals the hatch (see "Prison Features"), which opens onto the roof.

#### R11. Courtyards

The ground in each of the two courtyards is covered with flagstones and drifting snow.

When the weather allows, prisoners are brought hereÃ¢ÂÂindividually or in small groupsÃ¢ÂÂfor fresh air and exercise. They are watched closely by guards on the ground as well as the guards on the corner tower.

#### R12. Meeting Room

This room holds a large, rectangular table with a single chair on one long side and three similar chairs on the opposite side. The room is used for meetings with prisoners or the warden.

***Hatch.*** A wooden ladder leads to an iron hatch in the ceiling. An *arcane lock* spell seals the hatch (see "Prison Features" page 155), which opens onto the roof.

#### R13. Storeroom

Supplies are stored here in crates and other containers. At present, the prison has stockpiled enough necessities to continue operations for six months.

#### R14. Privy

This room contains a dozen wooden waste buckets. Once per day, usually in the morning, guards order prisoners to carry the buckets outside and dispose of the waste.

#### R15. Hexagon

This corridor allows guards and visitors to access the outermost rooms of the prison while avoiding the panopticon (area R16) and its prison cells (area R17). The guards refer to this corridor as the hexagon because of its shape.

#### R16. Panopticon

The *continual flame* spells that light this area can be dimmed from the surveillance hub (area R18). The hall is dimly lit at night.

### Revel's End Locations (R17-R23)

#### R17. Cells

The prisoners are kept in these unlit cells behind barred gates that can be opened only from area R18. The gates are too secure to be forced open using brute strength or weapons, and magical attempts to open or bypass them are thwarted by permanent antimagic fields. Each field encompasses one cell and its gate. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in an antimagic field and can't protrude into it. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Bolted to the back wall of each cell is an iron bunkbed with a thin mattress atop it and a waste bucket nearby. Prisoners take their meals in their cells.

***Prisoners.*** Each of the twenty-four cells can hold one or two prisoners. Roll 4d12 to determine the number of prisoners currently incarcerated at Revel's End, give each one an identification number, and distribute them in the cells as you see fit. Numbers are assigned in the order in which the prisoners arrive and are never reused. The longest-serving prisoner currently incarcerated at Revel's End is Prisoner 6, and the newest one is Prisoner 299. Characters who want to speak with Vaelish Gant must arrange a meeting with **Prisoner 237** (see "Prisoner 237: Vaelish Gant").

To add detail to some of the inmates, roll on the Prisoners table or choose entries that interest you. If a prisoner's game statistics become necessary, choose an appropriate stat block from *appendix B* of the *Monster Manual* and remove armor, weapons, and other gear.

##### Prisoners

#### R18. Surveillance Hub

This hexagonal room is the base of the prison's central tower. A spiral staircase connects it to the tower's upper levels (areas R19 through R23).

Seven guards (**veterans**) are stationed in this surveillance hub. One sits at a console south of the staircase. The other guards watch the prisoners, whom they can observe through 4-foot-tall, 1-foot-wide arrow slits in the walls. Hanging on the walls between the arrow slits are fifty sets of iron manacles that guards use to bind prisoners' wrists and ankles.

***Console.*** The console is a magic device bolted to the floor that resembles a small desk with a slanted top. It is a Large object with AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The console has the following magical properties, which are disabled if it is reduced to 0 hit points:

- **Gate Control.** Twenty-four switches on the console open and close the gates to the prison cells. A twenty-fifth master switch opens or closes all the gates at once. Flipping one or more switches on the console requires an action.

***Light Control.*** A brass dial on the console controls the light level in area R16, which can be dimmed or restored to its normal brightness. Turning the dial requires an action or a bonus action.

- **Loudspeaker.** Anyone who speaks into a flaring brass protrusion resembling the bell of a trumpet while pressing a button on the console can broadcast their voice throughout the prison. Using the loudspeaker requires an action.

#### R19. Guard Barracks

Characters who climb the spiral staircase come to a door 100 feet above the prison roof. The staircase continues beyond this door to the tower's higher levels.

The door opens into a room filled with wooden bunkbeds. Areas to the north, west, and south can be scanned through 4-foot-tall, 1-foot-wide arrow slits. The *continual flame* spells that light the room can be dimmed or brightened by uttering a command word ("lights").

When the prison is not on high alert, fifty guards (**veterans** without armor or weapons) sleep in the bunks. The guards keep their armor and weapons within easy reach. Other belongings are kept in unlocked footlockers tucked under the bunkbeds.

The guards need 10 minutes to don their armor. If the prison is put on high alert, the guards take the time to put on their armor before making their way down to area R18.

#### R20. Hall of Absolution

The floor of this room is 120 feet above the prison roof. A spiral staircase connects the room to the other levels of the tower (area R18 is 140 feet down, area R19 is 20 feet down, and area R23 is 20 feet up). Narrow windows line the outer walls.

A long, slightly curved table takes up much of the room. Eleven chairs are situated behind the table. The middle chair has no special adornments, while the others have banners hanging over their high backs, each one emblazoned with the crest of a Lords' Alliance member. Banners hanging on the walls display the alliance's emblem, a golden crown on a red field.

***Absolution Council Meetings.*** Members of the Absolution Council gather here to weigh the merits of releasing prisoners whom one or more council members have recommended for parole. No prisoner can receive such consideration more than once a year. Prisoners up for parole are brought to this room in manacles and given a chance to sway the council members before votes are cast. The warden (see area R21), who always attends such meetings, sits in the middle chair and casts the tie-breaking vote, if necessary.

#### R21. Warden's Quarters

The *arcane lock* on this door can be opened only by the warden. Beyond the door is a comfortable bedchamber lit by a *continual flame* spell that can be dimmed or brightened by uttering a command word ("vaudra").

***Prison Warden.*** The warden of Revel's End is Marta Marthannis, a lawful good human **mage** who speaks Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, and Orc and has a calm, unflappable disposition. She wears a red robe with gold trim and keeps a ring with seven tiny keys hanging from it in one pocket. One key unlocks the warden's chest (see "Treasure" below); the others unlock the desk drawer and the cabinets in the warden's office (area R22).

Warden Marthannis is secretly a member of the Harpers, a faction that works behind the scenes to keep power out of the hands of evildoers. In her current position, she works to keep some of the Sword Coast's worst malefactors behind bars.

So far, the warden has managed to conceal her Harper affiliation from everyone else in the prison. But she has an unusual problem that she can't hide as easily. Lodged inside her is the spirit of a deceased adventuring companionÃ¢ÂÂa lawful good shield dwarf fighter named Vlax Brawnanvil. The spirit of Vlax takes control of Warden Marthannis once or twice a day, each time for an hour or two. While under its control, the warden can't cast her prepared spells, speaks only Dwarvish, and occasionally indulges Vlax's vice for ale and spirits. She also becomes moody and temperamental, though never resorts to violence without good cause.

Warden Marthannis knows that to rid herself of Vlax's spirit, she must visit the Brawnanvil crypts in Gauntlgrym, a dwarven fortress under Mount Hotenow (near Neverwinter). Only there can the spirits of Vlax's kin persuade Vlax to join them in the afterlife. The warden refuses to make the journey, however, because she can't bear to lose all contact with Vlax. The warden has made her affliction known to the prison guards and Absolution Council members, and they have grown accustomed to her personality changes and bouts of drunkenness.

***Treasure.*** Among the chamber's furnishings is a locked wooden chest, for which the warden carries the only key. A character using thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

The chest holds a set of calligrapher's supplies, a sack containing 750 gp (money that's used mainly to pay ship captains who drop off prisoners and cargo), and a silver cloak pin (25 gp) bearing the symbol of the Harpers, a tiny harp nestled between the horns of a crescent moon.

Any character who searches the chest for secret compartments finds one in the lid. It holds a *wand of binding* that the warden keeps for emergencies.

#### R22. Warden's Office

Prison records are stored here in five locked wooden cabinets along the east wall. The cabinets contain ship cargo manifests and records of past deliveries, as well as prisoner transfer orders and files documenting the names, crimes, sentences, and commutations of every prisoner who has been incarcerated at Revel's End. The records also include death certificates for prisoners who died while incarcerated. The cause of death is always given as "natural," "accidental," or "unnatural," with no details.

A desk in the middle of the room has ten financial ledgers packed into a locked side drawer. The keys for the desk and the cabinets are in the warden's possession. A character with thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the lock on the desk drawer or one of the cabinets, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check.

#### R23. Tower Roof

This flat rooftop is 140 feet above the prison roof and 300 feet above sea level. Three 6-foot-high walls to the north, southwest, and southeast provide limited cover, but much of the rooftop is exposed to the elements.

A wooden drawbridge can be lowered on one side to create an airship dock. An action is required to raise or lower the drawbridge.

No guards are stationed here. If the guards in the prison watchtowers (area R9) see an airship or an airborne threat approaching Revel's End, they alert the rest of the prison. The warden then dons cold weather clothing and heads to the roof to greet the airship crew or deal with the airborne threat herself.

### Prisoner 237: Vaelish Gant

**Vaelish Gant, Prisoner 237** within the walls of Revel's End, is a member of the Arcane Brotherhood who first engaged in criminal activity by insinuating himself into the trade network of Ten-Towns. He hoped that his work would help the Arcane Brotherhood gain control of the region. A few years ago, shortly after his arrival in Ten-Towns, Gant established a protection racket in Bryn Shander and tried to turn the town against its speaker, Duvessa Shane, with the goal of supplanting her. He also tried to destabilize the economy of Ten-Towns. A party of adventurers thwarted his criminal ventures by capturing him.

Rather than put Gant to death for his crimes in Icewind Dale, the Council of Speakers in Ten-Towns made a deal with representatives of the Lords' Alliance to have Gant serve a life sentence in Revel's End, so as not to incur the Arcane Brotherhood's wrath. The Council of Speakers did this not realizing that Gant's scheme wasn't sanctioned by the Arcane Brotherhood but rather hatched by Gant himself, who intended to impress his superiors by pulling it off.

For a long time, Gant held out hope that the Arcane Brotherhood would apply pressure to secure his release, and that the Lords' Alliance would acquiesce to the brotherhood's demands rather than risk an all-out attack on Revel's End. But by now, Gant has been incarcerated long enough to reasonably conclude that no such rescue is forthcoming. His failed scheme was an embarrassment to the Arcane Brotherhood, which has clearly forsaken him.

![{@creature Prisoner 237|IDRotF}](img/adventure/IDRotF/140-637357081739596776.webp)

#### Roleplaying Vaelish Gant

Vaelish Gant is a mage who specializes in the arcane tradition of abjuration. Pompous and conniving, he never doubts that he's the smartest person in the room, and he makes sure everyone around him knows how he feels.

Gant has neither a spellbook nor material components for spellcasting, and he can't avail himself of his magic while locked in his cell due to the antimagic field that encompasses it.

Gant spends his days and nights thinking about one thing: his freedom. If the characters meet with him, Gant tries to convince them to break him out of jail, promising wealth and magic items once delivered safely to the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan. Gant doesn't expect the characters to oblige, but he has nothing left to lose but his life.

Although he's unaware of any Arcane Brotherhood activities in Icewind Dale, Gant suspects that something is afoot if the characters start asking him about the organization. The last time he was at the Hosttower, shortly before his arrival in Ten-Towns a few years ago, Gant overheard his superiors talking about mounting an expedition to Icewind Dale, to search for a lost Netherese city buried under the Reghed Glacier. Gant had different plans for Icewind Dale at the time, but now the characters' visit gives him reason to believe an expedition might finally be under way. Gant shares this information with the characters if they show him the letter from Duvessa Shane (see "Behind Bars") or break him out of prison.

Gant has no information that can help the characters find the lost Netherese city, but he's willing to share what he considers to be common knowledge about the Empire of Netheril:

- Netheril was a civilization ruled by powerful wizards. It fell more than a thousand years ago.
- The Netherese learned their magic first from the elves, and later from the fabled *Nether Scrolls*. Netherese magic was far more powerful than present-day magicÃ¢ÂÂso much so that it made even the gods tremble.
- Evil, subterranean creatures known as phaerimm were instrumental in Netheril's fall, but it was hubris that ultimately spelled the empire's doom. Karsus, a Netherese archmage, tried to usurp the power of Mystryl, god of magic. He failed, destroying himself and tearing the Weave in the process. It would be years before anyone could use or control magic again.

If the characters ask Gant about other members of the Arcane Brotherhood they've met in Icewind Dale (see appendix C), Gant can share what he knows about any of them:

- About **Avarice**, Gant says: "The tiefling albino? I think she has a promising future."
- About Dzaan, Gant says: "He's a Red Wizard of Thay. Need I say more?" (If asked to elaborate, he adds: "Dzaan doesn't shave his head or wear red robes, but that doesn't change the fact that he's Thayan. The Red Wizards want the Weave all to themselves. If they get their way, no one else will be able to use magic.")
- About Nass Lantomir, Gant says: "She's a nobody."
- About **Vellynne Harpell**, Gant says: "Had powerful members of her family not pulled strings to get her into the Brotherhood, that old scarecrow would still be reanimating dead cats in Longsaddle."

## Skytower Shelter

Skytower Shelter is one of two goliath settlements described in this chapter, the other being Wyrmdoom Crag (see "Wyrmdoom Crag"). Read both entries before running encounters in either location. Also review the "Goliaths" entry in *appendix C*, in particular the "Spine of the World Goliaths" section. There is also a list of goliath names you can draw from, as needed.

Characters might visit Skytower Shelter to resolve a long-standing dispute between the two goliath clans (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns" and "A Goliath Problem"). Or a goliath player character who hails from Skytower Shelter might return home for some reason, perhaps to seek help with matters concerning Icewind Dale.

All goliaths who dwell in Skytower Shelter are members of the Akannathi clan. In addition to their feud with the goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag, Skytower goliaths are known for their fierce competitiveness, their dislike of strangers, and their mastery of griffon taming.

### Into the Mountains

To get to either of the goliath outposts or to move between them, the characters need to negotiate the Spine of the World, where travel is the most difficult of any region in Icewind Dale. Use the rules in the "Mountain Travel" section to simulate the perils of getting around in the peaks.

![Map 2.13: Skytower Shelter](img/adventure/IDRotF/141-map-2.13-skytower-shelter.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/142-map-2.13-skytower-shelter-player.webp)
### Skytower Shelter Locations

Skytower Shelter is a cave complex carved into the northwest face of a 15,000-foot-high mountain. Tunnels are 10 feet high throughout, and the caves are lit by torches.

The following locations are keyed to map 2.13.

#### S1. Stone Causeway

A 10-foot-wide stone causeway hugs the side of the mountain and ascends to Skytower Shelter. Six **griffons** circling the mountain's peak watch the causeway closely, and their eyesight is sharp enough to pierce the clouds that frequently shroud the mountaintop. If they see unfamiliar figures ascending the causeway, the griffons shriek warnings to the goliaths of Skytower Shelter. The goliaths quickly arm themselves, expecting trouble. If the shelter comes under attack, the griffons join the fray.

#### S2. Barricade and Chieftain

>>Six griffons circle above you, shrieking at your approach. They descend until they're a few hundred feet away but come no closer.
>>
>>At the end of the entranceway is a ten-foot-tall barricade made of wood and stone, set with a crude gate made of thick lumber and festooned with metal blades. Gaps in the gate allow you to see an unusually tall figure in hide armor standing ten feet behind it and clutching a greataxe. Beyond this figure is a higher ledge with five equally towering figures standing atop it.
>>

The figure beyond the gate is a **goliath warrior** (see appendix C) named Arn Rockfist Akannathi, the chieftain of Skytower Shelter. The figures atop the overlook (area S3) are five more **goliath warriors**.

If the party includes one or more goliath characters who hail from Skytower Shelter, Arn welcomes them home and allows them and their companions to pass through the gate unmolested. Otherwise, Arn tells the party in a deep and gravelly voice, "Turn back. You are not welcome here."

Two 500-pound wooden bars seal the gate. The blades affixed to the gate and the surrounding barricade make climbing impossible. The goliaths attack anyone who bypasses the gate without Arn's consent. Nine **goliath warriors** from area S9 join the fray on the third round, and the six **griffons** circling above join the battle on the fifth round. Arn can also whistle to summon these reinforcements at any time.

***Roleplaying Arn.*** Arn has no patience for attempts at diplomacy and meets aggression with aggression. If the characters don't have one or more Skytower goliaths among them, the only way they can get past Arn is to give him something he wants. If the characters ask him what he wants, he tells them:

>>The goliath thinks for a moment, then points toward a neighboring mountain to the northeast. "Bring me the white cloak of Ogolai, the chieftain of Wyrmdoom Crag."
>>

If Arn is asked why the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths don't get along, he says:

>>"Many summers ago, the children of Skytower challenged the children of Wyrmdoom to a game of goat-ball. One of the children of Wyrmdoom, angered at being knocked off her perch, threw the ball at one of our griffons and struck it in the head. It wounded her in return. The game was called off. Days later, hunters from Wyrmdoom climbed our mountain and slew the griffon in its nestÃ¢ÂÂa grave insult. We have been at war ever since."
>>

Characters who speak to Ogolai, the chieftain of Wyrmdoom Crag, get a different version of the story (see "Wyrmdoom Crag").

If the characters portray themselves as neutral arbiters seeking to end the conflict between the clans, Arn suggests they end the conflict by bringing him the cloak of the Wyrmdoom chieftain, either by killing Ogolai and taking it from her or by forcing Ogolai to surrender it. Arn aims to use the characters as tools to weaken his rival and doesn't care if they succeed or die.

Only by restoring Kaniaka's sight (see area S4) can the characters convince Arn to meet with Ogolai and settle their differencesÃ¢ÂÂand only at Skytower Shelter or on neutral ground.

#### S3. Overlook

>>Five stoic goliaths stand guard atop a ten-foot-high, rocky outcrop with stairs leading up to it. A large, empty nest occupies one corner of the ledge, and two rough-hewn tunnels at the back of the ledge lead deeper into the mountain.
>>

Five **goliath warriors** (see appendix C) stand guard atop this overlook.

The griffon's nest contains a few bones (the remains of mountain goats) but nothing of value.

#### S4. Chieftain's Cave

>>This twelve-foot-high cave has a crackling fire in its center and walls lined with hunting trophies, including the skulls and pelts of various mountain-dwelling creatures. Seated by the fire is a wizened goliath with long white hair. A yeti fur cloak is draped over her stooped shoulders, and a tiger-sized feline with white fur crouches beside her.
>>

This cave is where Arn spends time with his family, namely his husband, Harad Cloudstrider Akannathi (a **goliath warrior**), and Harad's elderly mother, Kaniaka Stormcrow Akannathi (a blind noncombatant). Each of them has private quarters off the main cave, where they keep their bedrolls.

If the characters fought their way to this cave by killing other goliaths, Harad is awake and attacks them, since the fallen goliaths are his blood. Otherwise, Harad is asleep in his bedroll while Kaniaka sits by the fire, staring at it sightlessly, with a domesticated **crag cat** (see *appendix C*) by her side. The cat protects Kaniaka but otherwise takes no aggressive actions.

Kaniaka's hearing is sharp enough to distinguish the heavy footfalls of goliaths from those of smaller folk. She is suspicious of strangers just as other members of her clan are, but at her age, she feels compelled to listen to what they have to say. She would very much like to see an end to the conflict with the Wyrmdoom goliathsÃ¢ÂÂif such a thing is possible.

Magic can cure Kaniaka's blindness, and she becomes indebted to any character who restores her vision. Kaniaka is the only member of the Akannathi clan who has as much influence in Skytower Shelter as Arn does, and once her sight is restored, she can gently persuade him to listen to reason. With her help, the characters can convince Arn to meet with the chieftain of the Wyrmdoom goliaths, though he insists that any such meeting take place at Skytower Shelter.

Any conversation with Kaniaka awakens her son, who stumbles out of his bedchamber with greataxe in hand to confront intruders. If the characters have gotten off on the wrong foot with Kaniaka, Harad threatens to punish them for their intrusion, though his sense of honor dictates that he cannot draw first blood. Thus, he tries to goad characters into wounding him first.

#### S5. Shrine of Mind and Spirit

>>An eight-foot-tall stone inscribed with runes stands in the middle of this ten-foot-high cave. Nearby, a chute with carved footholds leads down.
>>

The chute is 5 feet in diameter and leads to area S6.

***Runestone.*** This engraved stone is one of two sacred stones in Skytower Shelter (the other is in area S7). The goliaths pray next to it when they seek clarity of mind and spirit. The scripture on the runestone, written in Dwarvish, tells a story about the vision and leadership found among the great predator birds of Icewind Dale.

A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the runestone. Any humanoid creature that prays or meditates next to the runestone for at least 1 hour gains a runestone die, a d6. Once within the next 24 hours, it can roll the die and add the number rolled to one Wisdom check or Charisma check it makes. It can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the runestone die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the runestone die is rolled, it is lost, and the humanoid can't gain another from this runestone for 10 days.

#### S6. Griffons' Cave

The floor of this cave is 15 feet beneath the floor of area S5. A 5-foot-diameter, 5-foot-long chute with carved footholds extends upward from the ceiling of this cave.

>>This fifteen-foot-high cave contains four griffon nests: three clustered in the middle of the cave and one to the north. The northernmost nest contains a full-grown griffon that appears to be sound asleep. The wind stirs the sleeping griffon's feathers as it enters through a wide opening in the north wall, beyond which you can see mountain peaks and storm clouds. Sitting on the edge of this opening is a goliath who is talking gently to a griffon youngling that leans against her.
>>
>>"Come no closer," warns the goliath. "This youngling is afraid to fly, and his mother is trying to get some rest."
>>

A smaller, 10-foot-high cave to the northeast contains a goliath-sized bedroll that belongs to the goliath. She is Rahi Skydreamer Akannathi, a **goliath warrior** with Animal Handling +4 and Medicine +4. Rahi serves as the clan's spiritual guide and chief caretaker of the griffons living in and around Skytower Shelter. The **young griffon** in her care is less than a year old and has yet to overcome its fear of flying. Its mother, a **griffon**, awakens and attacks if she, her offspring, or Rahi is threatened. If need be, Rahi can whistle to summon two more **griffons** perched on the nearby slopes; these reinforcements arrive on the third round of combat.

Like the other members of her clan, Rahi is distrusting of strangers and doesn't abide intrusions. A character who offers to help Rahi overcome the youngling's fear of flying can, with a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, get Rahi's permission to approach the youngling. That character can then attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to calm it. On a failed check, the youngling tries to nip the character with its beak, and Rahi sends the character away. On a successful check, Rahi is impressed as the baby griffon warms to the character.

If the party earns Rahi's trust and friendship, she might approach a goliath member of the party and offer to teach that character how to tame a griffon. Given the time commitment necessary, this activity is most likely to occur after the adventure concludes or during a lengthy period of downtime (see the "Griffon Taming" sidebar below).

> ##### Griffon Taming
>
>Goliaths of the Akannathi clan can learn to raise and tame griffons using secrets passed down through the generations. The clan's griffon trainer, Rahi, shares these secrets with clan members who show great wisdom. The goliaths don't ride the griffons; rather, they train them to hunt like falcons. The griffons are taught to respond to goliath whistles and never stray too far from their masters.
>
>A goliath character who earns Rahi's respect can be taught the secrets of griffon taming over a period of 1 year, during which time the character is entrusted to watch over and protect a single griffon egg and, when it hatches, the emergent griffon youngling. At the end of the year, if the griffon is still alive, the character must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, with advantage if the character accepts Rahi's guidance. If the check fails, the character is unable to tame the griffon. If the check succeeds, the character tames the griffon and bonds with it for life. Control of the griffon can be given to the goliath's player at this time.
>
>Modify the **griffon** stat block as follows to account for the young griffon's development:
>
>- At birth, the **griffon** is Tiny and has 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points, a flying speed of 40 feet, and a Strength score of 2. It has a +0 bonus to hit on its attacks and deals 1 piercing damage with its beak and 1 slashing damage with its claws. Its challenge rating is 0 (10 XP).
>- After 1 year, the **griffon** is Small and has 13 (2d6 + 6) hit points and a Strength score of 8. It has a +1 bonus to hit on its attacks and deals 2 (1d4) piercing damage with its beak and 2 (1d4) slashing damage with its claws. Its challenge rating is 1/4 (50 XP).
>- After 2 years, the **griffon** is Medium and has 32 (5d6 + 15) hit points and a Strength score of 12. It has a +3 bonus to hit on its attacks and deals 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage with its beak and 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage with its claws. Its challenge rating is 1 (200 XP).
>- After 3 years, the **griffon** is fully grown and tame enough to be ridden as a mount.

#### S7. Shrine of Strength and Honor

>>In the center of this twelve-foot-high cave stands an eight-foot-tall stone inscribed with runes. Behind it, a five-foot-diameter chute with carved footholds ascends to another cavern.
>>

The chute leads to area S9. If goliaths are in that area, characters can hear loud cheers coming from there.

***Runestone.*** The runestone is one of two sacred stones in Skytower Shelter (the other is in area S5). The goliaths pray next to it when they seek to gain physical strength and victory in combat and competition. The scripture on the runestone is written in Dwarvish and is concerned with the glory and honor found in battle and in competition. This honor is not always granted, however, because glory comes only to those who challenge themselves through physical trials. (There is no glory for a goliath who is unchallenged in battle, athletics, and competition, just as there is no glory for the griffon that slays a mouse.)

A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the runestone. Any humanoid creature that prays or meditates next to the runestone for at least 1 hour gains a runestone die, a d6. Once within the next 24 hours, it can roll the die and add the number rolled to one Strength check or weapon attack roll it makes. It can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the runestone die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the runestone die is rolled, it is lost, and the humanoid can't gain another from this runestone for 10 days.

#### S8. Passage of Carvings

>>This rough-hewn passageway slopes gently upward to the south. Ensconced torches illuminate carvings on the walls.
>>

The carvings depict the history of the Akannathi clan. This saga begins at the north end of the passage and unfolds as one travels south toward area S9. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can determine that the oldest carvings are roughly 400 years old and the newest ones are quite recent.

The earliest carvings tell the story of how the Akannathi goliaths tamed the mountainÃ¢ÂÂhow they dug tunnels and caves to serve their needs, creating a home for their people, and how they tamed the griffons of the mountain, turning these ravenous monsters into stalwart hunting companions. Later carvings focus on wars against the orcs, when the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths were united against a common foe. Carvings made within the past century chronicle the souring of the friendship between the two goliath clans, with scenes showing warriors of Wyrmdoom Crag slaying griffons followed by bloody skirmishes between the goliath clans on mountainsides. The newest carvings depict lone goliaths chasing a giant polar bear (a representation of Oyaminartok, as described in *appendix C*) and a diminished population of Skytower goliaths contending with the seemingly endless winter.

#### S9. Feasting Cave

Nine **goliath warriors** occupy this area when the characters arrive at Skytower Shelter. If they were drawn to area S2 by a disturbance, adjust the following boxed text to account for their absence:

>>A long, rectangular firepit heats this fifteen-foot-high cave and fills the area with the scent of meat cooking on a grate over the pit. The sound of cheering also fills the cave as two goliaths stand near the southern wall with their arms extended out from their sides, holding a large rock in each hand. Their arm muscles are quivering from exertion, and their jaws are clenched. Seven more goliaths stand around them, cheering and waving haunches of cooked meat.
>>

When the goliaths become aware of the characters, add:

>>When the goliaths spot you, they stop cheering. The competition ends as the two goliaths let their rocks tumble to the floor, and all nine goliaths glare at you.
>>

Two goliaths were competing in a test of strength to see who could hold their arms up the longest under the weight of the rocks. Unless the characters are accompanied by a member of the Akannathi clan, the goliaths try to frighten away the interlopers, attacking them if they refuse to leave. A clever character can win over the goliaths by challenging and beating one or more of them in a rock-holding contest. The contest plays out as follows:

- Each participant is given a pair of heavy rocks and must hold one in each hand while keeping their arms parallel to the floor.
- At the end of each minute, each participant must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check to keep their arms raised. The DC starts at 5 and increases by 5 at the end of each minute thereafter. On a failed check, the participant drops their arms and is out of the game. If the last two participants fail at the same time, the contest ends in a tie.

Any character who wins a rock-holding contest earns the respect of the goliaths in this cave. That respect can grow into friendship, provided the characters have done nothing that would turn the goliaths against them.

#### S10. Communal Cave

>>Blankets and bedrolls made from hides lie in a rough circle around a smoldering fire. In an alcove to the north, three young goliaths are playing amid a pile of coins and gemstones.
>>

The three young goliaths are noncombatants who stand 4 to 5 feet tall.

***Treasure.*** The Akannathi clan stockpiles treasure in the northern end of this chamber. The goliaths have little use for valuables, except for clan members who want to visit Ten-Towns or other more distant settlements and need some form of currency to secure food or lodging. The treasure pile includes the following:

- 420 gp, 1,664 sp, and 2,260 cp in mixed coinage
- Thirteen gemstones: eight eye agates (10 gp each), five moonstones (50 gp each), and an amethyst (100 gp)
- A carved bone statuette of Gruumsh, the one-eyed orc god of slaughter (25 gp)
- A gold birdcage with electrum filigree (250 gp)
- A *potion of gaseous form* in a gray crystal vial

### Ending the Goliath Feud

The chieftains of the Akannathi and Thuunlakalaga clans will never come to terms on their own. Characters who want to end the feud between the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag must convince the chieftains, Arn and Ogolai, to meet on neutral ground, away from their respective lairs, since neither chieftain wants to appear weak in the eyes of the other.

#### Summit of the Chiefs

Arn will agree to meet Ogolai on neutral ground, but only if Kaniaka (see area S4) urges him to do so. Ogolai will agree to meet Arn on neutral ground, but only if the characters heal the wounded aarakocra at Wyrmdoom Crag (see area W6). Both chieftains intend to bring an entourage of goliath warriors with them to the meeting, and it takes some additional diplomacyÃ¢ÂÂand perhaps a Charisma (Persuasion) check or twoÃ¢ÂÂto convince them to keep their delegations small.

#### Negotiations

Characters who bring Arn and Ogolai together still have their work cut out for them; neither chieftain is ready to forgive and forget the events that created the division between them. If one or more characters don't mediate the conversation, the meeting ends with each chieftain walking away in disgust at the other's unwillingness to accept blame. Allow the players time to devise a strategy for ending the impasse. Three possible solutions are presented below:

- The characters urge the chieftains, for the good of Icewind Dale, to unite against a common foe (such as Auril the Frostmaiden, Arveiaturace the White Wyrm, or **Xardorok Sunblight**). Goliath warriors from both clans, working as allies, might learn to forget the past and forge a brighter future for all goliaths.
- A character who has earned the respect of one or both clans convinces either chieftain that being the first to accept responsibility for a misunderstanding, even when others should share the blame, is a sign of moral strength and good character. Once one chieftain accepts blame, it's easier for the other to do the same.
- The characters keep the chieftains talkingÃ¢ÂÂfor days, if that's what it takesÃ¢ÂÂby turning it into a contest of endurance. The two chieftains waste hours airing their grievances, then spend longer hours glaring at each other in stubborn silence. (The characters' patience is eventually rewarded when Ogolai has food and tea brought to her. She offers to share her repast with Arn, who begrudgingly accepts out of politeness. This moment marks a turning point as the chieftains agree that there can be no winner to this contest and, more important, that the contest is a metaphor for their pointless, long-standing feud.)

## Wyrmdoom Crag

Wyrmdoom Crag is one of two goliath settlements described in this chapter, the other being Skytower Shelter (see "Skytower Shelter"). Read both entries before running encounters in either location. Also review the "Goliaths" entry in *appendix C*, in particular the "Spine of the World Goliaths" section. There is also a list of goliath names you can draw from, as needed.

Wyrmdoom Crag is home to the friendly Thuunlakalaga goliath clan. Shortly after establishing this lair for themselves, the goliaths were challenged by an adult white dragon. The dragon underestimated the goliaths' determination, and decades later, its skeletal remains still lie nearby as a testament to their triumph.

There are three reasons why the characters might visit Wyrmdoom Crag:

- They're drawn to the location by a tall tale (see "Tall Tales in Ten-Towns") or by a quest to help Dannika Graysteel acquire some white dragon bones (see "Dragon Bone Stew").
- One of the characters is a goliath from Wyrmdoom Crag who wants to return home.
- The characters seek to end the feud between the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag. (The characters will need to visit both locations to succeed in their mission.)

The Wyrmdoom goliaths are willing to share their dwelling with travelers and guests, but they hold a strong dislike for the goliaths of Skytower Shelter. The characters can learn the cause of that resentment by speaking to Ogolai, chieftain of the Thuunlakalaga clan.

### Into the Mountains

To get to either of the goliath outposts or to move between them, the characters need to negotiate the Spine of the World, where travel is the most difficult of any region in Icewind Dale. Use the rules in the "Mountain Travel" section to simulate the perils of getting around in the peaks.

### Wyrmdoom Crag Overview

Wyrmdoom Crag faces north from atop a snowy mountain slope. The bones of an adult white dragon rest near the entrance to the lair.

The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag enjoy company and will trade food and shelter for stories and news from Icewind Dale. The goliaths are rich in stories of their own and are not shy about sharing their history.

Although these goliaths are friendly and welcoming, they bear a bitter grudge against the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and will treat any character hailing from that clan accordingly. Additionally, these goliaths have a strong distaste toward visitors who seek to stir up trouble beyond simple competitiveness. If such a situation occurs, they expel the offending visitor.

![Map 2.14: Wyrmdoom Crag](img/adventure/IDRotF/144-map-2.14-wyrmdoom-crag.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/145-map-2.14-wyrmdoom-crag-player.webp)
### Wyrmdoom Crag Locations

Wyrmdoom Crag is a cave complex carved into the north face of a 15,000-foot-high mountain. Tunnels are 10 feet high throughout, and the caves are lit by torches.

The following locations are keyed to map 2.14.

#### W1. Approach

>>Fresh tracks in the snow make it relatively easy to find the goliath settlement of Wyrmdoom Crag on the northern slope of a soaring mountain. Following these tracks leads you to a cave, outside which the bones of a dragon lie half-buried in the snow. Past these remains, torchlight flickers in a pair of tunnels that burrow into the mountain leading west and south.
>>
>>East of the dragon's bones, rough-hewn steps climb to a twenty-foot-high, open-air arena with stone bleachers carved into the eastern wall. Rising from the arena floor are more than a dozen pillars of rock, each five to eight feet tall and about a foot in diameter.
>>

The tracks in the snow were made by two goliath warriors returning from a hunt. See area W2 for more about the stone platform and the bleachers.

The bones are those of an adult white dragon named Stygiarus, which met its doom at the hands of the goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag. Four **chwingas** (see *appendix C*) lurk amid the bones and make their presence known by popping out as the characters approach. The chwingas follow the characters around for as long as the party remains in the vicinity of Wyrmdoom Crag. The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag are aware of the chwingas and usually ignore them.

Each **chwinga** has a fascination for something and is irresistibly drawn to any character who has or demonstrates that certain something. If a character indulges a **chwinga**'s fascination once a day for three consecutive days, the **chwinga** rewards that character with a supernatural gift before it departs (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). See the "New Chwinga Charms" section in appendix C for more charms. Each **chwinga**'s fascination is described below:

**Chwinga 1** has a white face with a dark triangle painted over one eye. It is fascinated by Small characters and tries to ride around on them.

**Chwinga 2** has a white face with two concentric blue rings around one eye. It is fascinated by beards and likes to comb them with a pinecone.

**Chwinga 3** has curly black antennae growing out of its head. It is fascinated by whistling and by its own reflection. It capers enthusiastically whenever a character makes whistling noises or puts a mirror in front of it.

**Chwinga 4** wears a gown made of pine needles. It is fascinated by characters who chew with their mouths open and tries to look down their throats while they eat.

![Goat-ball is the favorite sport and pasttime of the Wyrmdoom Crag goliaths](img/adventure/IDRotF/146-02-025.goat-ball.webp)

#### W2. Goat-Ball Court

>>Fifteen crude stone pillars stand on this raised arena. The bleachers carved into the back wall are sheathed in ice, and at the top of the seating section are burnt torch stubs in sconces and a narrow tunnel.
>>

The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag gather here at least once a day to watch children or adults enjoying a game of goat-ball (see the "Goat-Ball" sidebar). If the characters endear themselves to the goliaths, four **goliath warriors** from area W7 challenge them to a friendly goat-ball match. Characters who turn down the challenge are free to watch a game instead. The goliaths don't mind a little betting on the side.

The narrow tunnel above and behind the bleachers leads down to area W6.

> ##### Goat-Ball
>
>Goat-ball is a team sport similar to dodgeball. It uses a furry, misshapen ball made of stuffed goat hide and also requires a dozen or more elevated platforms (usually pillars or tree stumps) arranged in a random pattern. Two teams of four players clamber onto the platforms, pass the ball back and forth, and try to knock their opponents off their platforms. A team wins if all its opponents have been knocked out of the game.
>
>***Rules.*** To determine the outcome of a goat-ball game, have each player in the game make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice). Add up the totals for each team. The team with the highest total wins. In the event of a tie, the game goes into overtime and all the players re-roll.

#### W3. Weaponsmith

>>The sound of metal hissing as it cools echoes through this warm, ten-foot-high chamber as a female goliath submerges a glowing javelin head into a barrel of water. The anvil in the center of the cave is illuminated by the light of a burning forge against the west wall. Against the wall nearby are several tools and weapons.
>>

The weaponsmith of Wyrmdoom Crag is a **goliath warrior** named Wayani Highhunter Thuunlakalaga. Her forging techniques emulate those of a dwarf smith from whom she learned her craft. She owns a complete set of smith's tools, with which she is proficient, and is happy to talk about her work. If the characters seem friendly, she offers to take them to see Ogolai, the clan chieftain, in area W5.

Among the items found in this forge are thirteen metal *javelins* and three hefty *greataxes*, all nonmagical.

#### W4. The Crawl

>>The floor of this fifteen-foot-high cavern bulges in the middle, with a five-foot-diameter hole on either end of the upraised part, marking the ends of a tunnel. The exterior of the bulge has runes inscribed on every surface of it.
>>
>>At the back of the cave, an elderly male goliath sits with three adolescent goliaths around a campfire. The elderly goliath is dyeing scraps of cloth and leather in a bucket of greenish liquid and setting them to dry on a wooden rack while the adolescents stitch other scraps into garments for dolls they are fashioning. Scores of old dolls rest in niches along the cave walls, staring outward.
>>

The elderly goliath is a noncombatant named Demelok Nightwalker Thuunlakalaga, and he's helping the goliath youths make ceremonial dolls. The three youths are unarmed and unarmored **goliath warriors** named Jaagrik, Kaga, and Zuri.

***Rune-Carved Tunnel.*** If the characters ask about the rune-carved tunnel that burrows under the floor, Demelok tells them that it serves two purposes: to test young goliaths on the cusp of adulthood and to impart the wisdom that comes from knowing one's own character.

After learning the lessons needed to become full-fledged adults, a young goliath offers up a symbol of their childhoodÃ¢ÂÂa dollÃ¢ÂÂand crawls through the tunnel. Members of their family wait for them on the other side, ready to welcome them into adulthood. The visions seen by those who crawl through the tunnel force them to face their fears, experience what it means to be truly alone, and recognize their own weaknesses. Not everyone has the fortitude to make it through the tunnel on the first attempt, but those who fail can try again.

Visitors who want to experience this trial are warned that it is not for the faint of heart. A character who reaches the tunnel's midpoint must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw and a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save fails, the character is unable to move forward and must withdraw the way they came. If both saves fail, the character is so overwhelmed by visions of terror that they fall into a coma, becoming unconscious for 4d6 hours. A character who succeeds on both saving throws can crawl through the tunnel and out the other side, having confronted the visions and overcome them.

Any character who gets Chief Ogolai's consent to crawl through the tunnel is considered an honorary member of the Thuunlakalaga clan if they pass the trial.

#### W5. Main Hall

>>This cavern has a domed roof thirty feet high and an open well in the middle of the floor. Two youthful goliaths use ropes and a bucket to draw water from the well while six adults wrangle a handful of exuberant goliath toddlers.
>>
>>Rough-hewn stairs ascend to the southern part of the cave, where the floor is ten feet higher. Seated in this area next to a crackling fire is a female goliath with gray hair, many scars, and a white cloak made of mountain goat hide. Leaning against the wall behind her is a greataxe with a bone haft. She gnaws on a pipe as she tries to settle a dispute between two goliath children.
>>

This cave is where most members of the Thuunlakalaga clan sleep and socialize. Bedrolls of goatskins and furs are set out on the floor in a loose semicircle around a well in the center of the room.

When the characters arrive, the cave contains eight **goliath warriors**, including six adults and two unarmed and unarmored goliath youths. There are also six goliath children (noncombatants), including the two speaking with the clan's chieftain, a **goliath warrior** named Ogolai Orcsplitter Thuunlakalaga, who is endearingly called "Old Goat" by other clan members. Her greataxe has a haft made from white dragon bone, and her white cloak is magical (see "*Treasure*" below). If a fight erupts here, nine more **goliath warriors** arrive from area W7 to help put an end to it.

Ogolai greets new arrivals and invites them to join her by the fire. If she takes a shine to them, she walks them back to the feasting cave (area W7) for a hot meal. If she is asked why the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths don't get along, Ogolai says:

>>"Many summers ago, the children of Wyrmdoom challenged the children of Skytower to a game of goat-ball. During the game, the ball tumbled near one of the griffons of Skytower. When one of our children tried to fetch the ball, the griffon went berserk and grievously wounded her. The game was called off. Hungry for more of the child's flesh, the griffon haunted Wyrmdoom for days. Our hunters were forced to kill it to protect the child. The two clans have been opposed ever since."
>>

Although she doesn't say so, Ogolai is the child who was wounded by the griffon, as the scars on her face suggest. To this day, she fears griffons and blames the Skytower goliaths for not keeping theirs under control.

If the characters claim to be neutral arbiters seeking to end the conflict between the clans, Ogolai says she's prepared to meet with Arn Akannathi, the leader of the Skytower goliaths, but refuses to meet him at Skytower Shelter. Ogolai insists that the meeting occur on the goat-ball court at Wyrmdoom Crag, which she knows Arn will never agree to. Ogolai's refusal to conduct negotiations at Skytower Shelter stems from her deep-seeded fear of griffons, though she would never admit to this fact lest she appear weak. Ogolai is not interested in offering any goodwill gesture to Arn, whom she bluntly calls a "walking stillborn."

***Missing Goliath.*** If the characters establish a rapport with Ogolai, she tells them that one of her clan's warriors, a young male named Kapanuk, got separated from his hunting party during a blizzard a few days ago. Ogolai asks only that the characters keep an eye out for him as they travel through the mountains. (The characters might locate Kapanuk in area X28 of Xardorok's fortress in *chapter 3*.)

***Treasure.*** Ogolai's cloak has the magical properties of a *cloak of protection*.

***Well.*** The main source of clean water for the clan is the well. A fire bucket is lowered down on a rope to keep the water in the well from freezing.

#### W6. Private Caves

These 10-foot-high caves are the quarters of the chieftain and the best warriors of the clan. Ogolai claims the southernmost cave, where the tribe's valuables are kept (see "Treasure" below).

The northernmost cave contains a wounded **aarakocra** named Sikki-kree, who is being tended to by a **goliath warrior** named **Aruk Thundercaller Thuunlakalaga**, who has Insight +4 and Medicine +4. Sikki-kree crashed in the mountains when she was caught in a blizzard and was rescued by goliath hunters. Aruk has been nursing the aarakocra back to health, but he can do only so much. Although Sikki-kree's minor wounds have healed, she has a broken wing that requires at least 10 hit points of magical healing to be mended. The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag have no such magic at their disposal. Any character who helps Sikki-kree regain her ability to fly earns the aarakocra's gratitude and the respect of the Wyrmdoom goliaths.

Once Sikki-kree can fly again, she thanks the characters for their help before getting Ogolai's permission to depart. Ogolai is indebted to the characters for helping the aarakocra, enough that she will agree to a meeting with the chieftain of the Skytower goliaths if the characters request one.

***Treasure.*** Ogolai's cave contains a pile of treasure that her clan has amassed. The Wyrmdoom goliaths have little use for valuables but keep this stockpile for clan members who visit Ten-Towns or other settlements and need some form of currency to secure food or lodging. The stockpile includes the following:

- 350 gp, 1,177 sp, and 1,850 cp in mixed coinage
- Sixteen gemstones: nine banded agates (10 gp each), four carnelians (50 gp each), two spinels (100 gp each), and a topaz (500 gp)
- A gold chain pendant (25 gp) inset with a *yellow diamond elemental gem* (the goliaths are unaware of its magical nature)

#### W7. Feasting Cave

>>Three adult goliaths are cooking meat over a rectangular firepit in the middle of this fifteen-foot-high cave while a goliath youth distributes ceramic bowls of food to other goliaths sitting around the room on woolly rugs and furs.
>>
>>An elderly male taps a rhythmic beat on a large goatskin drum held between his knees. While he plays, a couple of goliaths wrestle on the floor in front of him. Those seated near them occasionally move out of the way when the wrestlers roll too close to them.
>>

Unless the warriors have been drawn elsewhere, this cave nine **goliath warriors** plus eight goliath noncombatants (children and clan elders).

The Wyrmdoom goliaths are overjoyed if one or more characters express an interest in wrestling. Although the goliaths don't customarily take on smaller or weaker opponents, they never refuse a challenge. Winning a wrestling match requires a competitor to succeed on two consecutive contested Strength (Athletics) checks.

# Chapter 3: Sunblight

Adventurers race against time to stop **Xardorok Sunblight** from unleashing terror upon Ten-Towns.

Sequestered among the crags of the Spine of the World is a grim fortress hewn out of rock. This fortress is home to **Xardorok Sunblight**, his two living sons, and the rest of the Sunblight duergar clan. It is a heavily defended gateway between the clan's former home in the Underdark and its future home in Icewind Dale. From here, Xardorok plots the destruction of Ten-Towns.

Xardorok has no imagination of his own. Instead, he receives inspiration from his patron, whom he believes is Deep Duerra (the duergar god of conquest). Unknown to Xardorok, his warlock powers come from Asmodeus, the Lord of the Nine Hells, who enjoys impersonating other gods. It is Asmodeus, not Deep Duerra, who inspired **Xardorok Sunblight** to become the first duergar to leave the Underdark and carve out a kingdom for himself on the surface.

![Adventurers race against time to stop {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF} from unleashing terror upon Ten-Towns](img/adventure/IDRotF/147-03-000.chapter-splash.webp)

## Running This Chapter

Characters who learn of Xardorok's plot to forge a dragon of chardalyn and unleash it upon Ten-Towns might decide to launch a preemptive strike on Xardorok's fortress. This chapter describes the fortress of Sunblight in detail, in the event the adventurers decide to attack it. But the characters are in for a surprise: by the time they arrive, Xardorok has already finished his construct and set it loose, leaving the characters with an agonizing decision: press the attack against the duergar fortress, or intercept the dragon in Ten-Towns. If they choose the latter course, skip over this chapter for now and proceed with *chapter 4*.

The characters are more likely to survive an invasion of Xardorok's fortress if they are at least 4th level. Characters of lower level can succeed if they take frequent rests or have an edge, such as plenty of healing magic or allies to back them up.

### Speaker's Quest

If the characters lack incentive to confront Xardorok in his fortress, either because they didn't encounter his sons in *chapter 1* or because the duergar threat hasn't impacted them yet, you can have one of the speakers in Ten-Towns invite them to a private meeting. The speaker would know the characters by reputation, if nothing else. At this meeting, the speaker presents the following information:

>>"Invisible enemies walk among us. We have seen their boot prints in the snow, and now we know what they are: duergar. These malevolent dwarves of the Underdark have infiltrated Ten-Towns in search of a rare crystal known as chardalyn. With it, they're building a mighty construct that will lay waste to Ten-Towns if nothing is done to stop it.
>>
>>"Our militia captured one of the duergar and forced it to divulge the location of their mountain stronghold. Therein you will find a duergar warlord named **Xardorok Sunblight**. He aims to conquer Icewind Dale and destroy us all. For the good of Ten-Towns, will you penetrate the duergar fortress, slay this evil warlord, and destroy his terrible weapon?"
>>

If the characters accept this quest, the speaker provides them with a map of Icewind Dale that marks the location of the duergar fortress, as shown on map 2.1 (see "*Map 2.1 Icewind Dale*"). For the benefit of your players, you can point to the fortress's location using the poster map of Icewind Dale.

If the characters ask to speak with the captured duergar, the speaker informs them that the duergar was put to death following the interrogation, to keep him escaping and warning his kin. If the characters insist on seeing the duergar, the speaker takes them to a cellar where the body is being kept. Any character who casts a *speak with dead* spell on the dead duergar can validate the information that the speaker has already imparted.

The speaker has little to offer the characters as recompense beyond hospitality and friendship. If the characters insist on a more tangible reward, the speaker scowls, apologizes for misjudging them, and lets them go about their business. Their reputation takes a blow if they decline to help. Regardless of the meeting's outcome, the speaker's next task is to prepare the settlement for what will surely be the fight of its life, in the event that Xardorok's construct attacks Ten-Towns.

### Trouble in the Fortress

The following sections describe what the characters are up against in this chapter.

#### Xardorok's Paranoia

Xardorok's obsession with chardalyn is a form of madness that has consumed the duergar warlock, to the extent that he will stop at nothing to obtain all of it. Xardorok prizes chardalyn more than he loves his sons and his clan, which has alienated his closest advisors and forced them to question their blind obedience to him.

Prolonged contact with malevolent magic suffusing the chardalyn has made Xardorok extraordinarily paranoid. He keeps his two sons, Durth and Nildar, as far away from him as possible, sending them on dangerous missions to acquire more chardalyn in and around Ten-Towns, fearing that they might usurp his throne otherwise. Xardorok rewards his subjects for spying on one another and uncovering plots against him. The duergar closest to him are aware of the changes in his demeanor, but they lack the courage to stand up to him. A few have learned to capitalize on his paranoia, gaining Xardorok's favor by fabricating evidence of coups orchestrated by their rivals.

#### The Muzgardt Conspiracy

**Grandolpha Muzgardt**, the grand dame of the Muzgardt duergar clan, has recently arrived at the fortress after being invited here by Xardorok. The Muzgardts are based in Gracklstugh, a duergar city in the Underdark. They mass-produce and distribute a filthy duergar ale made from mushrooms. Xardorok has been eager to take a fourth wife and has had his eye on **Grandolpha Muzgardt** for many years. He asked Grandolpha to his fortress to give her a giftÃ¢ÂÂa pseudodragon made of chardalyn (a pseudo-pseudodragon, if you will)Ã¢ÂÂand make her an offer she can't refuse. Once he conquers Icewind Dale, he wants the Muzgardts to control the ale trade throughout his sunless surface kingdom.

Grandolpha, for her part, is too canny and jaded to fall for Xardorok's blunt attempt at seduction. She has begun plotting with disenfranchised advisors and warriors in his ranks to overthrow him when the moment is right. Ironically, despite his paranoia, Xardorok is too blinded by his admiration for Grandolpha to foresee her treachery. In Grandolpha, the characters might find an unlikely (if temporary) ally.

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, characters can advance to 6th level and no farther. Level advancement is handled as follows:

- The characters gain a level if they defeat **Xardorok Sunblight**.
- The characters gain a level if they accomplish any two of the following feats: find the chardalyn dragon's flight plan in area X4, free the myconid sovereign in area X19, or destroy the heart of the red dragon in area X24.

## Finding the Fortress

The characters can find a map aboard the Easthaven ferry that shows the location of Xardorok's fortress. They obtain a similar map if they accept the speaker's quest presented earlier in this chapter. If the characters fail to obtain the map, they can use magic to compel a captured duergar to divulge the location of the fortress.

### Approaching the Fortress

To get to Xardorok's fortress, the characters need to negotiate the Spine of the World. Use the rules in the "Mountain Travel" section to simulate the perils of getting around in the peaks.

>>Beyond the snowy foothills, low-lying clouds obscure the icy peaks of the gargantuan mountains that form the Spine of the World. Eventually, you get above the clouds and behold a sheer mountain wall rising more than a hundred feet before you. Carved high on the wall are rows of arrow slits with lights burning behind them and clanking sounds issuing from them. A narrow staircase hewn from the rock leads up along one side of the wall.
>>

The steps leading up to it are barely 5 feet wide and climb 150 feet to a frost-covered shelf that adjoins the main entrance (area X1).

#### Difficult Decision

As the characters begin their ascent, read:

>>From high above comes a loud grinding noise as large sheets of ice break off the fortress walls and tumble down the mountainside. Suddenly, great doors of ice previously hidden under snow stand open more than three hundred feet above you, and from between them flies a huge dragon made of dark ice. Its eyes glow with a bright golden light as it lets out a terrible roar, hurls itself into the air, and glides away from the fortress, then turns and heads north toward Ten-Towns.
>>

The **chardalyn dragon** (see *appendix C*) exits the fortress by climbing up a shaft that leads from the forge level to the fortress's summit. The doors at the top of the shaft remain open until the dragon returns or until someone closes them by using the levers in areas X13 and X15.

The dragon stays at least 250 feet away from the party and does not pay any attention to the characters as it flies off on its mission to destroy Ten-Towns. Given the dragon's impressive flying speed, it's unlikely that the characters will be able to catch up to it.

The characters must now make a big decision: do they assault Xardorok's fortress as planned or follow the dragon back to Ten-Towns? If they continue their climb to the fortress, continue with the next section; if they pursue the dragon, move on to *chapter 4*.

## Xardorok's Fortress

The fortress, depicted on map 3.1, has the following noteworthy features:

- **Bare Stone.** Hewn from gray stone, the fortress is bereft of ornamentation or artistic flair. Doors are likewise made of bare stone, with iron handles and hinges.

***Smoky Haze.*** Smoke from the forge (area X24) permeates the interior of the fortress. Unless the text notes otherwise, all areas are lightly obscured by this smoky haze. Exposure to it is unhealthy; characters who take a long rest in a hazy location regain one fewer Hit Die than normal. A strong wind that lasts 1 minute or longer clears an area of smoky haze for 1 hour thereafter.

***Heat.*** Duergar have darkvision and don't need light to see; even so, most rooms are heated by stone braziers filled with glowing-hot coals, and such areas are dimly lit.

- **Ceilings.** Tunnel ceilings are 10 feet high and flat. Room ceilings are 15 feet high and vaulted in most areas except for the larger spaces on the forge level, which are 30 feet high.

***Elevators.*** The three levels of the fortress are connected by two mechanical elevators that are continually moving up and down their shafts, except for a 1-minute stop each time it arrives at a floor. One elevator links areas X6, X13, and X22, and the other links areas X12, X15, and X30. An elevator can be disabled in any location where its wheel mechanisms are exposed (as shown on map 3.1).

### Where Is Xardorok?

To determine Xardorok's whereabouts when the characters arrive at the fortress, roll a d20 and consult the Xardorok's Location table or simply choose one of the suggested locations.

##### Xardorok's Location
|  d20  | Location                                           |
|:-----:|----------------------------------------------------|
|  1Ã¢ÂÂ5  | Resting on his throne in area X19                  |
|  6Ã¢ÂÂ10 | Barking orders in area X24                         |
| 11Ã¢ÂÂ15 | Praying before the statue in area X29              |
| 16Ã¢ÂÂ20 | Torturing a duergar accused of treason in area X34 |

![Map 3.1: Sunblight (Xardorok's Fortress)](img/adventure/IDRotF/148-map-3.1-sunblight.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/149-map-3.1-sunblight-player.webp)
### Command Level

The command level contains living quarters for Xardorok and his two sons, as well as halls for training and dining.

#### X1. Entrance

>>Moving east from the top of the stairs leads you to the entrance of the fortress: a ten-foot-high double door of featureless stone. An arrow slit facing in your direction guards the approach.
>>

The entrance doors are barred shut from within and can't be opened from the outside, except with the use of a *knock* spell or similar magic. Pushing a lever in area X6 retracts the stone bars and causes the doors to swing inward on squealing iron hinges.

Beyond the double door is a lowered iron portcullis. Area X6 contains the winch that raises and lowers the portcullis, which can also be forced open with a *knock* spell or similar magic.

***Arrow Slit.*** A **duergar** guard in area X6 watches the icy ledge through the arrow slit, which grants him three-quarters cover against attacks made from outside the fortress. If he sees the characters approaching on the ledge, the duergar turns invisible and watches them without announcing his presence. If the characters are having trouble getting through the double door or the portcullis, the duergar opens them from area X6 without alerting the characters to his presence. This duergar is loyal to **Grandolpha Muzgardt** (see "The Muzgardt Conspiracy") and hopes the characters will dispose of Xardorok, or at least create a situation in which Xardorok can be killed by his fellow duergar.

#### X2. Vestibule

>>Beyond the portcullis is an empty room with a narrow opening at the far end and an arrow slit in the western wall.
>>

***Arrow Slit.*** A **duergar** guard in area X3 watches this room through the arrow slit, which grants her three-quarters cover. If she sees or hears intruders inside the fortress, she shouts, "To arms!" in Undercommon. The nine **duergar** guards in area X3 spend 1 round rallying before pouring out of the barracks to confront the foes.

#### X3. Upper Barracks

>>A low stone table flanked by stone benches dominates this room, which is heated and illuminated by braziers of glowing-hot coals. Through the hazy smoke, you see featureless stone doors lining the walls.
>>

A female **duergar** guard stands in front of an arrow slit that peers into area X2. Additionally, eight **duergar** guards rest in the smaller rooms attached to this one. Each of these 10-foot-square rooms has three stone bunkbeds protruding from its walls.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the walls for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds such a door in the east wall. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a 5-foot-diameter tunnel that leads to a similar door blocking entry to area X4. No ability check is needed to find either secret door from inside the tunnel.

> ##### Duergar Names
>
>Here are some names you can use to identify duergar guards: Bruvo, Duerreth, Dwargyn, Fisketta, Gurn, Harmok, Jarjun, Jonkin, Kolbrak, Lurgash, Mrod, Mursk, Narla, Qualkin, Rovaalt, Skarda, Skorn, Throd, Ulkinn, Vygardt, Zorzula, and Zulkrod.
>

#### X4. Xardorok's War Room

>>This rectangular room has two sets of double doors, one to the north and the other to the south. A brazier of glowing-hot coals stands in each corner. In the middle of the room is a low stone table, on the top of which is drawn an illustration that looks something like a map.
>>

Closer inspection of the drawing reveals that it's an accurate depiction of Ten-Towns and its environs. Mounted to the top of a thin iron stand on the table is a 6-inch-tall dragon figurine carved out of chardalynÃ¢ÂÂa miniature version of Xardorok's chardalyn dragon, its wings outstretched. The figurine's stand is attached by an iron rod to a groove carved into the table, allowing the figurine to move across the map from one settlement to another. If a lever on the west side of the table is pulled, the dragon figurine "flies" over Ten-Towns on its preset course. Any character who pays close attention can discern the flight path of Xardorok's chardalyn dragon (see *chapter 4* for details).

***Dragon Figurine.*** The chardalyn figurine can be broken off its stand. As an art object, it is worth 50 gp. Anyone who keeps it on their person for more than 1 hour gains a random form of indefinite madness (see "Madness" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the walls for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds such a door behind the brazier in the southwest corner. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a 5-foot-diameter tunnel that leads to a similar door blocking entry to area X3. No ability check is needed to find either secret door from inside the tunnel.

#### X5. Xardorok's Quarters

>>Braziers heaped with glowing-hot coals heat this chamber, which contains a large stone bed covered with soot-stained furs, its head against the north wall. In a shallow niche above the bed is a bas relief of a giant, scowling duergar clenching its teeth. At the foot of the bed is a flat-topped iron trunk sealed with a bulky padlock. A stone door is set into the western wall.
>>

***Closet.*** The western door opens into a closet that Xardorok has converted into a shrine. A shelf embedded in the south wall holds a 2-foot-tall statuette of Deep Duerra made of chardalyn. It depicts a nude female duergar with no facial features and a spiked crown atop her bald head. Stacked on smaller shelves around the statuette are seven mind flayer skulls. A character can identify the depiction with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check. An indentation in the statuette's base holds the key that unlocks the iron trunk in Xardorok's bedchamber. The characters can find the key if someone lifts the statuette and looks underneath it.

Anyone other than Xardorok who touches the statuette of Deep Duerra must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Along with the psychic damage comes a terrible sensation of having one's brain devoured by an illithid. Once this effect has occurred, the statuette can be handled safely. Anyone who keeps the chardalyn statuette on their person for more than 1 hour gains a random form of indefinite madness (see "Madness" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Iron Trunk.*** The iron trunk is bolted to the floor. A character using thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the trunk.

The trunk contains Xardorok's personal possessions (see "Treasure" below), and it is trapped. If all its contents are removed, hidden springs raise the trunk's false bottom to rise slightly, at which point the stone visage above the bed opens its mouth and belches a cloud of poisonous gas large enough to fill the room. The gas hangs in the air for 10 minutes, then dissipates. Any creature that starts its turn in the cloud must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Treasure.*** The iron trunk contains a pair of dwarven sandals carved out of obsidian (250 gp), a quilted smoking jacket sized for a dwarf and sewn with fifty gemstones (500 gp), a malachite beard comb set with seven red garnets (750 gp), a hookah made of platinum and star sapphire (2,500 gp), and a rolled-up leather scroll with the following sequence of numbers written on it in Dwarvish:

|       |       |       |       |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 1-3-6 | 2-5-2 | 9-7-5 | 4-3-4 |
| 8-2-7 | 5-6-3 | 7-1-4 | 2-9-9 |

The numbers on the scroll are the combinations for the locked chests in the treasure vault (area X37).

#### X6. Guard Post

>>This room is heated and illuminated by braziers of glowing-hot coals. Visible on the west wall are an arrow slit, an iron lever, and a heavy iron winch.
>>
>>A floor-to-ceiling iron cage in the middle of the room contains an elevator shaft with chains running up and down away from it. The chains are in constant motion, and you hear loud mechanical noises higher up the shaft and farther down as well. A double door is embedded in the middle of the east wall. Air enters the room through a row of four arrow slits in the south wall.
>>

An invisible **duergar** named Dreck huddles in the southwest corner, trying to avoid detection. Despite his effort, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notices the duergar's cold breath. Dreck has secretly pledged his allegiance to **Grandolpha Muzgardt**, for he longs to be rid of **Xardorok Sunblight** and now sees the characters as instruments of Xardorok's demise. He fights only in self-defense.

***Elevator.*** A box-shaped iron elevator car constantly goes up and down the shaft, stopping for 1 minute on each floor and taking 1 minute to move from one level to the next. A collapsing iron gate on the west side of the cage slides open when the car arrives at this level from above or below. The 10-foot-wide stone shaft climbs 100 feet to area X13 and descends 100 feet to area X22.

***Lever.*** Moving the iron lever on the west wall opens and closes the fortress's outer doors (see area X1).

***Winch.*** Turning the iron winch on the west wall raises and lowers the portcullis between areas X1 and X2.

#### X7. Office of the Captain of the Guard

>>A stone desk and chair stand empty on the east side of the room. The braziers that normally heat and light the room have been extinguished. An arrow slit in the south wall lets in the frigid mountain air.
>>

Until recently, this room was the office of Xardorok's captain of the guard, who has been accused of plotting a coup and is being tortured in area X34.

#### X8. Private Dining Hall

>>Three braziers heaped with glowing-hot coals illuminate and heat this long hall. At the eastern end is a hexagonal stone table surrounded by six stone chairs. Seated in the chair facing the door is a haggard old duergar with long black hair streaked with ribbons of white and fingernails like shards of iron. She is devouring a hearty buffet of cooked meats, mushrooms, and strange Underdark fare. Lurking next to her is a small mechanical dragon made of a shiny black substance.
>>
>>Hunched over a hot stove in the west side of the room are three duergar cooks. At the sight of you, they drop their utensils and reach for their weapons, but the old duergar says something in Dwarvish that keeps them at bay.
>>

Xardorok and his sons dine here, occasionally joined by guests. In attendance today is Xardorok's paramour, **Grandolpha Muzgardt** (see the accompanying stat block). The three **duergar** cooks are Grandolpha's loyal bodyguards. The chardalyn dragonet next to Grandolpha is a gift from Xardorok; it's a lawful evil construct that understands Draconic and Dwarvish but can't speak. It otherwise has the statistics of a **pseudodragon**.

After telling her bodyguards to stand down, Grandolpha invites the characters to join her for dinner. The main course is a cooked intellect devourer, its brain-body stewing in its own juices. The characters can partake of the feast that Grandolpha's guards have prepared, but the food has a thin layer of ash covering it that spoils the taste. Grandolpha doesn't seem to mind, though. She also offers the characters a vile Muzgardt brew made from Underdark mushrooms, which she pours from a jug on the table before her.

Grandolpha has no stake in Xardorok's plot to conquer Icewind Dale and does nothing to help or hinder his efforts. If the characters threaten her, she laughs at their audacity and refuses to meet their demands. If the characters ask for her help, she shares the following information with them:

- She doesn't know Xardorok's current whereabouts but assumes he's in the forge (area X24) on the lowest level of the fortress.
- Xardorok has programmed his chardalyn dragon to follow a prearranged flight plan. The characters can view the dragon's route in Xardorok's war room (area X4).
- Xardorok is capturing Underdark monsters, which he plans to unleash upon Icewind Dale. He has also captured a myconid sovereign and is using its spores to reanimate corpses.
- Xardorok has proposed an alliance between his clan and the Muzgardt clan. Grandolpha is entertaining Xardorok's offer but hasn't agreed to anything. The mechanical pseudodragon was a gift from Xardorok, designed to win Grandolpha's affection.
- Given time, Grandolpha thinks she can turn most of the Sunblight duergar against Xardorok. Several of them have already pledged their loyalty to her.

Before entering combat, Grandolpha casts *stoneskin* on herself. Once her guards come to her rescue, she withdraws from combat and uses her *faerie fire* spell to make enemies easier for her guards to hit. The chardalyn pseudodragon defends Grandolpha to the death.

***Slaad Host.*** If a character has the Slaad Host secret (see *appendix B*) and has a **slaad tadpole** gestating inside them, having the tadpole burst out of the character's chest during dinner would be excellent timing for its shock value. Grandolpha suggests not killing the tadpole and instead proposes that it be allowed to grow into a full-sized slaad. "Let Xardorok deal with it," she says. If the characters allow this to happen, the tadpole slinks away and finds a quiet corner of the fortress in which to grow, becoming a full-grown slaad within 2d12 hours.

![{@creature Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF}](img/adventure/IDRotF/150-637357081668773609.webp)

#### X9. Portcullis

Across from the double doors to area X8 is a short hallway with a lowered iron portcullis at its southernmost end. Moving an iron lever jutting out of the west wall raises and lowers the portcullis, beyond which is a wide shaft that descends 100 feet to area X26 and climbs 120 feet to a pair of enormous doors carved out of ice.

The characters need magic or climbing gear to scale the shaft's rough-hewn walls.

#### X10. Durth's Quarters

>>This dark chamber contains a plain stone bed, a stone trunk, and four unlit braziers.
>>

This room belongs to Xardorok's eldest son and heir, Durth Sunblight. Durth is here only if he was forced to abandon his hideout in chapter 1 (see "Easthaven Ferry") or if he managed to steal a trove of chardalyn from the Easthaven town hall (see "The Chardalyn Caper"). Durth is a **duergar mind master** (see *appendix C*). If he hears suspicious activity outside his room, he shrinks to Tiny size and hides under the bed.

The trunk is Durth's longtime companion, an intelligent **mimic** that speaks Undercommon. It attacks anyone else who disturbs it. If he is present when the mimic attacks, Durth rolls initiative and joins the battle on the second round of combat.

#### X11. Nildar's Quarters

>>This dark room contains a plain stone bed, a stone trunk, and four unlit braziers. Mounted on the walls are the heads of various creatures that might be found in the mountains or the subterranean depths.
>>

This room belongs to Xardorok's youngest son, Nildar. If the characters forced him to abandon his post in chapter 1 (see "The Unseen"), Nildar is here, sulking in the dark and plotting his revenge. Nildar is a **duergar**. If his pet **ogre zombie** escaped with him, the rotting behemoth stands in the northeast corner of the room.

***Trophies.*** The mounted heads are those of a crag cat, a grick, a male drow, a kuo-toa, a troglodyte, a wolf, a peryton, and a female grimlock. Nildar didn't kill most of these creatures by himself, but he claimed the trophies.

***Trunk.*** Nildar's stone trunk holds a ceramic jug of wine, a drinking horn, and a rolled-up piece of leather bearing a charcoal sketch of his late mother's stern visage.

#### X12. Training Room

>>Braziers of glowing-hot coals stand in the corners of this room, working to offset the cold air that flows through a row of arrow slits on the south wall.
>>
>>Scattered around the room are several training dummies made of wood and sackcloth, as well as four freestanding suits of plate armor. A floor-to-ceiling iron cage in the middle of the room contains an elevator shaft with chains running up and down away from it. The chains are in constant motion, and you hear loud mechanical noises high above and below.
>>

The training dummies are harmless; they have been dismembered and sewn back together numerous times.

Touching one of the suits of armor or dealing damage to any of them causes all four to animate (use the **animated armor** stat block to represent them). They attack all other creatures in the room, which they can't leave of their own volition. If there are no other creatures in the room that they can attack on their turn, the suits of armor deactivate and revert to their inanimate state.

***Elevator.*** A box-shaped iron elevator car constantly goes up and down the shaft, stopping for 1 minute on each floor and taking 1 minute to move from one level to the next. A collapsing iron gate on the west side of the cage slides open when the car arrives at this level from above or below. The 10-foot-wide stone shaft climbs 100 feet to area X15 and descends 100 feet to area X30.

### Ice Gate Level

The uppermost level of the fortress contains the mechanism that operates the ice gateÃ¢ÂÂenormous doors through which Xardorok's chardalyn dragon comes and goes. These doors are carved out of thick ice and have hinged iron clamps holding them in place. When the doors are open, they allow access to a 30-foot-wide vertical shaft that descends 220 feet to area X26.

#### X13. Western Gear Room

The following boxed text assumes the characters enter this area by coming up the elevator. If they enter by the north tunnel, adjust the boxed text accordingly:

>>Ascending the elevator shaft deposits you in the middle of a large room with machinery filling the eastern half.
>>
>>A duergar stands in front of a double door in the north wall, and another is in the southeast corner next to a lever that juts out of the east wall. Braziers heaped with hot coals do little to offset the cold air that blows through the arrow slits in the south wall.
>>

The two **duergar** are hostile toward non-duergar. On their first turn in combat, the duergar grow to Large size; on subsequent turns, they attack intruders. Meanwhile, two **duergar hammerers** (see *appendix C*) lurk in the small chambers to the west. After all other creatures in the room have taken an action, roll initiative for the hammerers; on their first turn, the hammerers emerge from their rooms and join the fray on the side of the duergar.

***Elevator Shaft.*** The 10-foot-wide stone shaft descends 100 feet to area X6 and 200 feet to area X22.

***Ice Gate.*** The large stone wheel near the east wall is part of the mechanism that opens and closes the doors at the top of the fortress. Pulling the lever on the east wall causes the wheel to turn, opening the western half of the door; sliding the lever back to its original position closes it.

#### X14. Workshop

>>This messy workshop is heated and illuminated by braziers of glowing-hot coals in the corners. The room is furnished with stone tables and cabinets. In the middle of the room, surrounded by twisted bits of metal, is a half-finished exoskeletal construct like the ones you encountered in the room you came from.
>>

This room contains two **duergar** mechanics (one male, one female), both of whom turn invisible as soon as they hear sounds of combat in area X13. They try to remain hidden and fight only in self-defense.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the workshop find two sets of smith's tools and a set of tinker's tools.

#### X15. Eastern Gear Room

The following boxed text assumes the characters enter this area by coming up the elevator. If they enter by the north tunnel, adjust the boxed text accordingly:

>>Ascending the elevator shaft deposits you in the middle of a large room with machinery filling the western half.
>>
>>A duergar stands in the southwest corner next to a lever that juts out of the west wall. Braziers heaped with hot coals do little to offset the cold air blowing into the room through arrow slits in the south wall.
>>

The **duergar** guard grows to Large size before entering combat.

***Elevator Shaft.*** The 10-foot-wide stone shaft descends 100 feet to area X12 and 200 feet to area X30.

***Ice Gate.*** The large stone wheel near the west wall is part of the mechanism that opens and closes the doors at the top of the fortress. Pulling the lever on the west wall causes the wheel to turn, opening the eastern half of the door; sliding the lever back to its original position closes it.

### Forge Level (X16-X26)

The lowest level of the fortress contains, among many other features, Xardorok's forge, the iron mines, and a tunnel that connects to the Underdark. This level is also the warmest due to the heat generated in the forge.

#### X16. Northwest Cavern

>>This cavern is unlit and has a jagged, 30-foot-high ceiling.
>>
>>A strange sight confronts you as four duergar, two of them much larger than normal, use ropes to restrain a hulking biped with an insectoid body. A large sack has been pulled over the creature's bulbous head.
>>

A team of four **duergar** recently captured an **umber hulk** in the Underdark and brought it back here. If the characters challenge the duergar, the two enlarged ones remove the sack covering the umber hulk's head and release the creature, after which all four duergar turn invisible. The infuriated umber hulk sees the characters and attacks them. If the characters slay the umber hulk, the duergar attack them.

***To the Underdark.*** A 10-foot-wide, miles-long tunnel connects Xardorok's fortress to vast caverns and subterranean lakes under the Spine of the World. Exploration of the Underdark is beyond the scope of this adventure.

#### X17. Duergar Mines

>>Rich veins of iron ore run through the walls of this cavern. Narrow tunnels are cut deep into the rock. Here and there lie stacks of mining equipment.
>>

These mines provide the duergar with all the iron ore they need to fashion tools, weapons, exoskeletons for hammerers, and other items. They use the excavated stone for furniture and other structures. Currently, there are no duergar working in the mines.

Characters who explore the mines come across three **rust monsters** scrounging for iron ore. The rust monsters, which came up from the Underdark, attack anyone wearing metal armor or carrying metal shields or weapons.

#### X18. Guarded Corridor

Between two sets of double doors is a corridor with a dozen arrow slits along its walls. Four **duergar** guards are stationed in the hallways to either side (two per location). In addition to their normal weapons, these duergar carry heavy crossbows (+2 to hit) that deal 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit.

![A quaggoth convinces a myconid to yield more spores by tearing off its arm](img/adventure/IDRotF/151-03-001.quaggoth-myconid.webp)

#### X19. Chardalyn Throne

If **Xardorok Sunblight** (see *appendix C*) is encountered here, he's sitting on his throne. Describe him as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.

>>The ceiling of this hall arches to a height of thirty feet. Stone steps lead up to a semicircular dais against the south wall. Atop the dais is a misshapen throne crudely carved out of black crystal. Small, crackling flames burn in braziers that occupy the room's corners.
>>
>>Slumped near the east wall is a tall, bipedal fungus creature. Luminous spores float in the air around it. A savage, white-furred biped has torn off one of the creature's arms and is holding it while four other white-furred bipeds covered with fungal growths try to capture the floating spores in jugs.
>>

Xardorok's garrison includes several quaggoth thralls. A little over a tenday ago, a quaggoth thonot named Krob helped the duergar capture a **myconid sovereign** in the Underdark. The sovereign's name is Pleurota. With Xardorok's consent, Krob is harvesting Pleurota's animating spores and using them to turn dead quaggoths into spore servants. When the myconid sovereign became uncooperative, Krob tore off one of its arms.

Thonot Krob uses the **quaggoth** stat block with the modifications noted in the "*Variant: Quaggoth Thonot*" sidebar in the *Monster Manual*. He is joined in this room by four **quaggoth spore servants**. Krob and the spore servants fight to the death. If Krob dies, one of the spore servants uses its next action to pour its jug of spores over Krob's corpse, turning it into a new spore servant.

Sounds of combat here bring reinforcements from area X18 (four **duergar**) and area X20 (four **quaggoths**). All the duergar, including Xardorok if he's present, use Enlarge before joining the fight. If defeat seems likely, Xardorok retreats to area X22 and uses the elevator to make his way toward area X8, where he hopes to enlist the aid of **Grandolpha Muzgardt**, unaware of her true intentions. Grandolpha goes along with Xardorok but won't aid him in a fight, allowing the characters to kill him. If Xardorok is gravely wounded and Grandolpha can kill him without putting herself in harm's way, she seizes the opportunity.

***Throne.*** Prolonged contact with Xardorok's chardalyn throne can warp one's mind. A creature that remains in contact with the throne for 1 hour gains a random form of indefinite madness (see "Madness" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). If this madness isn't cured within 24 hours, it becomes permanent. Only a *wish* spell or divine intervention can end the permanent madness.

***Treasure.*** Each quaggoth spore servant has a jug containing enough of Pleurota's animating spores to turn one fresh corpse into a spore servant (as described in the "Myconids" entry in the *Monster Manual*).

#### X20. Quaggoth Den

>>This dark, filthy room is strewn with bones. It contains ten crude beds made of moss and clumps of fur. Loud mechanical noises come from behind the west wall.
>>

Unless they are drawn to area X19 by sounds of combat there, four **quaggoths** gnaw on bones in this room and attack intruders on sight. The quaggoths follow Thonot Krob who, in turn, obeys **Xardorok Sunblight**.

The noises heard coming from behind the west wall originate from the elevator located in area X22.

#### X21. Treacherous Guards

>>This room contains braziers of glowing-hot coals in the northwest corner and the southwest corner. Loud mechanical noises come from behind the double door in the middle of the east wall.
>>

Unless they were drawn to area X19 by sounds of combat there, two **duergar** stand against the west wall, watching the doors to area X22. These duergar have secretly pledged their loyalty to **Grandolpha Muzgardt** (see "The Muzgardt Conspiracy") and try to thwart Xardorok at every turn. They allow characters to pass through the room unmolested and are 50 percent likely to know Xardorok's current whereabouts.

#### X22. Western Elevator

>>The elevator shaft terminates in this room. A large stone wheel next to the iron cage turns constantly.
>>

***Elevator Shaft.*** The 10-foot-wide stone shaft ascends 100 feet to area X6 and 200 feet to area X13.

#### X23. Outer Gate

A 15-foot-high, 10-foot-wide iron gate is set into a 20-foot-high, 15-foot-wide wall that separates area X16 from area X24. The gate has a bulky padlock on its eastern side. The duergar forewoman (see area X25) carries the iron key to the padlock. A character with thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character must reach through the gate from area X16 to get at the lock. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the padlock.

Any attempt to breach the gate alerts the guards atop the watchtowers in the forge (areas X24Ã¢ÂÂX26).

![Enlarged to ogre size, {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF} defends his forge](img/adventure/IDRotF/152-03-002.xardorok.webp)

#### X24Ã¢ÂÂX26. Forge

>>Smoke fills this warm cavern, which has a ceiling that ranges from forty feet high down to twenty feet high along the south wall. The source of the smoke and heat is a ten-foot-tall stone forge shaped like a pyramid with its peak sheared off. Ripples of heat and flashes of firelight spew from the top of the forge, which emits a deep, pulsating heartbeat. A five-foot-deep trough extends east from the forge, with rows of black anvils on either side of the depression.
>>
>>Overlooking the forge are four twenty-foot-tall guard towers with gray-skinned dwarves standing behind their low battlements. Stone stairs provide access to the tops of the two towers nearest the forge.
>>
>>South of the forge is an enormous, five-foot-tall iron platform fitted with cranes and clamps, with short flights of iron stairs leading to the top of the platform. Surrounding it is a clean-up crew consisting of a female duergar with a horn and six hulking bipeds, their white fur stained with soot. They are tossing scraps into a cylindrical container. In the twenty-foot-high ceiling above this bin is a wide, rectangular hole.
>>

This encounter area is made up of several smaller locations within sight of one another. Area X24 is the forge itself. Area X25 is the iron platform where Xardorok's chardalyn dragon was assembled. Area X26 is the bottom of the shaft that the dragon uses to move up and out of the fortress. In addition, four guard towers ringed by 3-foot-high stone battlements look out over the area.

If **Xardorok Sunblight** (see *appendix C*) is here, he is standing atop the assembly platform (area X25), barking orders at the clean-up crew. Describe Xardorok as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.

The clean-up crew consists of the **duergar** forewoman, Thontara, and six **quaggoths**. Thontara carries a horn that she uses as a loudspeaker; the iron key that unlocks the outer gate (area X23) is hidden inside a compartment in the heel of her left boot.

Three guards are stationed atop each towerÃ¢ÂÂtwelve **duergar** in total. One guard on each tower is secretly loyal to **Grandolpha Muzgardt** (see "The Muzgardt Conspiracy"). If the characters engage in battle with Xardorok and appear to be winning, these duergar help by attacking the other duergar on their respective platforms; if Xardorok appears to be winning, these duergar stay out of the fight. The remaining duergar hurl javelins at foes from atop the towers, growing to Large size and switching to their war picks if forced into melee combat.

A fight here brings reinforcements from area X28: three **duergar hammerers** (see *appendix C*).

If defeat seems likely, Xardorok retreats and makes his final stand in Deep Duerra's temple (area X29).

***X24. Forge.*** Any creature that touches the forge for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in contact with the forge takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

Characters who get close enough to peer through the vents in the side of the forge can see that it contains a large, beating heart. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the heart belongs to a red dragon and is clearly kept alive by magic. The forge grants the heart three-quarters cover. The heart is a Large object with AC 13, 27 hit points, vulnerability to cold damage, and immunity to fire and psychic damage. The heart stops beating when reduced to 0 hit points, rendering the forge inoperable.

***X25. Assembly Platform.*** Underneath the platform is a 5-foot-high crawlspace.

***X26. Vertical Shaft.*** The shaft ascends 200 feet to the doors that make up the ice gate, which are open unless the characters closed them in area X13 and X15. The characters need magic or climbing gear to scale the shaft's rough-hewn walls. Below the shaft is a 5-foot-tall, 10-foot-diameter cylindrical bin. It contains dozens of fragments left over from the construction of the chardalyn dragon. Any chardalyn fragments stolen from the Easthaven town hall are here as well (see "The Chardalyn Caper").

### Forge Level (X27-X37)

#### X27. Giant Lizard Pens

>>This corridor is lined with six arched cells, each sealed off with a latched iron gate. Housed in each cell is a big lizard fitted with riding gear.
>>

The six **giant lizards** kept here are used by the duergar as mounts and pack animals. They are hostile toward non-duergar but can't attack through the closed gates. The gates are latched shut, but not locked.

#### X28. Dungeon

Unless they are drawn to the forge by sounds of combat there, three **duergar hammerers** (see *appendix C*) are spaced equidistantly along this corridor. Their job is to prevent prisoners from escaping, but they attack anyone outside the cells whom they don't recognize.

>>This dark corridor has narrow iron doors along the north wall and two similar doors at each end. An iron crossbar seals each door.
>>

If the duergar hammerers have been defeated or lured elsewhere, add:

>>Loud banging from one cell causes the bar on its door to tremble in its brackets. From another cell comes a gentle tapping sound.
>>

After its bar is removed, each iron door pulls open to reveal a cramped cell with no furnishings.

The tapping comes from the cell of a **doppelganger** that was caught trying to infiltrate the fortress. This creature takes the form of a scrawny human in a dirty loincloth named Pekoe Quint. "Pekoe" claims to be a trapper from Dougan's Hole and has the small, malformed ears and pointy teeth typical of that town's inbred stock. Pekoe says that the duergar abducted him and asked him a lot of questions about his town's defenses.

The doppelganger knows the settlements of Ten-Towns well enough to pass for a Ten-Towner. Any character who doubts Pekoe's story can make a Wisdom (Insight) check; if the character's check result is higher than the doppelganger's Charisma (Deception) check result, the character senses that something is off about Pekoe but can't tell what. The doppelganger tries to acquire some cold weather clothing and remains with the party until it reaches Ten-Towns. Once there, it slips away and adopts a new disguise. The doppelganger won't harm the characters unless they give it reason to.

The loud banging comes from an unarmed **goliath warrior** named Kapanuk Talltree Thuunlakalaga. After becoming separated from his hunting party during a blizzard, Kapanuk was ambushed by duergar and brought to the fortress for interrogation. Since he knows nothing about Ten-Towns, Kapanuk was of little use to his captors.

If released, Kapanuk tries to acquire some weapons and armor. He also invites the characters to return with him to Wyrmdoom Crag, where his kin will give them the heroes' feast they deserve. He shows no offense if the characters decline the invitation, but if they accept and are ready to leave, Kapanuk guides them through the mountains to his home (see "Wyrmdoom Crag").

You can add additional prisoners to the cellblock, at your discretion. The remaining cells are otherwise empty.

#### X29. Deep Duerra's Temple

When one or more characters enter the room with the statue, read:

>>Inside this room, you can hear loud mechanical noises that seem to come from behind the south wall.
>>
>>Standing in the middle of the room, facing the double door to the north, is a seven-foot-tall statue of a female duergar in a scale mail robe. The top of its head above the eyes has been sheared off, making a space for a stone brazier that gives off a flickering flame. Chained to the statue's pedestal is an emaciated, malformed creature with rubbery, purplish-gray flesh, a bulbous head with a metal plate bolted to it, and sinister eyes.
>>

If **Xardorok Sunblight** (see *appendix C*) is here, he is kneeling before the statue and calling on Deep Duerra (speaking in Dwarvish) to grant him the power to conquer his foes. Describe him as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.

> ##### Deep Duerra
>
>Deep Duerra is a lawful evil god of conquest and psionic power. Her symbol is a mind flayer skull.
>
>According to legend, Deep Duerra stole the power of psi from the mind flayers and gifted it to her people. Her command of psionic power was so great that she dominated a mind flayer colony and turned the illithids into her slaves. Inspired by her mythic deeds, her priests are devoted to finding and annihilating mind flayer colonies or turning mind flayers into their thralls.
>

While in this temple, Xardorok has the following additional trait:

***Psychic Conquest.*** Xardorok deals an extra 5 (1d10) psychic damage to any creature he hits with a weapon attack, and he regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of psychic damage dealt.

A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the statue as a depiction of Deep Duerra (see the "Deep Duerra" sidebar). Dwarves have advantage on this check. The flame rising from the statue's head symbolizes Deep Duerra's destructive, all-consuming mind. If a creature uses an action to extinguish this fire, Xardorok loses his Psychic Conquest trait.

The creature chained to the statue's base is a **mind flayer** with 9 hit points and no armor (AC 11). Klondorn, the duergar priest (see area X31), has amputated its face-tentacles and removed the part of its brain that enables the mind flayer to use its psionic powers. Consequently, it has no innate spellcasting abilities and no effective attacks. It retains its Magic Resistance and its telepathy, however. Its challenge rating is 0 (0 XP).

The mind flayer doesn't expect sympathy from the characters and shies away from them. If the characters question it, the mind flayer shares the following information with one of them telepathically:

- The mind flayer's name is **F'yorl**. It was captured by the duergar in the Underdark.
- This room is a temple dedicated to Deep Duerra, a duergar god of conquest and psionics. Xardorok comes here to pray and draws strength from the statue's flame.
- The temple's priest, Klondorn, resides in the room to the southeast (area X31).

***Northwest and Northeast Rooms.*** The temple is flanked by L-shaped rooms to the northwest and northeast. The northwest room contains heaps of cold weather clothing and a dozen pairs of snowshoes. The northeast room contains piles of weapons, including six war picks, nine warhammers, a dozen javelins, ten heavy crossbows, and a nicked greataxe that belongs to the goliath prisoner in area X28.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the temple's walls for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check find such a door in the east wall. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a 5-foot-diameter tunnel that leads to a similar door blocking entry to area X34.

#### X30. Eastern Elevator

>>The elevator shaft terminates in this room. A large stone wheel next to the iron cage turns constantly. West of the wheel is a duergar encased in a cruel-looking exoskeletal construct, his face a mask of pain.
>>

The construct is a **duergar hammerer** (see *appendix C*). It guards this room and attacks intruders on sight.

***Elevator Shaft.*** The 10-foot-wide stone shaft ascends 100 feet to area X6 and 200 feet to area X13.

#### X31. Devil in Disguise

>>This room is filled with stacks of granite tablets. Behind them lurks a long-bearded duergar wearing black robes and a tall black miter.
>>

![Klondorn](img/adventure/IDRotF/153-03-003.klondorn.webp)

Klondorn, the duergar priest of Deep Duerra and Xardorok's trusted advisor, is in fact a **barbed devil**. The devil's miter is a *hat of disguise* that it uses to conceal its true form.

Klondorn is a fiendish emissary sent by Asmodeus to help Xardorok conquer Icewind Dale. Xardorok is unaware of Klondorn's true nature. In the guise of a duergar, the devil earned Xardorok's confidence and refuses to be intimidated by a stray band of adventurers. If the characters threaten Klondorn, it tosses aside the miter, revealing its true form, and attacks. If reduced to 0 hit points, the devil vanishes in a cloud of black smoke and returns to the Nine Hells, leaving its *hat of disguise* behind.

***Infernal Tablets.*** The barbed devil spends its time chiseling on granite tablets to inscribe them with Infernal runes. Characters who can read Infernal script can learn about the devil's manifesto, in which Klondorn reveals that Asmodeus, in the guise of Deep Duerra, is using the duergar to further his interests.

There are ninety-two granite tablets stacked about the room. Each tablet weighs 50 pounds and is 1 foot wide, 1ÃÂ½ feet long, and 2ÃÂ½ inches thick.

***Treasure.*** Aside from the devil's *hat of disguise*, this room contains nothing of value.

#### X32. Trapped Hall

>>Two sets of double doors frame a short corridor. Bolted to the walls are a dozen black boxes, each one measuring eight feet tall and one foot wide, that give off a low hum.
>>

Operating a lever in area X36 deactivates the trap in this hall, which can't be disabled by any other means. Any creature that enters the hall for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the hall is struck by bolts of lightning that leap from the boxes and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### X33. Lower Barracks

The characters hear deep voices speaking Dwarvish and Undercommon as they approach this area.

>>Six duergar sit on stools around three hexagonal tables in the middle of this hall, with a copper keg atop each one. Braziers heaped with glowing-hot coals provide light and heat. Through the smoky haze, you count nine doors embedded in the north, west, and east walls.
>>

Fifteen **duergar** guards occupy this areaÃ¢ÂÂsix relaxing in the main hall and nine more resting in the smaller rooms attached to it. Ten of the duergar have secretly pledged their loyalty to **Grandolpha Muzgardt** (see "The Muzgardt Conspiracy"). If the characters claim to be on Grandolpha's side, the duergar that support her turn against their kin. If the characters let these duergar fight among themselves, five duergar survive the battle, all of them loyal to Grandolpha. They are willing to help the characters slay Xardorok, but any alliance they make with the characters ends with Xardorok's death.

***Copper Kegs.*** The three kegs contain Clan Muzgardt's finest mushroom brew, Darklake Stout, which only a duergar could find palatable.

***Quarters.*** Each of the smaller rooms has three stone bunkbeds protruding from its walls.

#### X34. Torture Chamber

Characters who approach this chamber hear screams of agony coming from inside.

>>Braziers of glowing-hot coals heat and light this room, the walls of which are lined with closed iron sarcophagi standing on end. In the middle of the room, a duergar has been shackled to a chair. Her flesh is covered with blisters. A pair of hooded duergar prod her with hot iron rods, searing her flesh and causing her to bellow in agony.
>>

The unarmed and unarmored **duergar** shackled to the chair is Nefrun, the former captain of the guard. She has 7 hit points remaining. Her torturers are two **duergar mind masters** (see *appendix C*) wearing black hoods.

If **Xardorok Sunblight** (see *appendix C*) is encountered here, he's overseeing the torture of Nefrun, who has been implicated in a plot to assassinate him. Describe Xardorok as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.

The mind masters want their prisoner to identify others involved in the coup against Xardorok. Nefrun is refusing to cooperate and is not guilty of the crimes leveled against her. She suspects Klondorn, the high priest of Deep Duerra (see area X31), has turned Xardorok against her. If she is released, Nefrun intends to demonstrate her loyalty to Xardorok. If that means betraying her liberators, Nefrun does so without question. Nefrun's gear, including her armors and weapons, is on the floor next to the chair.

Xardorok won't fight to the death in this area. Instead, he uses the secret door (see below) to retreat to area X30 and uses the elevator there to make his way toward area X8, where he plans to join forces with **Grandolpha Muzgardt**. Grandolpha goes along with Xardorok but won't aid him in a fight, allowing the characters to kill him. If Xardorok is gravely wounded and Grandolpha can kill him without putting herself in harm's way, she seizes the opportunity.

***Iron Sarcophagi.*** The closed, upright sarcophagi are iron maidens. The room contains ten of these devices, each one with spikes lining the interior of its lid. A Small or Medium creature shackled inside an iron maiden takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage when the lid snaps shut. The creature takes this damage again at the start of each of its turns until it is released. A creature can use an action to try to break out of an iron maiden, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the walls for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds such a door in the west wall. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a 5-foot-wide tunnel that leads to a similar door blocking entry to area X29.

***Torture Closet.*** The small room to the south contains an array of torture devices, including whips, mallets, barbed scourges, spiked chains, branding irons, hooks, thumbscrews, pliers, and shears.

#### X35. Guest Quarters

>>Two beds stand against the south wall of this room, one of them with a yeti hide draped across it. At the foot of each bed is a stone chest next to a stack of five sealed copper kegs. The room is heated and illuminated by glowing coals in stone braziers.
>>

This bedchamber is set aside for honored guests and is currently being used by **Grandolpha Muzgardt**, whom the characters encounter in area X8. The yeti hide on her bed is a gift from Xardorok. The kegs contain Darklake Stout, Clan Muzgardt's finest mushroom ale, which Grandolpha brought with her from the Underdark. She keeps no valuables here, and both chests are empty.

#### X36. Duergar Hammerers

>>Two featureless stone pillars support the vaulted ceiling of this unlit chamber. East of the pillars, a duergar encased in an exoskeletal construct stands before a lowered iron portcullis. A similar creature stands in an alcove to the north, its squeaky pincers clenching and unclenching in nervous anticipation.
>>
>>A stone lever juts out of the back wall of an alcove to the south.
>>

The two **duergar hammerers** (*appendix C*) attack anyone they don't recognize.

***Iron Portcullis.*** When the characters move close to the portcullis, they can see that embedded in the north wall next to it is a 1-foot-square chardalyn plaque with an oversized, hand-shaped indentation on its face. The plaque can't be removed from the wall. If the fingers and palm of Xardorok's gauntlet are placed in the indentation, the portcullis rises into the ceiling, allowing access to area X37. The portcullis can also be raised with a *knock* spell or similar magic. Brute force, in the form of a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, also worksÃ¢ÂÂbut circumventing the locking mechanism in this way causes the portcullises in area X37 to fall, sealing off that room's eight alcoves.

***Stone Lever.*** Pulling down the lever in the south alcove deactivates the trap in area X32, making that tunnel safe to traverse. Raising the lever reactivates the trap.

#### X37. Treasure Vault

The characters can see into this room through the bars of the portcullis that blocks its entrance:

>>This unlit room contains four alcoves on the north wall and four on the south wall. Inside each alcove is an iron chest.
>>

The pointed teeth of a raised iron portcullis jut from the ceiling of each alcove. These barriers fall and lock into place if the characters physically forced open the portcullis that seals the vault's entrance. Placing the fingers and palm of Xardorok's gauntlet in the hand-shaped indentation in area X36 causes all the lowered portcullises in this room to rise. A portcullis can also be raised with a *knock* spell or similar magic.

***Iron Chests.*** Each chest has a built-in combination lock with three tumblers that bear tiny Dwarvish runes representing numerals from 1 to 9. Xardorok keeps the combinations for these chests in his quarters (area X5). A character using thieves' tools can spend 1 minute trying to disable the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens a chest. Here are the chests' descriptions:

**Chest 1** contains a dozen stoppered gourds, each holding a pint of a fiercely hot liquor made from fire lichen, which grows in the Underdark. Each gourd can be sold to a tavernkeeper in Ten-Towns for 10 gp.

**Chest 2** holds a gold mask shaped like the visage of a male drow (750 gp), lying on a bed of 350 gp.

**Chest 3** contains a silver chalice shaped in the likeness of a spider and inlaid with eight obsidian eyes (250 gp).

**Chest 4** holds a bundled-up gray spider-silk robe sewn with darkmantle eyes, wrapped inside which is a *wand of web*.

**Chest 5** contains a folded *piwafwi*Ã¢ÂÂa dark spider-silk cloak made by drow. This item has the properties of a *cloak of elvenkind* but loses its magic if it's exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

**Chest 6** holds an amber headdress set with three large purple pearls (2,500 gp).

**Chest 7** contains a 2-foot-tall stone statuette of Demogorgon that weighs 50 pounds. Anyone who looks into the statue's eyes must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or contract a random form of short-term madness (see "Madness" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). A creature can be affected only once by the statue, after which it becomes immune to the effect.

**Chest 8** houses an inanimate svirfneblin skeleton encrusted with yellow mold (see "*Dungeon Hazards*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). The mold releases its spores as soon as the chest's lid is opened. Embedded in one of the skull's eye sockets is a false eye made of moonstone (75 gp).

## Fortress Fallout

The chardalyn dragon won't return to Xardorok's fortress until it has destroyed Ten-Towns (see the next chapter). If Xardorok is alive and his forge is intact when the dragon returns, Xardorok begins repairing it. The dragon regains 1d6 hit points at the end of each hour of repair work. If Xardorok is slain or the red dragon's heart in the forge is destroyed, the chardalyn dragon can't be repaired.

After returning to the fortress, the dragon remains there until such time as Xardorok needs it to cause more devastation, and certainly not before Xardorok's duergar scouts have assessed the damage to Ten-Towns.

Xardorok's demise spells the doom of the Sunblight clan if neither of his sons are alive to take command. If **Grandolpha Muzgardt** outlives Xardorok, she absorbs the remnants of the Sunblight clan into her own and has Xardorok's surviving sons executed. The Muzgardt clan takes over Xardorok's fortress but has no immediate designs against Ten-Towns or Icewind Dale. If the characters were instrumental in helping Grandolpha capture the fortress, she allows them to keep any treasures they found in the fortress but insists that they leave at once.

If Xardorok and Grandolpha are both still alive when the characters depart the fortress, the division among the two duergar clans continues to deepen, but no immediate effort is made to unseat Xardorok. Grandolpha is content to bide her time, betraying Xardorok only after some setback leaves him weak and vulnerable.

# Chapter 4: Destruction's Light

**Xardorok Sunblight**'s merciless construct slices through Ten-Towns with its radiant beam.

Ten-Towns won't survive the attack of Xardorok's dragon without the characters' intervention. This chapter describes the dragon's attacks on Ten-Towns and what the characters can do to minimize the destruction and save as many Ten-Towners as possible. The extent to which they can help depends on their actions in the previous chapter:

- If the characters delayed their return to Ten-Towns to confront Xardorok in his lair, the amount of time they spent in Xardorok's fortress determines how many Ten-Towns settlements are victimized before the characters can intervene, based on the dragon's timeline.
- If the characters forgo the attack on Xardorok's fortress and waste no time chasing after the dragon, they have a good chance of catching up to it before too many Ten-Towns settlements are lost.

The point of this chapter, beyond pitting the characters against a formidable draconic foe, is to make the players aware that their characters' choices have consequences. If the characters do nothing to stop the dragon, Ten-Towns will be destroyed. Many lives hang in the balance.

## Running This Chapter

Review the **chardalyn dragon's** stat block and description in *appendix C* before running this chapter of the adventure. Stopping the dragon will be a daunting task for the characters. Fortunately, they won't have to fight it alone.

From the moment it leaves the fortress, the chardalyn dragon begins to carry out Xardorok's plan to level Ten-Towns one settlement after another. The characters can intervene by successfully predicting where the dragon will strike next and confronting it. The "Return to Ten-Towns" section provides characters with a much-needed ally and a swift dogsled ride back to Ten-Towns. The "Dragon Scourge" section describes how long it takes for the dragon to reach each town, the defenses each settlement musters against it, and the likely outcome if no help from the characters is forthcoming. The "Showdown!" section helps you run an encounter involving the characters and the dragon. Regardless of what happens to Ten-Towns, the "Vellynne's Quest" section sets up the final three chapters of the adventure.

### Character Advancement

The characters gain a level if they contribute to the dragon's destruction. If they're not 7th level by the end of this chapter, lure them to some of the locations in *chapter 2* so that they can gain enough levels before continuing with the later chapters.

## Return to Ten-Towns

As the characters start to make their way back to Ten-Towns, read:

>>Over the sound of the wind, you can hear the barking of dogs getting louder. Through the blowing snow come three wooden sleds pulled by canines as big as wolves. The closest driver calls out, "Can we be of service?"
>>

The figure calling to the party is **Vellynne Harpell** (see appendix C), a wizard of the Arcane Brotherhood. She is cocooned in cold weather clothing, her face all but hidden behind a wool muffler. Her snowy **owl** familiar is perched on her shoulder. Her sled has two **Icewind kobold zombies** riding on it, their acid-eaten forms visible through gashes in their hide armor. Steering the other two sleds are four **Icewind kobolds**, two per sled. (See appendix C for the kobolds' stat blocks.) Each sled is pulled by six strong dogs (use the **wolf** stat block).

Vellynne was searching in Ten-Towns for a group of adventurers to help her complete a personal mission when she learned about the characters' earlier acts of bravery (as displayed in *chapters 1* and *2*). She decided to try to catch up to them and earn their friendship. Although the fate of Ten-Towns doesn't concern her, Vellynne hopes the characters will help her obtain *The Codicil of White* once they learn to trust her. With this ulterior motive in mind, Vellynne offers the characters her sleds for traveling back to Ten-Towns and can easily be persuaded to help fight the dragon. ("A wizard worth her weight never passes up a chance to test her magic against the mightiest foes," she says brazenly.)

There's room in the kobolds' sleds to transport the characters and their gear. If the characters insist on steering these sleds, the kobolds fuss about handing over the reins but do so, piling into the cargo beds. If the characters refuse to travel with the kobolds, Vellynne jettisons her little sidekicks without a second thoughtÃ¢ÂÂthe characters are much more valuable to her than the kobolds.

If the characters aren't sure where to go next, Vellynne suggests that they travel to the place where Ten-Towners are most likely to make their final stand against the dragon: the town of Bryn Shander. (Characters who found and studied Xardorok's attack plan in *chapter 3* might have a different idea.) If the characters take Vellynne's advice and head to Bryn Shander, they will be playing into Xardorok's hands. The dragon is saving Bryn Shander for last, because Xardorok knows that refugees from the smaller towns have nowhere else to go but there. Bryn Shander's walls provide no defense against the dragon's attacks from the sky, and the closer Ten-Towners huddle together, the easier it becomes for the dragon to annihilate them.

### Roleplaying Vellynne

Vellynne is a pragmatist who tries to stay one step ahead of her competition, in particular her rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood (of whom she rarely speaks). To continue her mission in Icewind Dale, she needs the aid of stalwart adventurers, and she knows that helping them battle the dragon is a golden opportunity to earn the characters' respect if not their trust.

Vellynne is open about her intentions if the characters are suspicious and confront her. She is willing to postpone her mission until the threat of the dragon is no more, and tells the characters as much.

For more information on **Vellynne** and her motivations, see the "Arcane Brotherhood" section in *appendix C*.

## Dragon Scourge

This section describes the dragon's flight path and the events it sets in motion. The section assumes no interference on the part of the characters; when they and the dragon finally meet, skip ahead to the "Showdown!" section.

The dragon can regain hit points only if Xardorok repairs it in his forge (see "Fortress Fallout").

### Dragon's Flight Path

*Map 4.1* shows the dragon's flight path, which should not be shared with your players unless the characters studied Xardorok's attack plan in the previous chapter. The dragon is following the instructions of its creator precisely and will not deviate from this course under any circumstances.

Each section describes the damage caused to each town, what (if any) damage the town deals to the dragon in return, and how much time the dragon spent at that town. Adjust the dragon's timeline and the extent of the damage as you see fit.

The Dragon Flight Times table shows how long it takes for the dragon to get from one location the next one.

##### Dragon Flight Times
|           From/To          | Flight Time |
|:--------------------------:|:-----------:|
| Sunblight to Dougan's Hole |   2 hours   |
| Dougan's Hole to Good Mead |  30 minutes |
|   Good Mead to Easthaven   |   1ÃÂ½ hours  |
|  Easthaven to Caer-Dineval |    1 hour   |
| Caer-Dineval to Caer-Konig |    1 hour   |
|  Caer-Konig to Termalaine  |   2 hours   |
|  Termalaine to Lonelywood  |  30 minutes |
|    Lonelywood to Bremen    |   1ÃÂ½ hours  |
|      Bremen to Targos      |  30 minutes |
|   Targos to Bryn Shander   |  30 minutes |
|  Bryn Shander to Sunblight |   3ÃÂ½ hours  |

![Map 4.1: Dragons Flight Path](img/adventure/IDRotF/155-map-4.1-dragons-flight-path.webp)

#### Target 1: Dougan's Hole

The dragon destroys every structure in town, including the docks, in 30 minutes. It leaves the Twenty Stones of Thruun untouched. (It was always Xardorok's intention to study this ancient site to see what power could be drawn from it.)

***Casualties.*** Twenty-five people (half of the population) are killed. The survivors, including Speaker Durmoot, flee to Bryn Shander with their most cherished possessions and some of their livestock.

***Dragon Damage.*** The dragon takes no damage.

#### Target 2: Good Mead

The dragon spares the Mead Hall, but it destroys every other structure in town in 1 hour.

***Casualties.*** Twenty-five people (one-quarter of the population) are killed. The survivors flee into the woods before veering toward the Eastway and following the road to Bryn Shander, taking most of their livestock with them.

***Dragon Damage.*** The dragon takes no damage.

#### Target 3: Easthaven

Here, the dragon faces its first real challenge. Although it catches the town by surprise, the militia reacts quickly and succeeds in wounding the creature.

The dragon uses its radiant breath weapon to strafe the town from the air, never landing. It starts at the east end and slowly works its way westward, clearing streets and obliterating homes. It takes 8 hours, but the dragon destroys half the town's structures, including most of its docks. The White Lady Inn partially collapses when the dragon flies through it, and the Wet Trout is razed. The Town Hall and the Easthaven ferry are spared.

***Casualties.*** Two hundred fifty people (one-third of the population), including most of the town's militia, are killed. Captain Arlaggath is slain by two invisible **duergar** who have been waiting impatiently for the dragon to strike. The five hundred survivors flee on foot to Bryn Shander, taking their most cherished possessions and livestock with them.

If he's alive and present when the dragon attacks, Speaker Waylen is killed when six **duergar** storm the Town Hall and confiscate any chardalyn they find there.

***Dragon Damage.*** The attack on Easthaven reduces the dragon's hit points by 10.

#### Target 4: Caer-Dineval

The dragon lands between the castle and the rest of the town. It then moves through town, leveling one structure after another. All buildings aside from the castle, including the Uphill Climb and Dinev's Rest, are destroyed in 1 hour. The castle and its inhabitants are spared, for it was Xardorok's intention to trap the Knights of the Black Sword in their self-made prison (not unlike the fate of their dark master, Levistus).

***Casualties.*** If he's still alive and confined to his castle, Speaker Siever survives. Everyone living outside the castle is killed, either by the dragon or by the six **duergar** lurking in Dinev's Rest. When the dragon attacks, the duergar emerge from the dilapidated inn, enlarge themselves to ogre size, and join the battle.

***Dragon Damage.*** The dragon takes no damage.

#### Target 5: Caer-Konig

The dragon destroys every structure in town in 1ÃÂ½ hours. Speaker Trovus, the town's dragonborn defender, is passed out drunk in a snowbank throughout the entire ordeal and wakes to find his settlement wiped out.

***Casualties.*** Fifty people (one-third of the population) are killed, a few at the hands of an invisible **duergar** lurking about town. Among the dead are the Shorard sisters, whose inn collapses on top of them, and Atenas Swift, who dies helping several citizens escape on dogsleds. Speaker Trovus survives but never conquers his guilt; he does, however, give up the bottle. Jarthra Farzassh survives and leads most of the town's evacuees to the ruins of Caer-Dineval, only to be denied entry into the castle. Before they can leave Caer-Dineval, Jarthra and several others are murdered by the duergar lurking in town (see "Target 4: Caer-Dineval" above). Only fifty refugees from Caer-Konig make it all the way to Bryn Shander.

***Dragon Damage.*** Trovus was the town's best hope for defense. Because he was unconscious during the attack, no organized resistance was mounted. Consequently, the dragon takes no damage.

#### Target 6: Termalaine

Termalaine's residents take refuge in the nearby mines while the militia defends the town.

The dragon takes 6 hours to destroy the town, leaving no building unharmed. The Eastside is only partially damaged and remains open for business after the dragon's attack. The Blue Clam is destroyed, as are most of Termalaine's docks and boats.

***Casualties.*** The town militia is wiped out, and twenty of the town's residents perish in their homes. Another thirty residents are killed in a mine collapse triggered by **duergar** saboteurs. Half of the remaining five hundred people flee to Targos and continue to Bryn Shander, while the rest (including Speaker Masthew) remain holed up in the mines.

***Dragon Damage.*** The attack on Termalaine reduces the dragon's hit points by 5.

#### Target 7: Lonelywood

Local fishers witness the dragon's attack on Termalaine and rush home to alert their families and neighbors.

When the dragon reaches Lonelywood, the town is empty, its residents having retreated to the woods or sailed to Targos. The dragon takes 2 hours to lay waste to the empty town, leveling every building and destroying every dock.

***Casualties.*** None as a direct result of the dragon's attack.

***Dragon Damage.*** The dragon takes no damage.

#### Target 8: Bremen

As the dragon flies over Maer Dualdon, it spots many of Bremen's residents crossing the lake in boats and sinks them. When it reaches the town, the dragon takes 2 hours to lay waste to the docks and flatten every building.

***Casualties.*** One hundred people (two-thirds of the population) are killed, either in boats or in the town proper, including Speaker Shalescar, Cora Mulphoon, and the entire militia. The remaining fifty residents flee to Bryn Shander, leaving everything behind.

***Dragon Damage.*** Bremen's militia puts up a good fight, reducing the dragon's hit points by 5.

#### Target 9: Targos

Speaker Maxildanarr's network of spies throughout Ten-Towns alerted him to the dragon shortly after its attacks began, allowing Targos time to prepare. The local militia swells with furious residents eager to defend their town, and siege weapons are brought to bear. Unfortunately, many of the town's prepared defenses are undermined by **duergar** saboteurs.

It takes the dragon 8 hours to reduce Targos to a smoldering ruin. The dragon ignores the town's walls for the most part and focuses on the buildings, leveling one after another.

***Casualties.*** Five hundred people (half the population) are killed by the dragon or by duergar moving invisibly through town and indiscriminately murdering people. The survivors flee to Bryn Shander, taking their most prized possessions and livestock with them.

The militia makes its final stand outside the Luskan Arms, by which time Speaker Maxildanarr has fled to a Zhentarim safe house in Bryn Shander. Skath, his faithful tiefling militia captain, is one of many sacrificial pawns left behind to cover his escape.

***Dragon Damage.*** The Targos militia, the toughest opposition the dragon has faced, reduces the dragon's hit points by 15.

#### Target 10: Bryn Shander

By the time the dragon shows up, Bryn Shander is bursting at the seams with refugees from other settlements. This is where Ten-Towns makes its final stand. Although the outer walls offer no defense against the flying dragon, people can hide in the town's root cellars.

The dragon strafes the town for 6 hours, remaining airborne the whole time and eliminating anyone who tries to get away. It then lands inside the walls and spends another 6 hours going from one smoldering ruin to the next, hunting down survivors. After 12 hours of attacks on Bryn Shander, the dragon returns to Xardorok's fortress for repairs. (If Xardorok is dead, no repairs are forthcoming, and the dragon remains at the duergar fortress.)

The Northlook is damaged but not destroyed. Both Blackiron Blades and the House of the Morninglord are lost, along with almost every other establishment.

While the dragon does its work, **duergar** prowl through town, murdering leaders, spellcasters, and other key figures.

***Casualties.*** Bryn Shander's population balloons from 1,200 to 2,700 when the refugees from other settlements are accounted for. The dragon and the duergar claim 200 lives each hour, leaving the devastated town with a population of 300 when all is said and done. Roughly half of these survivors are Bryn Shander natives; the rest are refugees from other settlements.

Scramsax, the proprietor of the Northlook, falls to the dragon. Mishann, the priest of Amaunator, administers healing as best she can and survives without injury. Sheriff Markham Southwell personally thwarts a duergar assassination attempt against Speaker Duvessa Shane; both leaders are scarred but survive.

Speaker Durmoot of Dougan's Hole is killed by duergar, but Speaker Maxildanarr of Targos survives.

***Dragon Damage.*** Bryn Shander benefits from strong leadership, a tested militia, and helpful spellcasters. In the first 6 hours, the dragon's hit points decrease by 10. Once the dragon lands and begins searching through wreckage, its hit points decrease at a rate of 5 per hour.

## Showdown!

The dragon's flying speed is greater than the characters' overland movement speed or the flying speed available to characters who can cast *fly* spells, so the party has little hope of catching up to the dragon before it reaches Ten-Towns. The characters' best chance of destroying the dragon is to pick a settlement and wait for the dragon there. If the characters saw Xardorok's battle plan in the previous chapter, they know the order in which the settlements of Ten-Towns will be attacked.

The dragon's preferred tactic is to strafe each settlement from the air, using its breath weapon to incinerate people and structures alike. It then soars out of missile range until its breath weapon recharges. After dealing as much damage as it can from the air, the dragon lands and begins searching through the smoldering ruins to eliminate any survivors.

Whenever the characters engage the dragon, they buy time for Ten-Towners to flee. Reduce a town's losses as you see fit to account for the characters' interference.

![Heroes are all that stand between Ten-Towns and certain destruction](img/adventure/IDRotF/156-04-001.dragon.webp)

### When the Dragon Takes Damage

If the characters deal 30 damage or more to the dragon and it's not destroyed, it flies to the next town. If this happens in Bryn Shander, the dragon flies back to Xardorok's fortress and remains there, in the forge. If Xardorok is still alive in this fortress, he makes the necessary repairs. The dragon regains 1d6 hit points at the end of every hour of repair work.

#### Destroying the Dragon

When the dragon drops to 0 hit points, read:

>>The dragon makes a horrific grinding noise as it begins to shudder and crumble to pieces. As its great bulk crashes into the snow, jagged shards of black crystal fly off in all directions.
>>

The dragon leaves behind hundreds of chardalyn fragments, some as big as a wagon wheel and others as small as a coffin nail. If the characters know the effects of chardalyn tainted by evil magic, they'll want to warn Ten-Towners to avoid the fragments.

### Weather Conditions

The dragon begins its attacks under dark, clear skies. That changes shortly after it leaves Termalaine, its sixth target, for that's when a winter storm sweeps down from the Reghed Glacier and engulfs Ten-Towns. The storm hangs over Ten-Towns for 24 hours before petering out.

If the characters confront the dragon in Lonelywood, Bremen, Targos, or Bryn Shander, they must also contend with strong wind and heavy snowfall (for rules, see "*Strong Wind*" and "*Heavy Precipitation*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). The dragon ignores these effects, having been built by Xardorok to overcome such debilitating weather.

### NPC Support

Ten-Towners are happy to let adventurers fight the dragon while they flee for their lives. If the characters are the ones who need saving, you can have one or more courageous NPCs help them.

#### Helpful Ten-Towners

If a character ends up in a tight spot, you can have a friendly NPC act immediately before the character in the initiative order. This NPC can help the imperiled character in one of the following ways:

- The NPC uses the Help action to assist the character.
- If the character is dying, the NPC stabilizes them or carries them to a safer location.
- The NPC moves close enough to the dragon to provide a distraction, allowing the character to move to a safer location or use a class feature that relies on an ally being near the dragon (such as Sneak Attack).

#### What Can Vellynne Do?

**Vellynne Harpell's** survival is important for the story to continue forward. She fights alongside the party but does not participate in any foolhardy acts of heroism.

During encounters with the dragon, Vellynne can't drop below 1 hit point. If she is reduced to 1 hit point, she either retreats to somewhere safe or uses her next action to cast *vampiric touch*, draining the life force of her nearest kobold minion (or some other poor fool) to ensure her own survival.

Vellynne's most potent spells are useless against the dragon construct, so she relies on her *wand of magic missiles*, using its charges sparingly. She can also focus her efforts on clearing the streets of innocent bystanders and coordinating the party's actions with those of the local militia. (As she likes to say, "It's a weak wizard who relies on spells alone.")

After the dragon returns to Xardorok's fortress or is destroyed, Vellynne asks the characters to forget about Ten-Towns for a while and help her find a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier (see "Vellynne's Quest" at the end of the chapter).

If you're unable to save Vellynne for whatever reason, have the characters discover a journal in her belongings that contains all the information she knows, or have one of her kobold minions communicate the information necessary to keep the adventure on track.

### Other Things Characters Can Do

Characters who can't harm the dragon (or choose not to) can find plenty of other things to distract them during the dragon's attack. If a player is having trouble figuring out what their character can or should do, you can use the Town in Chaos table to introduce an urgent development for the character to deal with. Before the character moves or acts on its turn, roll on the table or choose a development you think might spur the character into action.

##### Town in Chaos
|  d20  | Development          |
|:-----:|----------------------|
|  1Ã¢ÂÂ3  | Building collapse    |
|  4Ã¢ÂÂ6  | Enlarged duergar     |
|  7Ã¢ÂÂ9  | Invisible duergar    |
| 10Ã¢ÂÂ14 | Malevolent townsfolk |
| 15Ã¢ÂÂ16 | Thieves              |
| 17Ã¢ÂÂ18 | Trapped beast        |
| 19Ã¢ÂÂ20 | Walking wounded      |

#### Building Collapse

>>A damaged building collapses twenty feet away from you. The noise of crashing walls and shattered timbers fades, replaced by the screams of people trapped in the wreckage.
>>

There are 1d4 + 1 people trapped in the collapsed building. All of them are **commoners** suffering from broken bones, lacerations, and concussions, and half of them (rounded down) are at 0 hit points and dying; the rest have 1 hit point each.

A character can rush to the building and use an action to try to pull a Ten-Towner out of the wreckage, doing so with a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check, whereupon the character can try to stabilize a dying commoner or use healing magic to restore their hit points and remove their injuries.

#### Enlarged Duergar

>>Panicked Ten-Towners rush past youÃ¢ÂÂnot to escape the dragon but to get away from a heavily armored, gray-skinned dwarf as big as an ogre. It yells in Dwarvish as it stomps through the snow toward you.
>>

This enlarged **duergar** fights to the death, shouting, "No more winters for Ten-Towns!" in Dwarvish as it does so. The duergar has already used its Invisibility trait and can't use it again until it finishes a short or long rest.

#### Invisible Duergar

>>Something unseen is making footprints in the snow, and those footprints are getting closer!
>>

A **duergar** is using its Invisibility trait to get close enough to the character to make an attack, but the snow betrays its presence, giving the character the chance to act first.

When the duergar gets within striking distance, it attacks and becomes visible. Following its initial attack, it uses an action to increase its size, then presses its attack.

#### Malevolent Townsfolk

>>Unrecognizable figures in cold weather clothing advance until they form a line twenty feet away from you. Each one clutches a handaxe threateningly. One of them points a gloved finger at you and shouts, "Kill that one first!"
>>

The character is singled out by 1d4 + 2 **commoners** who have become corrupted by the chardalyn dragon's Malevolent Presence. Each one wields a handaxe that deals 3 (1d6) slashing damage on a hit. These townsfolk act on the same initiative count.

Rather than make saving throws for the commoners to end the effect of the dragon's Malevolent Presence on them, roll a d6 at the end of each of their turns. On a 6, the townsfolk regain their senses and cease to be hostile as the dragon's hold over them ends.

#### Thieves

>>The chaos has brought out the worst in some Ten-Towners. About twenty feet away, you see two thugs in cold weather clothing beating up an old woman and stealing her food.
>>

The two **thugs** are neutral evil humans, and the old woman is a **commoner** with 1 hit point remaining. A character can use an action to try to make the thugs drop the woman's food and run away, doing so with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation) check. A thug that takes any damage also runs away.

#### Trapped Beast

>>A strange noise draws your attention to an axe beak loaded down with sacks and tied to a wooden post. The beast lets out a panicked cry as it struggles to free itself. Its owner is nowhere to be seen.
>>

You can replace the **axe beak** with a mule, a sled dog, or any other domesticated beast. A character can use an action to try to calm the beast until the end of its next turn, doing so with a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. While the beast is calm, the character can use an action to untie or cut the rope that tethers it to the wooden post. A character can also try to cut the rope with an edged weapon without first calming the beast, doing so with a successful attack against AC 15, enabling the panicked beast to bolt away on its next turn.

#### Walking Wounded

>>A Ten-Towner in torn cold weather clothing stumbles into view, falls in the snow, and gets back up. From twenty feet away, you can see that the person is leaving a trail of blood in the snow.
>>

On a roll of 19, the figure is a badly wounded member of the local militia (an unarmed **tribal warrior** with 1 hit point remaining). On a roll of 20, the figure is an uninjured, opportunistic **doppelganger** posing as a wounded Ten-Towner.

***Militia Member.*** Having lost their spear fighting the dragon, this member of the town militia is searching for a replacement weapon. If given a weapon, the militia member heads back into battle.

***Doppelganger.*** The doppelganger (which has smeared itself with someone else's blood) asks to be taken to a safe location out of the dragon's sight. If a character obliges, the doppelganger tries to slay, rob, and replace its "savior" in a location where its treachery can't be observed by anyone else.

## Vellynne's Quest

**Vellynne Harpell** needs help reaching *Ythryn*, a quest that propels the characters through the final chapters of this adventure. However, she is reluctant to share details of her mission until the following conditions are met:

- The chardalyn dragon is no longer an immediate concern.
- The characters have the experience needed to survive the perils that await them in the first stage of the quest. (In other words, the characters are at least 7th level.)

These conditions don't account for any unfinished business that the characters are determined to resolve. For example, if **Xardorok Sunblight** is still alive, the characters might want to finish him off before turning their attention elsewhere.

Once she's confident that the characters are ready for the challenges that lie ahead, Vellynne makes her bold proposition:

>>"I need your help to find an ancient city buried under the ice. This city, Ythryn, is a lost fragment of the Empire of Netheril, whose wizards created many of the magic items we find scattered across the world today. It holds magic beyond our wildest dreams. We might even find something there to end this hateful winter. Intrigued?"
>>

If characters want to hear more or leave an opening for Vellynne to keep talking, she adds:

>>"Using divination magic, the Arcane Brotherhood has learned that the city is buried deep inside the Reghed Glacier. But the glacier can be cracked open at a place where a waterfall once flowed down its side but has since frozen. We have already found the waterfall. All we need now is the magic to break open the glacier."
>>

Vellynne learned a few things from her *professor orb* (see *appendix D*) before it was stolen from her. She shares the following information with characters who want to know more about Netheril:

- Netheril was a vast human empire ruled by wizards, whose mastery of the Weave remains unsurpassed to this day.
- Some of what the Netherese wizards learned came from the elves. The rest came from the study of artifacts called the *Nethe**r Scrolls*.
- The Netherese created magic that was more powerful than a *wish* spell and used it to accomplish the impossible. Their magic could shear the tops of mountains and lift entire cities into the sky.
- To hold Ythryn aloft, the Netherese wizards would have needed a powerful magic item called a *mythallar*. It likely survived the crash and might have other properties as well, including the ability to change the weather. ("Think of what that could mean for Icewind Dale!" Vellynne adds excitedly.)

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/158-04-003.webp)

### The Codicil and the Orb

Before beginning their search for Ythryn, Vellynne and the characters need two objects: *The Codicil of White* and Vellynne's *professor orb*, which she calls *Professor Skant*. Vellynne has every reason to believe that both items are currently on an island in the Sea of Moving Ice.

#### The Codicil

Vellynne describes this book as follows:

>>"Written and guarded by Auril's followers, *The Codicil of White* is rumored to contain a spell or ritual that can carve a passage through the Reghed Glacier, under which the lost city Ythryn is buried. Divination magic has revealed that the book is being held in a frost giant fortress on a mist-shrouded island in the Sea of Moving Ice."
>>

Vellynne knows that any quest to retrieve *The Codicil of White* is likely to attract Auril's attention. Members of the Arcane Brotherhood are notoriously brazen, which is why Vellynne does not balk at the thought of a confrontation with the Frostmaiden. If Auril's name comes up, Vellynne tries to allay concerns by pointing out the obvious: "Any god who chooses to live among mortals is hiding from something, and anyone who needs to hide can't be all-powerful."

#### Professor Skant

Vellynne's family has a private collection of magic items. The *professor orb* known as *Professor Skant* was part of that collection, and Vellynne wants it back for both practical and sentimental reasons:

>>"The orb is a family heirloom that was stolen from me by a former colleague named Nass Lantomir. The orb has the personality of a scholar and is named Professor Skant. Its knowledge will help us once we descend into Ythryn. Nass is after *The Codicil of White*. Find Nass, and we find Professor Skant."
>>

Vellynne describes the *professor orb*'s properties (see *appendix D*) if the characters want to know more about it.

### Next Steps

The rest of the adventure depends on the characters agreeing to help Vellynne. She has a couple of cards that she plays to convince the characters to do so. She hopes they're motivated by the hope of finding something in Ythryn that can end Auril's everlasting winter. Failing that, there's the promise of finding long-lost spells and magic items.

Assuming the characters agree to undertake Vellynne's quest, their first challenge is getting to the island. Proceed with *chapter 5*, which begins with how the characters solve their transportation problem.

# Chapter 5: Auril's Abode

The fortress of Grimskalle, built by frost giants, now serves as the abode of Auril the Frostmaiden.

Auril the Frostmaiden has retreated to a floating island of ice and snow and turned a skull-shaped fortress formerly occupied by frost giants into her abode. Her presence makes the island the most frigid place in the Far North. The cold is unbearable for many visitors, whose corpses become part of the island's frozen decor.

Ideally, the characters should be 7th level when they visit the island, although there's nothing stopping them from exploring it at lower levels. They might visit the island for either of the following reasons:

- **Vellynne Harpell**, a member of the Arcane Brotherhood, invites the characters to join her on an expedition to the island (see chapter 4 for more information).
- The characters come to the island on their own, hoping to put an end to Icewind Dale's everlasting winter.

## Running This Chapter

Be sure to review the " *Auril the Frostmaiden*" section in appendix C before running this chapter, since Auril is no ordinary villain.

The characters can locate and obtain both *The Codicil of White* and **Vellynne Harpell**'s stolen *professor orb* without confronting the Frostmaiden. But if the characters want to end the Everlasting Rime right here, right now, they can do so by slaying Iskra, the Frostmaiden's roc (without which Auril can't cast her nightly spell that keeps the sun at bay), or by facing Auril in battle and defeating all three of the Frostmaiden's forms sequentially.

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, level advancement is handled as follows:

- The characters gain a level if they destroy all three of Auril's forms.
- The characters gain a level if they slay Iskra the roc.
- If they are 7th level or lower, the characters gain a level when they discover the "Rime of the Frostmaiden" poem in *The Codicil of White*.

## Sea of Moving Ice

Titanic icebergs bob in a churning black sea of unknown depth, crashing into one another with destructive results. Floating amid these mountains of ice, shrouded by mist, is Auril's island. Using sheer force of will, the Frostmaiden can anchor the island or cause it to slowly drift about. For that reason, the island doesn't appear on maps of the Sea of Moving Ice.

### Getting to the Island

The characters can reach Auril's island in any of the following ways:

- Hitch a ride on Angajuk, the awakened sperm whale (see "Angajuk's Bell").
- Travel to Revel's End (see "Revel's End") and book passage on a ship bringing supplies or convicts to the prison.
- Ask the Akannathi goliaths (see "Skytower Shelter") to loan them some trained griffons and then fly to the island on the griffons' backs.

#### Via Angajuk the Sperm Whale

The characters can get directions to the pier where Angajuk can be summoned and befriended. **Vellynne Harpell** knows the location of Angajuk's pier; if she's with the party, she proposes that they spend a night in the town of Bremen and set out to Angajuk's pier in the morning.

Angajuk can travel up to 25 miles a day but takes a leisurely, meandering route to Auril's island, resulting in a three-day journey. The whale is submerged for most of the trip, allowing the characters to see what life is like in the frigid depths. Like a tour guide, the whale takes its passengers within sight of spectacular underwater attractions, including shipwrecks, storm giant castles, and cyclopean ruins from the bygone empire of giants known as Ostoria.

After delivering the characters safely to the island, Angajuk is willing to circle the island until the characters are ready to leave, provided they don't make the whale wait for too long. Auril's roc poses a threat to Angajuk, so the whale surfaces only when it must.

#### Via Ship from Revel's End

The prison of Revel's End has easy access to the Sea of Moving Ice. On the downside, captains who are brave enough to take their ships into the Sea of Moving Ice expect to be well compensated; characters can expect to pay 1,000 gp or more for a one-way trip to Auril's island, or five times that amount if they expect the ship to wait for them and take them back to Revel's End.

One such captain is Sharlasta Stormsword, a retired pirate (lawful evil human **bandit captain**) who commands the *Ravenous*, a sailing ship with a crew of twenty well-trained scalawags (**bandits**). The ship's port of call is the city of Neverwinter. Despite her checkered past, Captain Stormsword is one of the most reliable privateers working for the Lords' Alliance today, and she rarely turns down a chance to earn a little extra coin on the side. Each dawn, she tosses a barrel of fish and a cask of whiskey into the sea as offerings to UmberleeÃ¢ÂÂa practice that keeps the evil sea god on her side.

When the characters arrive at Revel's End, there's a 10 percent chance that the *Ravenous* is moored at the pier and is in the process of offloading crates of supplies as well as 1d4 convicts in shackles. Characters who aren't so lucky must wait 1d10 days for the ship to arrive.

The *Ravenous* can travel 50 miles a day. But finding Auril's island while avoiding close encounters with icebergs and ice floes takes five days. Under no circumstances will Captain Stormsword or her crew leave their ship to explore the island.

If you need a map of the *Ravenous*, use the ship map in *appendix C* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

#### Via Griffons

The goliaths of Skytower Shelter agree to loan the party members one griffon apiece if one of these conditions is met:

- A goliath character who is a member of the Akannathi clan convinces the Akannathi chieftain to help the party by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
- The characters help to end the longstanding feud between the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and the goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag.

Skytower Shelter's griffons are safe to ride, but they are trained to return home after delivering the characters to their destination. Convincing a griffon to remain on Auril's island while the characters explore the place requires a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, and even then, the griffon won't stay for more than 24 hours due to the unbearable cold.

The goliaths don't have enough griffons to carry **Vellynne Harpell**'s kobold entourage, which forces Vellynne to leave her charges behind. The kobolds are happy to stay with the goliaths, but the goliaths quickly dispose of the undead ones.

## Island of Solstice

The island of Solstice is shaped like a snowflake, with six jagged arms that protrude out into the sea. It's a windswept place made primarily of snow and ice.

### Preparing for Arrival

Regardless of the means by which the characters travel to the island, assume that they arrive near the ruined dock on the island's southeast arm. This puts them on the far side of the island from where the wizard Nass Lantomir met her doom.

Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players, whether the characters approach the island by sea or air:

>>The fog through which you've been traveling thins enough for you to see fifty-foot-high cliffs of solid ice ahead. Jutting out of the water off the coast are the bare, weather-beaten masts of sunken ships.
>>
>>Ahead, you can make out what appears to be a partially shattered dock carved out of ice. As you get closer, it becomes obvious that the dock was made for giants.
>>

The ruined ice dock and the shipwrecks in the vicinity are the only features of the island immediately visible. Fog prevents the characters from seeing the island's other features at a distance.

Characters flying on the backs of griffons can bypass the dock and find somewhere else on the island to land. But if one or more griffons come within 200 feet of the fortress of Grimskalle while Auril's **roc** is atop the fortress, it takes to the air and tries to kill the griffons so that their riders fall. (See area G9 in this chapter for more information about the roc.)

### Regional Effects

Auril's presence creates the following regional effects, which fade 1d10 days after all three of her forms are destroyed:

- The save DC to resist the effects of extreme cold is 15 instead of 10.
- Whenever a creature that lacks resistance or immunity to cold damage spends a Hit Die to regain hit points within 1 mile of the island, it regains only a number of hit points equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). It doesn't get to roll the die.
- The island, its surface features, and all creatures and objects out to a distance of 200 feet from the island are lightly obscured by fog. Thick fog fills the air beginning 200 feet from the island and extending outward for 1 mile in all directions; anything on the water or in the air within this thick fog is heavily obscured.

![Map 5.1: Island of Solstice](img/adventure/IDRotF/160-map-5.1-island-of-solstice.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/161-map-5.1-island-of-solstice-player.webp)
### Island Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 5.1.

#### I1. Ruined Dock

Frost giants fashioned this dock out of ice and built it to endure, yet sections of it have broken away and fallen into the sea. Because the dock was scaled for frost giant longships, characters approaching by water must climb to reach the top of it. Those without magic or climbing gear can do so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

At the back of the dock, giant-sized steps climb to the top of the 50-foot-high cliffs. A 20-foot-wide path made from bricks of ice leads from the dock to the fortress of Grimskalle, as shown on map 5.1.

An **ice mephit** named SÃÂ¶po is perched at the top of the ice stairs and is willing to serve as a guide for new arrivals, not out of kindness but to alleviate its boredom. If the characters approach by air, SÃÂ¶po intercepts them. Characters who speak Aquan or Auran can communicate with SÃÂ¶po verbally; if there's no one in the party who can understand it, the mephit communicates using gestures as best it can.

SÃÂ¶po enjoys watching other creatures suffer. Initially, however, it acts as a guide to earn the characters' trust, pointing out areas where characters might slip on a patch of ice or get bonked on the head by a low-hanging icicle. Vellynne's snowy owl familiar, if it's present, senses the mephit's cruel intent. SÃÂ¶po and the owl have an instant dislike for one another.

SÃÂ¶po tries to get the characters to explore every part of the island by sharing the following information with those who can understand its words:

- The shipwrecks that surround the island are full of loot waiting to be claimed.
- The last ship to visit the island crashed off the coast of the island's northwest arm. One survivor managed to pull herself out of the frigid water and climb to the top of the island, but she died before getting any farther.
- The Frostmaiden has created beautiful ice sculptures all over the island. One would weep at the very sight of them if it were not so cold as to make tears freeze in one's eyes.
- There are yeti caves on the east side of the island. An abominable yeti called Korgrah lives among them.

If shooed away, SÃÂ¶po continues to follow the party but doesn't meddle. Whenever some misfortune befalls a character, however, the mephit lets slip a raspy cackle.

#### I2. Shipwrecks

The ice that makes up the island fans out under the water, creating shelves ranging from 20 to 50 feet beneath the surface. Atop these shelves, lodged amid jagged spires of submerged ice, are the wrecks of several ill-fated sea galleons and ancient frost giant longships, as shown on map 5.1.

Characters who can withstand the frigid water might want to explore these sunken wrecks. For each site searched, roll a d20 and consult the Shipwreck Discoveries table to determine what the characters find. No discovery can occur more than once; if you get the same result twice, reroll or choose a different possibility.

##### Shipwreck Discoveries

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A **frost giant skeleton** (see *appendix C*) lurks in the ship's hold amid the inanimate skeletons of several other frost giants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  2  | Haunting the decks are twenty **ghouls** (the remains of the ship's human crew) that have resistance to cold damage. All the ghouls act on the same initiative count. The characters encounter four ghouls initially, with another group of four ghouls appearing each round on the ghouls' turn until all twenty show up.                                                                                |
|  3  | Two **giant sharks** swim in the ship's hold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  4  | Five **merrow** make their lair in the ship, stashed in the hold of which is a rotting sea chest that contains 400 gp, 800 sp, and four pieces of jewelry (25 gp each).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  5  | Three **sea hags** have turned the wreck into their lair. They have the Shared Spellcasting trait (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the *Monster Manual*). They keep their treasure in a rusty, barnacle-covered cauldron that's covered with a lid. The treasure consists of 2,500 sp, 4,000 cp, a 6-inch-tall merman figurine carved out of pale blue coral (250 gp), and a *potion of water breathing*. |
|  6  | An awakened **walrus** (see appendix C) with a *potion of resistance (cold)* tied around its neck greets the characters; the walrus has an Intelligence of 10, speaks Common, and allows a character to take the potion vial from around its neck. It then waves goodbye and swims away.                                                                                                                  |
|  7  | The ship's hold contains 1d6 giant oysters, each of which has a 10 percent chance of containing a *crystal ball*-sized white pearl (2,500 gp).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  8  | A giant-sized sea chest containing 2,500 gp, 5,000 sp, and a *+2 Trident* lies in the ship's hold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

![Nass Lantomir is dead, but her weasel familiar yet lives](img/adventure/IDRotF/162-05-001.weasel.webp)

#### I3. Nass Lantomir's Ghost

Nass Lantomir outsmarted her rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood by partnering with a pirate captain before leaving Luskan for Icewind Dale. After stealing **Vellynne Harpell**'s *professor orb*, Nass fled to the coast to make her rendezvous with the pirate captain's galleon, the *Wicked Eddy*. The ship found Auril's island the hard way: by crashing into the ice shelf that runs beneath it. As the vessel took on water, Nass alone swam to shore, only to die of frostbite on a snow-covered bluff overlooking the *Wicked Eddy*'s sunken hulk.

Characters who search the northwest arm of the island find Nass's frostbitten corpse and much more:

>>Half-buried in snow near the edge of a bluff is a humanoid corpse clad in cold weather clothing. Clutched in one of its hands is an orb made of smoky-gray quartz.
>>
>>A white weasel bursts from the snow near the corpse and stares at you with its beady eyes. A voice rings out. "Ye gods, I was afraid no one would find us!" The sound isn't coming from the weasel, but from the orb.
>>

If anyone tries to pry the orb from the dead wizard's fingers or otherwise disturbs the remains, **Nass Lantomir's ghost** (see appendix C) appears above the corpse and tries to possess someone on its first turn. If her ghost successfully possesses a party member, Nass tries to turn the characters against Vellynne (if she is present) and join them in their search for *The Codicil of White*. If the ghost gets what it wants, it shares the following information, some of which Nass acquired when she was alive with the aid of *spell scrolls* of *divination* used before her death:

- The Arcane Brotherhood sent four wizards to find the lost Netherese city of Ythryn, which has lain under the Reghed Glacier for nearly two thousand years. (Nass is willing to divulge the identities of the other three wizards, if asked; see the "Arcane Brotherhood" section in appendix C for details.)
- *The Codicil of White* contains a spell or ritual that can open a passage through the Reghed Glacier to the lost Netherese city.
- Worshipers of Auril have hidden *The Codicil of White* in a frost giant fortress called Grimskalle, situated atop the small mountain in the middle of the island.

The ghost can't move more than 200 feet from the place where Nass died unless it takes possession of a host. If it's forced out of a host's body when the body is more than 200 feet from where Nass died, the ghost instantly returns to that spot, regardless of whether the wizard's corpse is still there.

If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it fades away, only to reappear 24 hours later in the place where Nass died. The ghost is doomed to haunt the island until it acquires *The Codicil of White*, whereupon it achieves its final rest and ceases to exist.

***Weasel Familiar.*** The arctic **weasel** is Zelennor, Nass's fey familiar. **Vellynne Harpell** would recognize it as such. Anyone who can cast the *find familiar* spell knows that a familiar typically vanishes when its creator dies, but Zelennor has somehow formed a bond with Nass's spectral undead form. If Nass's ghost is destroyed, even temporarily, the weasel ceases to exist.

***Treasure.*** Characters who dig Nass Lantomir's corpse out of the snow find a leather satchel containing the wizard's spellbook, which is described in appendix C. Nass's other gear went down with the Wicked Eddy.

The *professor orb*, which calls itself *Professor Skant*, is happy to be found. See appendix D for a description of Professor Skant. If she is present, Vellynne tries to reclaim the orb but won't fight the characters for it. In addition to its areas of expertise, Professor Skant knows what must be done to reach the city of Ythryn, having discussed plans at length first with **Vellynne Harpell** and then with Nass Lantomir. If they part company with the orb's previous two owners, the characters can use Professor Skant to help them identify the steps they must take to reach Ythryn, if that's their goal.

#### I4. Ice Statues

There are several of these locations on the island, including one the characters will come across if they follow the brick path from the ruined dock:

>>Through the blowing snow, you see a grand assembly of ice sculptures across a snowy field at the foot of the mountain in the center of the island. Closer examination reveals that the sculptures are completely faithful to their subjects: bears, elk, saber-toothed tigers, wolves, yeti, remorhazes, white dragons, and other creatures of the North. No mortal hand could create such wondrous works.
>>

The Frostmaiden creates these ice sculptures. If the characters damage any of them, two bad things happen.

First, the Frostmaiden makes her presence known, manifesting nearby as a 7-foot-tall woman made of snow. She cries out, "Defilers!" and points a finger at them. Each character who defiled a sculpture must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to cold damage for the next 24 hours. A character who has resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Because of her weakened state, the Frostmaiden can't create another such manifestation until the next dawn.

Second, Auril telepathically awakens Korgrah, an **abominable yeti** (see area I5), and commands it to hunt down and kill the party. This yeti's sense of smell is so acute that it can track the characters by scent regardless of where they are on the island.

#### I5. Yeti Caves

Dotting the eastern slope of the ice mountain atop which Grimskalle sits are seven shallow caves, each one occupied by a hostile yeti that feeds on seals, walruses, and other island visitors. The seven **yetis** attack all at once, though a character with the Littlest Yeti secret (see *appendix B*) might attempt to communicate with them in hopes of improving their attitude.

If all seven yetis are slain, their angry spirits awaken Korgrah, an **abominable yeti** that slumbers under the ice and snow, unless Korgrah has already been killed. The abominable yeti explodes from an ice-covered cyst lets out a howl that can be heard across the island, and hunts the characters until it or they are dead. This fearsome yeti can't be mollified by a character with the Littlest Yeti secret.

***Inside the Caves.*** Each yeti cave contains the bones of the yetis' past meals, but no treasure.

#### I6. Garden of Death

>>A ten-foot-tall wall of ice has broken down in a few places, leaving gaps through which you can see what appears to be a huge garden of ice sculptures.
>>

This area is a graveyard where Auril displays creatures that have died on the island from the extreme cold. Each creature is encased in a thick coat of ice, preserving its remains. Amid scores of humanoid cadaversÃ¢ÂÂpirates, hunters, adventurers, worshipers, and others who fell prey to Auril's cold embraceÃ¢ÂÂare the frozen forms of hares, foxes, and other small animals.

An **ice troll** (see *appendix C*) found its way here and destroyed parts of the outer wall. It has also been gnawing on some of the corpses. Auril isn't concerned about the intrusion, since this place is much less important to her than her ice statues are. If the characters loiter in the garden, the ice troll attacks and fights to the death.

**Vellynne Harpell** and Nass Lantomir are both aware of the magical properties of ice troll hearts (as described in the "**Ice Troll**" entry in appendix C) and can share this information with the characters once the ice troll is killed.

![The Frostmaiden sculpts ice into fantastic shapes](img/adventure/IDRotF/163-05-002.sculptures.webp)

## Grimskalle

When the characters are in a position to see this location from the south, describe it as follows:

>>Rising before you is a six-hundred-foot-tall mountain of glacial ice, its peak carved to resemble a gigantic skull wearing a crown. Weaving up the mountain's southern slope are enormous stairs hewn from the ice. These steps, which extend from the base of the mountain to the base of the fortress, were clearly made for giants.
>>

Grimskalle was constructed for a frost giant queen named Vassavicken and is filled with the remnants of her reign, including her corpse. Auril has claimed the stronghold to serve her own worldly needs.

The Frostmaiden has sequestered herself inside, though she does vacate the place once a day. Shortly before midnight, she mounts the roc that sleeps on the rooftop (area G9) and takes to the sky to weave her nightly spell. She is gone for several hours, during which time the characters can explore Grimskalle without fear of running into her.

***Ice Steps.*** Each step is 4 feet higher than the one below it, making the staircase difficult terrain for creatures that aren't Huge giants. The snow and rime covering the steps make them less slippery than they would be otherwise.

### Fortress Features

The following features are common throughout the fortress:

- **Giant-Sized.** Furnishings, passageways, and the dimensions of the rooms inside are all sized for frost giants and other Huge creatures. The same is true of some accessory items, including treasure, as noted in the text.
- **Ice and Mist.** All surfaces (floors, ceilings, walls, and so forth) are made of smooth, opaque, chiseled ice with a bluish tinge. A 2-foot-deep blanket of cold mist creeps across the floors, which aren't slippery unless the text states otherwise.

**Darkness**. The fortress is not illuminated. Frost giants lit their way with torches, the ancient stubs of which litter the floors. The current occupants rely on darkvision to see. Area descriptions assume that the characters have a light source or some other means of seeing in the dark.

***Doors.*** A door is a 25-foot-high, 8-foot-wide, 2ÃÂ½-foot-thick slab of chiseled ice with crude handles. In place of hinges, a door has thick, cylindrical pins of ice that rest in holes at the top and bottom edges of the door's frame. A creature can use an action to try to push open one of these doors, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A door is a Huge object with AC 13, hp 60, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings throughout are 30 feet high.

>>The steps end in front of a double door made from slabs of ice with dragon skulls and bones embedded in them. Carved into the lintel is a single word in the Dwarvish script.
>>

The skulls and bones embedded in the doors belong to several young white dragons. Giants use the Dwarvish script as their written language, and the Dwarvish word carved above the doors translates to "Grimskalle."

#### G2. Guard Room

>>This long, rectangular room is strewn with pieces of rotting wood and rusted metalÃ¢ÂÂthe remnants of giant weapons and weapon racks. A rusted-out helmet sized for a giant lies near the back wall.
>>

Nothing in this room is salvageable.

#### G3. Frost Giant Warden

>>A withered old frost giant leaning heavily on a greataxe sits in front of a tall door in the far wall. The giant wooden stool upon which he sits creaks under his weight as he stares at you with cloudy eyes.
>>

The **frost giant** is named Ertgard. Because of old age, his walking speed is 20 feet. He is also deaf, can't see farther than 20 feet, and can't take reactions. The characters must move at least 10 feet into the room before Ertgard notices them, whereupon he grips his weapon tightly, stumbles to his feet, and says (in Giant), "Death, we meet at last!"

Ertgard is the last surviving member of Vassavicken's clan and is eager to die honorably. Although he has sworn fealty to Auril, he isn't of much use to her and doesn't have any responsibilities other than to guard the fortress as best he can. If he's knocked unconscious, revived, and interrogated, Ertgard offers the following information (in Giant) if the characters promise him an honorable, swift, and merciful death:

- Every night, the Frostmaiden leaves Grimskalle on the back of Iskra, her roc, to cast a spell that holds the next day's sun at bay. Otherwise, she resides upstairs (on the palace level).
- Auril is sometimes attended by frost druids, although no druids are present at this time. The frost druids who last visited her left behind an intelligent giant walrus named Ukuma. It dwells downstairs (on the dungeon level).
- *The Codicil of White* is sealed in a vault downstairs (on the dungeon level). Only one who passes Auril's four testsÃ¢ÂÂthe Tests of Cruelty, Endurance, Isolation, and PreservationÃ¢ÂÂcan open the vault (see area G15).

***Treasure.*** The small room behind Ertgard contains all the treasure he was able to gather from inside the fortress, heaped in a pile on the floor:

- 1,350 gp, 4,400 sp, and 7,800 cp
- Four gold rings sized for giants (150 gp each)
- A giant-sized shield made of white dragon scales (impressive but worthless)
- A 2-foot-tall, 50-pound, chipped statuette of Thrym (the evil frost giant god) made of ice that doesn't melt (50 gp)
- An *alchemy jug*

#### G4. Ruined Kitchen

>>Frost covers a bloated trestle table that stands amid rotting barrels and casks in the middle of what used to be a kitchen. Storage racks along the walls have collapsed into piles of rotted timber along with the jugs, tankards, and drinking horns that once rested on them. A roasting spit lined with icicles is mounted above a ten-foot-diameter iron brazier coated with rime and situated near the back wall.
>>

The barrels and casks are empty and fall apart easily. The jugs, tankards, and drinking horns are all cracked or otherwise damaged. Nothing of value remains here.

#### G5. Feast Hall

Shattered chunks of ice, the remains of a door, lie strewn on the floor around the opening, allowing characters to see into the room beyond without obstruction.

>>In the middle of this immense hall stands a thirty-foot-long, ten-foot-wide, ten-foot-high dining table carved from ice and surrounded by a dozen blocks of ice that once served as chairs. Wooden braces against the west wall hold a pair of fourteen-foot-long bugles made from hollowed-out mammoth tusks. An ascending staircase of ice in the southwest corner has mist rolling down it.
>>

One of the mammoth tusk bugles is intact, but the other one is cracked and no longer works. These bugles were used to summon frost giants for dinner or to sound an alarm.

***Stairs Up.*** The stairs climb 90 feet to area G7.

#### G6. Perched Mephits

As in area G5, shattered chunks of ice, the remains of a door, lie on the floor around the opening where the door once stood, allowing characters to see into the room beyond without obstruction.

>>Six slender, gargoyle-like creatures made of ice squat on ledges twenty feet above the ground that protrude from the wall of this semicircular chamber. Near the back wall, the mist that blankets the floor flows down a staircase made of polished ice.
>>

The creatures perched on the ledges are six **ice mephits** created by Auril. They observe intruders quietly. If any of them are threatened or harmed, they all attack. Otherwise, the mephits take no aggressive action without a command from their creator.

***Stairs Down.*** The stairs, which descend 90 feet to area G10, are slippery. The slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves on these stairs for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature also tumbles 10 feet down the stairs and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

#### G7. Throne Room

>>This semicircular room has a forest of icicles hanging from its ceiling, some of them as much as eight feet long. Against the curved wall to the south stands an enormous throne of ice decorated with carved images of winter wolves and mastodons. Across from the throne on the north wall is an open doorway.
>>

The throne belonged to Vassavicken, the frost giant queen who originally occupied Grimskalle.

Auril has transformed seven of the icicles that cling to the ceiling into creatures that resemble piercers. They use the **piercer** stat block, have immunity to cold damage, and deal 10 (3d6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage on a hit.

***Stairs Down.*** The stairs in the northwest corner of this room descend 90 feet to area G5.

### Grimskalle Locations (G8-G14)

#### G8. Queen's Bedchamber

Auril uses this space as her personal sanctuary. Depending on how this encounter plays out, you might need to reference one or more of Auril's stat blocks in  *appendix C*.

>>This room contains wrecked furnishings that suggest it was once used as a frost giant's bedchamber. A bitterly cold wind blows down a staircase to the east, at the bottom of which snow has accumulated.
>>

Unless she has left the fortress to cast her nightly spell over Icewind Dale, the Frostmaiden lurks here in her first form, living in fear that her divine enemies will find and destroy her. She normally occupies the room to the west but lurches toward the larger room to greet the characters as they arrive. The characters have no chance of surprising her.

It takes almost all of the Frostmaiden's divine power to keep the sun from rising over Icewind Dale, and she doesn't abide the presence of mortals other than her most ardent worshipers. Consequently, Auril does her utmost to slay intruders or, at least, terrify them into fleeing her island and never returning. In addition to the powers given in her three stat blocks, she can use the lair actions described in appendix C.

Destroying one of Auril's forms is challenging enough. Destroying all three of her forms in sequence should be a severe test for even the most determined and well-equipped party of adventurers. You can make Auril even tougher by having her use a lair action to teleport to the rooftop (area G9), where her roc can fight alongside her.

A fight against Auril continues until the characters defeat her or retreat. Both options are discussed below:

- If the characters destroy all three of Auril's forms, any character who has the Midwinter Child secret (see *appendix B*) loses the benefit of that secret until the Frostmaiden is reborn at the next winter solstice. In addition, Auril's demise causes the uppermost levels of the fortress to collapse, as described in the "Fall of Grimskalle" section at the end of this chapter.
- If the characters flee, Auril lets them go so that they can spread horrific tales of their encounter with her, thus discouraging others from visiting her island. After finishing a long rest, Auril gets back all her forms.

The Frostmaiden has no need for worldly possessions and keeps nothing of value in this room.

***Stairs Up.*** The curved staircase climbs 90 feet to area G9.

#### G9. Crowned Rooftop

>>The icy crown encircling the fortress doubles as a battlemented rooftop. Each prong of the crown extends forty feet above the roofline, and the prongs have 10-foot-wide gaps between them. Situated in the middle of the roof is a nest almost thirty feet in diameter.
>>

If Auril is home, so is her white **roc**, Iskra. During the day, the roc sleeps in its nest. Shortly before midnight, the roc takes to the sky with the Frostmaiden on its back and doesn't return to the fortress until a few hours before sunrise. Without the roc to carry her around Icewind Dale, Auril can't cast her nightly spell, thus bringing an end to the everlasting winter.

The roc is too big to enter the fortress. If it takes damage from foes it can't reach, it gets clear of the fortress and climbs to a height that puts it outside the range of its enemies. If the roc grapples a foe, it heads toward open water with its prize; once there, it drops the grappled creature into the water from a height of at least 200 feet. In addition to taking 20d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, the victim must also contend with the frigid water (see "Frigid Water").

***Treasure.*** A thorough search of the roc's nest yields the following treasures:

- A 5-foot-tall, 150-pound silvery dragon egg that will hatch in 3d10 days, giving birth to a **silver dragon wyrmling**
- A carved harp of exotic wood with ivory inlay and zircon gemstones (750 gp)
- An electrum chain with a bloodstone pendant (250 gp)
- A wooden sea chest covered with bird droppings and sealed with a heavy padlock that a character using thieves' tools can pick with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check; inside the chest are 320 gp, a gold ring with a black pearl set into a fixture shaped like a whirlpool (750 gp), and a *spell scroll* of *mass cure wounds*

#### G10. Ice Rink

>>The staircase descends into a vaulted chamber. A nine-foot-high railing of sculpted ice hugs the staircase as it descends to the chamber floor, which, like the stairs, is smooth and gleaming. A walrus as big as an elephant is having a grand old time rolling and sliding on the ice, paying you little heed.
>>

The **giant walrus** (see *appendix C*), named Ukuma, is supposed to be guarding this room. A frost druid's *awaken* spell has given it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common. Although it's grateful for the magical gift, the giant walrus is not interested in serving anyone or attending to guard duty. It would rather roll around on the ice and engage in light conversation with new arrivals. Characters can befriend Ukuma by tossing it a fish or some other tasty morsel.

Ukuma knows the following information, which it's happy to share with characters who befriend it:

- The tunnel to the north ends before the tomb of a frost giant queen, who died before the Frostmaiden took control of the island.
- The tunnel to the south leads to a vault where servants of the Frostmaiden store the treasures of their faith.
- To enter the vault, one must pass four tests. Each test reflects an aspect of the Frostmaiden: cruelty, endurance, isolation, and preservation. The tests lie beyond the four doors that lead away from the room.

Narrow archways to the west and east lead to a pair of small chambers. Frost druids and other worshipers of Auril use these rooms as sleeping quarters, though no one is present when the characters arrive.

***Rink.*** The floor in this area is as smooth as an ice rink. When a creature moves on the floor for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. The giant walrus doesn't need to make this check.

***Stairs Up.*** From the ceiling to the floor, the stairs that lead up to area G6 are enclosed by thick, 9-foot-high railings of sculpted ice. The stairs, like the floor, are difficult terrain. When a creature moves on these stairs for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature also tumbles 10 feet down the stairs and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

#### G11. Tomb Entrance

>>The passageway leads to an anvil-shaped room with a door set into the far wall. Flanking the door are bas-reliefs of two female frost giants holding greataxes. Runes are carved into the door's surface.
>>

The runes on the door, written in the Dwarvish script, read as follows:

>In ice and blood, our folk are born.
>
>To our great queen, we raise our horn.
>
>We'll fight and plunder in the morn.
>
>To Vassavicken, we are sworn.
>

#### G12. Skeletal Guards

>>This chamber has another door set into the far wall. Standing on either side of the door is a frost giant skeleton wielding a rusty anchor. The pinpricks of light in their eye sockets brighten as they register your presence.
>>

The weapons of these two **frost giant skeletons** deal bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage. They otherwise use the stat block in *appendix C*. They attack any creatures they see and pursue fleeing prey into G11 but no farther.

![Frost giant skeletons guard the way to Queen Vassavicken's frozen tomb](img/adventure/IDRotF/166-05-003.skeletons.webp)

#### G13. Vassavicken's Tomb

>>This chamber contains a dead female frost giant encased in a solid block of ice carved to resemble a standing sarcophagus. The block of ice is twenty-five feet tall, twelve feet wide, and ten feet thick. Behind the entombed giant, embedded in the north wall, is a door made of ice.
>>
>>The ceiling is carved in the scowling visage of a male frost giant with an icy beard.
>>

The frost giant entombed in the block of ice is Queen Vassavicken. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) guess correctly that the visage looking down on the queen is a representation of Thrym, the evil god of frost giants.

***Trap.*** A character can reach Vassavicken's corpse by chipping away the ice that encases her, but Thrym will not stand for such an act of defilement. If enough ice is chipped away or melted to expose any portion of Vassavicken's corpse to the air, Thrym's visage opens its mouth and breathes a cloud of magical cold energy that fills the entire room, sealing Vassavicken's corpse in ice once more. Any creature in the room when Thrym breathes must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Thrym's visage is impervious to damage from spells and weapons.

***Door to Area G14.*** This door is stuck. A creature can use an action to try to pull open the door, doing so with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### G14. Vassavicken's Axe

>>Leaning against the back wall of this room is a formidable weapon: a giant-sized greataxe, its steel head resting on the icy floor.
>>

***Treasure.*** The greataxe is Vassavicken's *berserker axe*, which adjusts in size to match whoever attunes to it. When found, it's 15 feet tall and weighs 650 pounds. If a character attunes to the axe, it shrinks to a size befitting its new wielder.

### Grimskalle Locations (G15-G23)

#### G15. Tests of the Frostmaiden

The first time the characters enter one of these chambers, read:

>>The walls of this oddly shaped room are etched with elaborate panoramas of winter scenes. Set into the back wall is a door inscribed with a large snowflake. A single word is carved into the lintel above it.
>>

Characters who succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check correctly surmise that the snowflake inscribed on the door is the Frostmaiden's holy symbol. The word carved above the door depends on which area lies on the other side:

- **Door to Area G16.** Carved into the lintel above this door is the word "Cruelty" in Common.
- **Door to Area G17.** Part of the lintel has broken off, but characters can still make out the word "Endurance" carved into it in Common.
- **Door to Area G18.** Carved into the lintel above this door is the word "Isolation" in Common.
- **Door to Area G19.** The lintel above this door has partially broken off, destroying some of the inscription carved into it. What's left reads "Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂervation" in Common.

There are four Tests of the Frostmaiden: the Test of Cruelty in area G16, the Test of Endurance in area G17, the Test of Isolation in area G18, and the Test of Preservation in area G19.

Each test begins by opening a door marked with the symbol of Auril. When that happens, all the participants in the test are teleported to the location where the test takes place. If **Vellynne Harpell** is with the party, she is willing to participate in the tests and counts as a party member if the characters allow her to accompany them.

When a test ends, use the Tests of the Frostmaiden Scorecard to keep track of which party members passed the test by putting a checkmark to the right of each of their names in the appropriate column. This scorecard will help you determine whether the vault door in area G20 can be opened or not. It is strictly a tool for DM record-keeping and not meant to be shared with the players. Permission is granted to photocopy this scorecard for home game use.

The tests can be taken in any order. Each party member can take a particular test only once; a party member who tries to take a test a second time is not teleported.

#### Tests of the Frostmaiden Scorecard

![Scorecard table with the following column titles: Party Memeber | Test of Cruelty | Test of Endurance | Test of Isolation | Test of Preservation](img/adventure/IDRotF/167-05-004.scorecard.webp)

#### G16. Test of Cruelty

Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone in the nearest room marked G15 on the map to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a Reghed camp in the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

>>Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself standing at the edge of a camp, its tents holding fast against a raging blizzard.
>>

The blizzard rages for the duration of the test and is inescapable.

This camp is home to the King of the Bear Tribe, **Gunvald Halraggson** (see appendix C). If Gunvald died earlier in the adventure, replace him with another Bear Tribe chieftain named Svilbrekhild Forennal (a female human **gladiator** in hide armor who speaks Common and has Survival +5). See "Reghed Tribe Camp" for a map and a general description of the campsite. There are no sled dogs at this camp.

The characters are not dreaming; the Frostmaiden's magic has teleported them from Grimskalle to this camp. Each party member has a tiny, glowing, snowflake floating a few inches above themÃ¢ÂÂthe symbol of the Frostmaiden, which most Reghed nomads recognize and fear. Members of the Bear Tribe won't attack anyone bearing this symbol except in self-defense.

***The Test Begins.*** The camp has run out of food, and the tribe's hunters have failed to return because of the unyielding blizzard. The nomads have already eaten their sled dogs. Now, Gunvald has decided that desperate times require desperate measures. He plans to kill four of the tribe's eldest members and cook them to feed the rest of the camp. His evil shaman has convinced him to take this drastic course of action.

Once the characters' presence becomes known, they are brought before King Gunvald. He treats them with respect and caution, as befits emissaries of the Frostmaiden. He has the four elders lined up outside his tent and entreats the characters to kill them or leave the camp at once.

To pass the Test of Cruelty, a character must perform a cruel act, such as slaying the defenseless elders as King Gunvald commands. The characters can also pass the test by walking away from the camp and leaving the starving nomads at the mercy of their mad kingÃ¢ÂÂa cruel act in the eyes of the Frostmaiden. If the characters defy King Gunvald, he kills the defenseless elders himself.

Characters can fail the test by not engaging in acts of cruelty, such as by refusing to kill the elders, defending them, or doing nothing whatsoever.

***The Test Ends.*** After 1 hour, everyone with a symbol of Auril hovering above their head is teleported back to Grimskalle, appearing in the room marked G16 on the map.

#### G17. Test of Endurance

Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone in the nearest room marked G15 on the map to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a Reghed camp in the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

>>Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself in a raging snowstorm, standing at the edge of a Reghed tribe's camp in the process of being dismantled. The nomads work feverishly to tear down their tents and pack them onto dogsleds. A few of them spot you and brandish their weapons. A tall figure standing among them calls out, "We shall not lie down and die for your pleasure, emissaries of Auril! Begone, vultures!"
>>

This camp is home to the King of the Elk Tribe, **Jarund Elkhardt** (see appendix C). If Jarund died earlier in the adventure, replace him with **Hengar Aesnvaard**, a Common-speaking **gladiator** with Survival +5. See "Reghed Tribe Camp" for a map and a general description of the campsite.

The characters are not dreaming; the Frostmaiden's magic has teleported them from Grimskalle to this camp. Each party member has a tiny, glowing snowflake floating a few inches above themÃ¢ÂÂthe symbol of the Frostmaiden, which most Reghed nomads recognize and fear. Members of the Elk Tribe won't attack anyone bearing this symbol except in self-defense.

***The Test Begins.*** The figure calling out to the characters is King Jarund, who has ordered that the camp be torn down so that the nomads can stay close to the **reindeer** herd they've been following. The herd is migrating eastward, and where go the **reindeer**, so goes the Elk Tribe. If the characters assure Jarund that they mean no harm, he gives them a choice: help or leave. Either way, he doesn't want to provoke Auril's wrath.

The party members don't need to help the nomads tear down the camp or set up a new one, but they must accompany the nomads on their journey and endure the same hardship. The trip is a grueling march across the tundra with the wind against them the whole time. There's no chance of a party member becoming lost in this blizzard, which has an unusual property: magic does not function within it, as though the area encompassed by the blizzard is within an antimagic field (as described in the *antimagic field* spell description in the *Player's Handbook*).

The march lasts 14 hours. Party members can weather the first 8 hours. At the end of every hour after that, each must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 10 plus 1 for each additional hour that passes (DC 11 at the end of the ninth hour, DC 12 at the end of the tenth hour, and so on). On a failed saving throw, a character gains one level of exhaustion. Any party member who completes the journey with four or fewer levels of exhaustion passes the Test of Endurance.

At the end of the forced march, King Jarund orders the tribe to pitch tents and start campfires.

***The Test Ends.*** Once the Elk Tribe camp is set up in its new location, everyone with a glowing symbol of Auril hovering above their head is teleported back to Grimskalle, appearing in the room marked G17 on the map.

#### G18. Test of Isolation

Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone in the nearest room marked G15 on the map to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a Reghed camp in the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

>>Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself standing at the edge of a camp under a clear sky. All the warriors in camp appear to be sharpening their weapons.
>>

This camp is home to the Queen of the Tiger Tribe, **Bjornhild Solvigsdottir** (see appendix C). If Bjornhild died earlier in the adventure, replace her with another Tiger Tribe chieftain named Valtus D'karna (a male human **gladiator** in hide armor who speaks Common and has Survival +5). See "Reghed Tribe Camp" for a map and a general description of the campsite.

The characters are not dreaming; the Frostmaiden's magic has teleported them from Grimskalle to this camp. Each party member has a tiny, glowing snowflake floating a few inches above themÃ¢ÂÂthe symbol of the Frostmaiden, which most Reghed nomads recognize and fear. Members of the Tiger Tribe won't attack anyone bearing this symbol except in self-defense.

***The Test Begins.*** If the characters enter the camp, Tiger Tribe warriors escort them to Queen Bjornhild, who is using a stone to sharpen the edges of her greataxe while her **saber-toothed tiger**, Grava, keeps a steady eye on the new arrivals. Bjornhild's reaction to the characters is one of exultation, which is not surprising given her devotion to the Frostmaiden:

>>"Auril has blessed us!" she shouts to every other warrior in earshot. "The Frostmaiden has sent emissaries to watch our camp while we complete our mission!"
>>

If the characters ask Bjornhild to elaborate, she tells them that she's planning to attack a nearby Elk Tribe camp and steal their food. She's taking every member of her camp with her, hoping that overwhelming numbers will make the unsuspecting Elk tribesfolk give up without a fight. She asks the characters to stay behind and watch over her camp until she returns. Bjornhild expects to be back in a day or two, although fate has other plans.

If one of the characters has the Reghed Heir secret (see *appendix B*), now is a good time to deal with that. It could certainly complicate matters, depending on how the character chooses to interact with Bjornhild.

The obvious course of action the characters can take is to wait until Bjornhild returns from her raid. As it turns out, the raid is more successful than anticipated; after overwhelming and routing the enemy, Bjornhild decides to take over their camp and wait for Elk hunting parties to return so she can slaughter them and take their food as well. As a result, the characters are alone at Bjornhild's camp for six days and nights.

Allow the players to describe what their characters do during this period of time. After every 24 hours spent guarding the camp and ensuring their own survival, all party members in the camp must make a Wisdom (Survival) group check. The DC of the group check is 10 + 2 for each day after the first. Each time the group check fails, the party member who rolled the lowest goes missing.

When you explain what has just happened, tell the player of the missing character that they have been transported elsewhere and have no awareness of their surroundings. Tell the other players that none of the remaining party members have any idea where the missing party member went, and their memories of the past 24 hours are cloudy at best. Even if the party members take precautions on later days to avoid being separated, such as tying themselves together with rope, they discover that (if their group check fails) another one of their number goes absent. The disappearances continue until the Tiger nomads come back or until there is only one character left in the camp.

After six days and nights, Bjornhild and the surviving members of her camp return with several haunches of **reindeer** meat loaded on dogsleds. Accompanying them are all the party members who went missing from the camp; the Tiger nomads found them, one by one, wandering in a daze. Each of these party members must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or return to camp with a form of indefinite madness determined by rolling on the Indefinite Madness table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

All party members who vanished from the camp during the Tiger nomads' absence pass the Test of Isolation, as do party members who are still at the camp when the nomads return. Characters fail the Test of Isolation by dying or by preventing Bjornhild from launching her raid.

***Slaad Host.*** If a character has the Slaad Host secret (see *appendix B*) and hasn't already gotten rid of the **slaad tadpole** gestating inside them, having the tadpole burst out of the character's chest at some point during this test would be a surprising development.

***The Test Ends.*** After the Tiger nomads return to their camp triumphant, everyone with a glowing symbol of Auril hovering above their head is teleported back to Grimskalle, appearing in the room marked G18 on the map.

#### G19. Test of Preservation

Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone in the rooms marked G15 on the map to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a Reghed camp in the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:

>>Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself at the edge of a camp under clear skies. All the fires in the camp are out, and the only sound you hear is the flapping of the tents as the wind hits them.
>>
>>Closer examination reveals dozens of corpses half-buried in snowdrifts. It becomes clear that a massacre took place here recently. You hear the squawking of buzzards coming from the middle of the camp and see a half dozen vultures picking at two bodies outside one of the larger tents.
>>

![Aerix Vokototh](img/adventure/IDRotF/168-05-005.aerix.webp)

This camp was home to the chieftain of a clan who stood in the way of **Isarr Kronenstrom**'s rise to becoming king of the Wolf Tribe. See "Reghed Tribe Camp" for a map and a general description of the campsite. There are no dogs or dogsleds at this camp, since they were stolen by the camp's attackers.

The characters are not dreaming; the Frostmaiden's magic has teleported them from Grimskalle to this camp. Each party member has a tiny, glowing snowflake floating a few inches above themÃ¢ÂÂthe symbol of the Frostmaiden.

***The Test Begins.*** All but one of the Reghed nomads in the camp have been killed by Wolf Tribe members loyal to **Isarr Kronenstrom**. The sole survivor is the nine-year-old son of the clan's chieftain, a noncombatant named Aerix Vokototh who stayed alive by hiding in the snow. Aerix has AC 10 and 3 hit points. He was born on the Midwinter holiday and as such is blessed by Auril with resistance to cold damage. He wears only a light woolen poncho, as extremely cold weather doesn't bother him. When the characters arrive, Aerix is cowering in the chieftain's tent while six **giant vultures** feast on the corpses of his mother (the chieftain) and father (the camp's shaman). If the characters kill two or more vultures, the others take to the sky and circle above the camp for the remainder of the test.

After dealing with the vultures, the characters hear low sobs coming from one of the big tents and find Aerix inside. The boy is in a terrible state of shock and refuses to speak, although a *calm emotions* spell or similar magic enables him to describe the massacre to which he bore witness. As Aerix begins to recount what happened, **Isarr Kronenstrom** (see appendix C) appears at the edge of the camp, having found out that the marauders he sent to kill the camp's chieftain failed to find and kill her son as well. Isarr is determined to slay the child himself.

Isarr circles the camp, letting out a terrible howl every minute or two. Aerix urges the characters to hide from the Wolf King, lest he flay them to pieces.

If he is not confronted, Isarr starts searching the camp's outer circle of tents, taking about 1 minute to examine each one. In the course of this task, Isarr might stumble upon tracks left by the characters but continues his search of the outer tents, then does the same thing with the inner ring of tents, saving the chieftain's tent for last. By this time, if the characters haven't already engaged him, Isarr knows they're around and is looking forward to killing them as well and leaving their corpses as tribute to Malar the Beast Lord. If the characters attack Isarr, any **giant vultures** circling overhead join the fight as Isarr's allies.

To pass the Test of Preservation, the party members must keep Aerix alive so that his family's bloodline is preserved. Killing Isarr before he kills Aerix is the only way to accomplish this goal. If the characters try to sneak Aerix out of the camp, Isarr follows their tracks and pursues the boy relentlessly.

***The Test Ends.*** If Aerix dies, no one passes the test, and everyone with a glowing symbol of Auril hovering above their head is teleported back to Grimskalle, appearing in the room marked G19 on the map.

If Aerix is saved, an awakened **wolf** lopes toward him in a nonthreatening manner. This wolf has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common. It offers to bear Aerix safely to another Wolf Tribe camp. Aerix is inclined to trust the wolf and accompany it. Whether the characters surrender Aerix to the wolf or not is up to them, but once their decision is made, everyone with a glowing symbol of Auril hovering above their head is teleported back to Grimskalle, appearing in the room marked G19 on the map. Aerix and the wolf are left behind.

#### G20. Entrance to the Vault

>>The passage leads to an anvil-shaped room with a door set into the far wall. Flanking the door are bas-reliefs of two male frost giants that have been defaced, their features chipped away. Newer carvings above the door depict the glowering heads of an owl, a wolf, and a goat.
>>

The heads carved above the door represent Auril's first form (see  *appendix C*). If anyone enters the room, add:

>>A disembodied voice says, "This way is shut to all but those who pass the tests of cruelty, endurance, isolation, and preservation."
>>

Whenever one or more characters enter this area, use the Tests of the Frostmaiden scorecard to help you remember who among them passed the Frostmaiden's tests (areas G16 through G19). The door to area G21 swings open on its own if each of the four tests was passed by at least one individual in the room. For example, an individual that passed all four tests can open the door by entering the room, as can four individuals that each passed a different test. The door is otherwise unopenable, indestructible, and impassable. Any spell cast with the intent of bypassing the door fails and is wasted.

***Worshipers of Auril.*** If the characters failed enough of the Frostmaiden's tests to make it impossible for them to open the door, all hope of breaching the vault is not lost. You can have fate smile upon them with the arrival of three **frost druids** (see *appendix C*) who have visited the island previously and have already passed their own variations of the Frostmaiden's tests. These druids have the *darkvision* spell prepared instead of *animal messenger*. They flew to Grimskalle in owl form and entered the fortress in human form, using their *darkvision* spells to see in the dark. The druids' names are Faash, Gildreban, and Siovakis.

The druids have returned to the island because they intend to read *The Codicil of White* (see area G22) and draw inspiration from it. If one or more of them are allowed into area G20, the door to area G21 swings open on its own. If the druids reach area G22 and are aware of the characters' presence, the druids seize *The Codicil of White* and try to escape with it, to keep it from falling into the hands of Auril's enemies.

In combat, the druids like to pelt enemies with *ice storm* spells or use their *conjure animals* spells to summon **polar bears** (one bear per casting of the spell). The polar bears act on their own initiative count and fight alongside their summoners.

#### G21. Hall of the Four Winds

>>Arranged about this room are three tablets of ice, each ten feet tall, seven feet wide, and one foot thick. They sit upright in stands that are also carved from ice. Script has been chiseled into the surface of each tablet. Another door stands in the middle of the far wall.
>>

The inscriptions on the four ice tablets, in Common, spell out the tenets of Auril's faith:

- **Cruelty.** "Compassion makes you vulnerable. Let cruelty be the knife that keeps your enemies at bay."
- **Endurance.** "Exist as long as you can, by whatever means you can. Only by enduring can you outlast your enemies."
- **Isolation.** "In solitude you can understand and harness your full potential. Depending on others makes you weak."
- **Preservation.** "Every flake of snow is unique, and that which is unique must be preserved."

Each tablet is a Large object with AC 13, 25 hit points, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. With a successful DC 15 Strength check, a character can knock a tablet off its stand, causing it to shatter on the floor. Reducing a tablet to 0 hit points also shatters it. Shattering a tablet releases a hostile spirit of elemental air (use the **invisible stalker** stat block) bound inside it. This spirit tries to kill whoever released it. The spirit disappears if it succeeds or if it's reduced to 0 hit points.

#### G22. Chamber of the Codicil

>>This chamber has a domed ceiling engraved with a giant snowflake. Two caryatids depicting a towering woman stand on either side of a door in the south wall. In the middle of the room is a five-foot-tall, claw-shaped lectern with a white-covered book resting on it.
>>

The caryatids flanking the south doorway depict Auril in her second form (see  *appendix C*). Both are harmless carvings but noticeably cold to the touch.

***Treasure.*** The book on the lectern is *The Codicil of White* (see *appendix D*). No wards or creatures are guarding it. If she's still with the party, **Vellynne Harpell** is eager to claim the book, if only to add the *frost fingers* spell (see *appendix D*) to her spellbook. If it's present in a host body, **Nass Lantomir's ghost** is laid to rest as soon as its host picks up or grasps the book.

A character who spends at least 10 minutes poring over *The Codicil of White* learns that the poem in its pages, "Rime of the Frostmaiden" (see *appendix E*), is an incantation that can be used to unlock Auril's secrets, including ones buried deep under the glacial ice. This, Vellynne says, is exactly what the characters need to reach the lost city of Ythryn under the Reghed Glacier. Once the characters have the poem or a transcription of it, they don't need the rest of the book.

![Mounted on her roc, the Frostmaiden takes to the sky to cast her nightly spell](img/adventure/IDRotF/169-05-006.frostmaiden-mounted.webp)

#### G23. Auril's Blessing

>>Beyond the door is a small room filled with mist. Chunks of broken ice cover the floor.
>>

Characters who examine the broken ice on the floor can see that they are fragments of three lifelike human ice sculpturesÃ¢ÂÂthe remains of unworthy devotees who failed to receive Auril's blessing (see below).

***Auril's Blessing.*** If she's alive, Auril becomes aware of any creature that enters this room. If a character who has the Midwinter Child secret (see *appendix B*) or a character who passed all four of Auril's tests enters the room, the Frostmaiden contacts the character telepathically and asks, "Will you court death to receive my blessing?" She makes this offer to a character once only. A character who agrees to receive Auril's blessing must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character is petrified, becoming an ice statue instead of a stone one. On a successful save, the character gains the blessing of the Frostmaiden, which Auril can rescind at any time while she's alive. This blessing otherwise adheres to the rules for blessings as described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

***Blessing of the Frostmaiden.*** Your eyes become as cold as ice. You gain immunity to cold damage. In addition, you can cast the *cone of cold* spell (save DC 15) once. You regain the ability to cast this spell when you finish a long rest.

## Wrapping Up

The following sections describe what is sure to happen if the characters defeat Auril.

### Fall of Grimskalle

When her final form is reduced to 0 hit points, Auril emits a death-howl that causes the two uppermost floors of Grimskalle (the battlement level and the palace level, as shown on map 5.2) to crack and begin to collapse. Creatures have 1 minute to escape these levels of the fortress before they are crushed to death by icy rubble. Grimskalle's entry level (areas G1 through G6) and dungeon level (areas G10 through G23) remain intact and accessible after the collapse.

### Ending the Everlasting Rime

Destroying all three of Auril's forms or slaying the roc allows the sun to once more climb above the mountains. It takes a while for Icewind Dale to return to its natural climate, but life becomes a bit easier as the frigid temperatures rise to a bearable cold.

If she survives but her roc is killed, Auril broods in her fortress, unaccustomed to being thwarted by mortals. Since she is ageless and time is on her side, she sets about finding another roc that she can raise from a hatchling to serve her. Years, decades, or centuries might pass before she's ready to cast her spell over Icewind Dale again.

# Chapter 6: Caves of Hunger

After opening a fissure in the Reghed Glacier, a party of explorers prepares to head inside.

Equipped with the "Rime of the Frostmaiden," the characters can begin their search for the lost Netherese city buried deep in the Reghed Glacier. Ideally, the characters should be at least 8th level when they embark on this journey. Lower-level characters can survive the Caves of Hunger if they're cautious and rest often to regain their spent hit points and magic.

The characters must use the "Rime of the Frostmaiden" to open a crack in the glacial wall at a place where a waterfall once tumbled down the glacier. The newly formed passage leads to the Caves of Hunger, a dungeon that was sealed off by the Frostmaiden long agoÃ¢ÂÂa network of sepulchral ice caves haunted by ravenous beings. These chambers must be successfully navigated to reach the Netherese city of Ythryn.

![After opening a fissure in the Reghed Glacier, a party of explorers prepares to head inside](img/adventure/IDRotF/170-06-000.intro-splash.webp)

## Running This Chapter

This chapter focuses on the characters' exploration of the ice caves. There's a good chance that **Vellynne Harpell** is present as well, serving as an NPC guide. If she died earlier in the adventure, the characters can use *Professor Skant* as a substitute guide, assuming they retrieved Vellynne's *professor orb* from Auril's island in chapter 5. If neither Vellynne nor Professor Skant are around, you can furnish another NPC with the information needed to reach the Caves of Hunger. Likely candidates include **Hengar Aesnvaard** (see "Elk Tribe Escort" below) and **Dzaan's simulacrum** (see *appendix C*).

### Character Advancement

The characters should gain a level when they reach area H39 for the first time, regardless of the route by which they get there. Thus, if they were 8th level at the start of this chapter, they will be 9th level when they enter Ythryn for the first time.

## Race to the Glacier

If **Vellynne Harpell** survived the perils of Auril's island and returned to Icewind Dale with the characters, she urges them to accompany her to the glacier without delay, lest one of her rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood catch up to them. Vellynne can be persuaded to delay the journey, but with each passing day, she becomes more agitated.

### Random Encounters

You can use the "Wilderness Encounters" section in *chapter 2* to make the characters' journey to the Reghed Glacier more challenging, to level up the characters, or both. If the characters are 8th level already, it's probably best to skip over the random encounters and proceed with the "Elk and Tiger" section below.

### Elk and Tiger

With grand events having been set in motion, those sensitive to prophecy have begun to experience dreams and visions. One such person is **Mjenir**, a fifty-year-old shaman of the Reghed Elk Tribe, who received a vision about the characters' journey to the Reghed Glacier.

#### Elk Tribe Escort

Several hours before the party reaches the glacier, read:

>>As you crest another ridge, you spot a dozen humanoids approaching, their cloaks flapping in the wind sweeping down from the eastern glacier.
>>

The approaching figures are ten **tribal warriors** of the Elk Tribe, led by **Mjenir** (neutral human **druid** with Survival +4) and **Hengar Aesnvaard** (neutral good human **gladiator** with Survival +5). **Mjenir** waves at the characters to signal his peaceful intentions. If they are willing to speak, he directs them to a rocky alcove where both parties can enjoy a reprieve from the wind.

**Mjenir** proceeds to explain his vision and warns of grave danger ahead:

>>"Tigers with ice in their veins come to spill your blood upon the snow. They will do everything in their power to keep you from finding what the Frostmaiden has preserved under the ice."
>>

**Mjenir** and his fellow Elk tribesfolk volunteer to escort the party to the foot of the Reghed Glacier. If the characters refuse that offer, the Elk tribesfolk return whence they came. **Mjenir** wishes them well and says, "The fate of the dale rests upon your shoulders."

#### Tiger Tribe Ambush

When the characters reach the glacial wall, read:

>>The Reghed Glacier rises hundreds of feet into the sky. The foot of the glacier is still a half-mile away.
>>
>>Suddenly, nearly two dozen figures burst out of the snow sixty feet away from you. They are spaced roughly ten feet apart and begin advancing in a line.
>>

Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher are not surprised by the ambush, nor are members of the Elk Tribe who are traveling with the party.

***Ambushers.*** **Mjenir** was not the only one who foresaw the characters' path. The queen of the Tiger Tribe, **Bjornhild Solvigsdottir** (see appendix C), has also been stirred to action. Bjornhild worships Auril and is furious that the party has decided to meddle in the Frostmaiden's affairs. If Bjornhild died earlier in the adventure, replace her with a **frost druid** (see *appendix C*) named Ajka.

If Bjornhild leads the ambush, she is joined by her pet **saber-toothed tiger**, Grava. If Ajka leads the ambush, give her a woolly **rhinoceros** companion. Twenty **tribal warriors** make up the rest of the ambushing force. Before closing to melee range, they hurl spears at the characters.

***Elk Tribe Reaction.*** If the characters allowed **Mjenir**, Hengar, and the other Elk tribesfolk to accompany them, the two leaders are confident in their ability to fight off the attackers while the characters race toward the glacier. If the characters let the Elk Tribe members fend off the Tigers, the outcome of the battle depends on whether Bjornhild leads the ambush:

- If Bjornhild leads the ambush, both she and Grava survive, as does Hengar. All three are reduced to half their hit points (rounded down). Everyone else is slain. Bjornhild takes Hengar prisoner and interprets the characters' escape as a sign that Auril intends to slay them herself; consequently, Bjornhild doesn't pursue them.
- If Ajka leads the ambush, she and Hengar are the sole survivors with half their hit points remaining. After a brief standoff, Ajka polymorphs into a snowy owl and flees, leaving the wounded Hengar alone.

Characters who refuse to let the Elk Tribe fight this battle without them are attacked by Bjornhild and her saber-toothed tiger (or Ajka and her rhinoceros) while Hengar and his fellow Elk Tribe warriors clash with the rest of the attacking force. You can forgo making attack rolls for the tribal warriors; assume that they all act on the same initiative count and that one warrior from each tribe dies each round on that tribe's turn. Hengar kills an additional Tiger Tribe warrior on each of his turns. **Mjenir** stays out of melee and uses his *produce flame* cantrip to hurl fire at enemies.

## Opening the Way

When the characters reach the wall of the Reghed Glacier at the spot specified by **Vellynne Harpell** or Professor Skant, read:

>>An immense, glistening wall of blue ice stands before you. It seems impenetrable, but then you notice that a lighter-colored stripe nearly bisects the wall at one point. This must be the frozen waterfall Vellynne spoke of!
>>

Vellynne or *Professor Skant* urges one of the characters to read aloud the "Rime of the Frostmaiden" (see *appendix E*). Reading the poem aloud while standing before the glacier has the following effect:

>>As the last words of the poem are spoken, a rumbling sound comes from deep within the glacier. The noise reaches a crescendo as the great wall of ice parts. Through the crack, you can see an opening that leads inside the glacier.
>>

Once the way is open, the party is free to descend into the newly formed tunnel (area H1).

## Into the Caves of Hunger

When the floating city of Ythryn plummeted from the sky into the Reghed Glacier centuries ago, the impact of the collision (and the resulting heat) drove the city deeper into its heart until, finally, it came to rest. Auril then buried the city under the ice to preserve it, claiming it as her own.

The Caves of Hunger is a sprawling dungeon complex hollowed out of the Reghed Glacier. Some of its caves and tunnels formed naturally, some formed as a byproduct of Ythryn's fall, and still others are the work of creatures such as remorhazes that can dig or melt their way through solid ice. The fact that the entire complex is made of ice contributes to its alien atmosphere. The air is often stale, sound behaves strangely, and the tension of moving ever downward wears on the sanity of even the boldest adventurers.

### General Features

The following features are common throughout the Caves of Hunger:

- **Ceilings.** Most cavern ceilings are 30 feet high and made of smooth ice. Tunnel ceilings range from 10 to 15 feet high unless otherwise noted.
- **Darkness.** All areas are cast in complete darkness unless otherwise noted.

***Echoes.*** Sound travels quickly here. All Wisdom (Perception) checks to hear sounds in these caves have advantage.

- **Ice Slides.** As remorhazes burrow through ice, the heat radiating from their bodies smooths out the sides of the tunnels behind them to a glass-like finish. Many of these passages are severely sloped, creating ice slides. Descending an ice slide is easy; climbing one is another matter. A character needs crampons or other climbing gear to ascend one of these slippery passages.

#### Professor Skant

If the characters have *Professor Skant* with them, the *professor orb* can provide educational commentary on certain features found in the Caves of Hunger, as noted in the text, provided the orb is in a position where it can view its surroundings.

#### Psychic Hauntings

The Caves of Hunger have a way of capturing and holding on to psychic trauma. In certain locations, the text will ask you to check for a psychic haunting, in which case roll a d20 and consult the Psychic Haunting table to determine if the area contains a haunting. If one is present, its image or its effect can't leave the cave in which it's encountered.

##### Psychic Hauntings
|  d12 | Haunting                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:----:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1  | A man wanders around in the cavern. His fingers are black with frostbite, and his mouth is agape in a silent scream. Although he appears real, the man is no more substantial than a phantom and does not respond to any interaction. |
|   2  | One party member (determined randomly) hears a stream of whispers. The character can't make out what's being said but can hear their name mentioned now and then. The whispers can't be tracked to a source.                          |
|   3  | Each party member sees their companions' flesh wither as black worms crawl out of their ears, noses, and mouths. The effect is illusory, harmless, and fleeting.                                                                      |
|   4  | One party member (determined randomly) hears footsteps behind them when they move. When they stand still, the party member can feel hot breath against the back of their neck. The effect is illusory and harmless.                   |
|   5  | Each party member detects a familiar scent in this cavern that reminds them of some tragic or fearful event in their past. The scent does not have a source.                                                                          |
|   6  | One party member (determined randomly) sees a dark, hulking shape moving through the wall, ceiling, or floor, as though it were swimming through the ice. The effect is illusory, harmless, and fleeting.                             |
| 7Ã¢ÂÂ12 | No haunting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Tekeli-li

Of all the creatures that claim the Caves of Hunger as their lair, perhaps the most fearsome is Tekeli-li, a **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*).

When they cracked open the Reghed Glacier, the characters unsealed the glacial prison holding Tekeli-li. After decades of captivity and starvation, the vampire is once again free to leave the caves and haunt Icewind Dale. First, however, it plans to feed. The vampire is the only wandering monster that the characters encounter in the Caves of Hunger, and they are likely to encounter it more than once as they descend deeper into the caves.

**Vellynne Harpell**'s *professor orb*, *Professor Skant*, is an expert on vampires and vampirism. Once it becomes aware of Tekeli-li, the *professor orb* shares the vampire's known weaknesses with the characters.

The party should meet Tekeli-li several times. The vampire's strategy is to drain the party's resources, then retreat and recover before attacking again. If Tekeli-li ever takes more than 20 damage during an encounter, the vampire turns to mist and withdraws to a safe location in the dungeon. Even when the vampire is not immediately present, its cackling laughter echoes through the caves sporadically.

You can stage an encounter with Tekeli-li anywhere you like. If you're not sure where it might be or how it should behave, roll a d6 and consult the Tekeli-li's Location table. The table determines where the vampire is first encountered. If the vampire withdraws, roll again on the table to determine where it goes (roll again if the result indicates no change in its location).

If the characters have not encountered the vampire by the time they reach area H36, it attacks them there.

##### Tekeli-li's Location
|  d6 | Location                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Area H6. As the characters make their way through area H5 or H7, Tekeli-li exits the ruined tower in mist form, assumes its Large hyena form, and attacks.                                                                |
|  2  | Area H12. Tekeli-li waits for the encounter with the shadows in area H11 to conclude before attacking the party in its Large hyena form.                                                                                  |
|  3  | Area H19. Tekeli-li waits for the characters in its lair and emerges from the northernmost cave in its gnoll form when they enter.                                                                                        |
|  4  | Area H23. Tekeli-li is in mist form, hiding inside the steam rising from the pool. If the remorhazes in the pool attack the party, Tekeli-li joins the fight on the second round of combat after assuming its gnoll form. |
|  5  | Area H32. Tekeli-li lurks here in its gnoll form and attacks the characters as soon as they enter. Its keen smell cancels out the sight-based disadvantage imposed by this location.                                      |
|  6  | Area H36. Tekeli-li lurks among the trees in its Large hyena form. The dryad refuses to emerge from her tree while the vampire is in her grove.                                                                           |

![Map 6.1: Caves of Hunger](img/adventure/IDRotF/171-map-6.1-caves-of-hunger.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/172-map-6.1-caves-of-hunger-player.webp)
### Caves of Hunger Locations (H1-H10)

The following locations are keyed to map 6.1.

#### H1. Into the Glacier

The light blue area shown on map 6.1 indicates the section of glacial wall that parts when the characters use the "Rime of the Frostmaiden" to cut a path to the dungeon. Reading the poem creates an opening in the ice wall that's 100 feet high, 30 feet wide, and 20 feet deep. A tunnel at the back of this opening contains uneven, naturally formed steps that descend to area H2.

If any of the Elk tribesfolk are present at this point, they volunteer to guard this entrance until the characters return or until hunger forces them to abandon their post.

#### H2. Crashed Skycoach

>>You come to a thirty-foot-high cavern. In its center, the remains of a wooden ship hull rest on the floor.
>>

If *Professor Skant* is allowed to view the wreckage, the *professor orb* offers the following commentary:

>>"Ah, a Netherese skycoach! I've always wanted to ride on one of those. Pity it's no longer in one piece."
>>

The ship is all that remains of a Netherese skycoach, an airship that was used to ferry people to and from the floating city of Ythryn. Any loud disturbances in this cave cause the four **flameskulls** in area H3 to cackle madly as they make their way to this cavern. The flameskulls are the animated, fire-wreathed skulls of Netherese wizards transformed into guardians by the will of the Frostmaiden.

The tunnel that leads to area H5 has a slippery, 20-foot-tall drop-off that characters can descend safely with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed check, a character slips and lands prone, taking damage from the fall as normal.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the wreckage find the headless skeletons of four dead Netherese wizards and a 200-pound iron safe with a combination lock that has numbers from 0 to 50 written in the Draconic script. A character using thieves' tools can spend 1 minute trying to open the safe, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The safe contains a *bag of holding*, inside which are four amethysts (100 gp each) and a *ring of the ram* made of chardalyn (see the "*Chardalyn*" sidebar). The ring's unusual composition has no effect on its magical properties.

#### H3. Flameskulls

These two 15-foot-high caves and passageways are occupied by four **flameskulls**Ã¢ÂÂtwo in the caves west of area H2 and two in the caves northeast of area H2. They attack intruders on sight. The caves are otherwise empty.

#### H4. Kobold Vampire Spawn

Characters coming from area H2 must descend a naturally formed staircase of ice to reach this cave.

>>Frost-covered blocks of stone jut from the floor of this ten-foot-high cave of ice. Perched atop the largest stone is an emaciated kobold with glowing red eyes. It bares elongated fangs as it hisses at you, then scampers away.
>>

The creature is a **kobold vampire spawn** (see appendix C) created by Tekeli-li. *Professor Skant* recognizes the creature as a vampire and knows its weaknesses. The undead kobold hungers for fresh blood but knows better than to attack a superior force. It tries to rejoin its kin in area H17.

#### H5. Icicle Drop

>>Sparkling icicles as long as longswords cling to the forty-foot-high roof of this cavern, the floor of which is strewn with frost-covered blocks of stone and a toppled pillar. Embedded in the east wall is a glittering stone tower that appears to have crashed through the ceiling long ago. The exposed wall is cracked and has a few small holes in it but is otherwise intact.
>>

If *Professor Skant* is allowed to view the tower, the *professor orb* offers the following commentary:

>>"That tower appears to be of Netherese construction. Were it not for the cracks and holes, the stone would be smooth as glass, shaped by wizardly magic!"
>>

Seven **ice mephits** created by Auril cling to the ceiling, their wings wrapped tightly around their bodies so that they are easily mistaken for icicles. Characters who have passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of 13 or higher can distinguish the mephits from the scores of real icicles that festoon the ceiling.

The ice mephits are tasked with guarding the cave but do not enter melee combat willingly. An ice mephit's preferred tactic is to use its action to fly next to an icicle and break it off, causing it to fall on an enemy below. Any creature standing under a falling icicle must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) piercing damage from it.

***Tekeli-li.*** If Tekeli-li is hiding in area H6, the **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*) attacks the party after the ice mephits are dealt with, passing through the tower wall in mist form and assuming its Large hyena form. See the "Tekeli-li" section earlier in this chapter for more information.

#### H6. Ruined Tower

Characters who peer through the cracks and holes in the tower walls see the following:

>>Little remains of this tower besides its outer shell. The interior walls are decorated with shifting geometric patterns. A human skeleton in a white robe lies on the uneven floor.
>>

If *Professor Skant* is allowed to view the interior, the *professor orb* offers the following commentary:

>>"Netherese spellcasters would come to towers like this one to regain their spent magic more quickly. Despite the extensive damage, I would venture to guess that the tower still works!"
>>

A character who examines the shifting geometric patterns can, with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check, come to the same conclusion as Professor Skant.

The characters can punch a hole in the tower's outer wall that's big enough for them to crawl or walk through. Any character who takes a short rest in the tower regains one spell slot of 3rd level or lower at the end of that rest. A character can't gain this benefit again for 24 hours.

***Treasure.*** The skeleton is the remains of a Netherese priest. It wears a silver holy symbol shaped like a four-pointed star (25 gp). A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check identifies it as a holy symbol of Mystryl (see the "Mystryl" sidebar).

#### H7. Rubble-Strewn Cave

Aside from the tower embedded in the west wall (see area 6) and the rubble around it, this 30-foot-high cavern is empty. A naturally formed staircase to the southeast descends to area H10.

***Tekeli-li.*** If Tekeli-li is hiding in area H6, the **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*) passes through the tower wall in mist form, assumes its Large hyena form, and attacks the characters as they cross the cave or get within 10 feet of the tower. See the "Tekeli-li" section earlier in this chapter for more information.

> ##### Mystryl
>
>The history and fate of the god Mystryl are tied up in the story of Netheril's fall. Mystryl was the original god of magic. She is said to have created the Weave, which enables spellcasting. A Netherese mage named Karsus sought to steal Mystryl's godly power. To prevent certain doom from befalling the material world, Mystryl sacrificed herself to keep Karsus from achieving his goal. After her sacrifice, Mystryl was reincarnated as Mystra and is now worshiped across FaerÃÂ»n. For more information about Netheril and its fall, see *chapter 7*.
>

#### H8. Arcane Eye Activator

>>A flat, slightly canted slab of stone rests in the center of this twenty-foot-high cave. One side is rough, as if the slab had been torn from a larger structure. The slab is eight feet long, four feet wide, four feet high, and covered with frost.
>>

Scraping off the frost on the slab reveals Draconic script etched into its top, with an open eye carved above it. Close examination reveals that the pupil of the eye is a stone button that can be pressed. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the slab.

If *Professor Skant* sees the script, the *professor orb* informs the characters that the Netherese used the Draconic script (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue" sidebar). If the characters don't know Draconic, Professor Skant can translate the script for them. It reads:

>>"Take the free, self-guided tour of Ythryn. Press the eye to cast the spell."
>>

A character can use an action to press the eye, thereby using the slab to cast the *arcane eye* spell. The spell lasts for 1 hour or until the character's concentration on the spell ends. The slab, which used to function whenever the button was pressed, is damaged. Once the spell is cast, the slab ceases to be magical.

![A halfling adventurer encounters the head of a decapitated iron golem](img/adventure/IDRotF/173-06-001.iron-golem.webp)

#### H9. Golem Head

>>Lying on its side in the middle of this twenty-foot-high cave is an enormous head made of iron, its eyes aglow with a golden light.
>>

Iron golems were used as sentries throughout Ythryn. This head is all that remains of a golem that was decapitated when the city crashed. It has been separated from the city and its body ever since. The potent magic used in the golem's construction has kept the head functional.

The head can't attack or use its Poison Breath in this state, nor can it speak. It can communicate by blinking the lights in its eyesÃ¢ÂÂone blink for no, two blinks for yes, three blinks for "I don't know." It understands Elvish and Loross (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue" sidebar). If the characters know none of these languages, Professor Skant can communicate with the golem in Loross on their behalf.

Here are examples of the questions the party might ask, and the golem's responses:

- "Do you know where Ythryn is?" (No.)
- "Were you damaged when the city fell?" (Yes.)
- "Is there danger ahead?" (I don't know.)
- "Have other creatures passed through this cave recently?" (Yes. The golem is referring to the kobold vampire spawn that lair in the caves to the east.)

> ##### Loross: the Netherese Tongue
>
>Loross, a language spoken by the Netherese, is a dead tongue. Very few creatures in the world today would recognize it, much less speak it. Loross used the Draconic alphabet in its written form, while the spoken language had many similarities with Elvish, due to the cultural influence the elves had on Netherese civilization. A character who speaks Elvish can understand what a creature speaking Loross is saying, and vice versa. A character who has the Cloistered Scholar or Sage background, or a warlock who knows the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation, can translate written Loross without an ability check.
>

#### H10. Toppled Spire

This cave might contain a psychic haunting (see "Psychic Hauntings").

>>The top of a partially shattered tower rests on its side in the middle of this thirty-foot-high cavern. Long icicles hang from the ceiling above the toppled spire. North of the tower is a fifteen-foot-diameter hole in the floor that seems to be the upper end of a tunnel.
>>

The hole in the floor is the mouth of a glass-smooth tunnel created by the remorhaz in area H24. A creature that slides down this ice chute gains enough speed along the way to propel itself into the heated pool at the bottom, provoking the remorhaz that is submerged in it. The creature can avoid this fate if, upon reaching the end of the slide, it makes a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw to stop itself from going into the pool.

Access to the toppled tower can be had through its east side, which is open though surrounded by rubble.

***Treasure.*** Tucked inside the attic's spire is a wooden chest with a sliding bolt latch held fast by frost. A character can melt away the ice on the latch using a torch or other open flame. Most of the bottles inside the chest were smashed in the fall, but two *potions of healing (superior)* survived.

### Caves of Hunger Locations (H11-H21)

#### H11. Den of Shadows

Naturally formed stairs lead up to area H9 and down to area H15. A wide passage to the east leads to area H13, with a branching tunnel to area H12.

Twelve **shadows** haunt this 30-foot-high cave. They swarm over members of the party but recoil from any character who presents a holy symbol of Mystryl.

The shadows were born from those who survived Ythryn's crash, only to face starvation. Driven mad by trauma and hunger, the group of survivors resorted to cannibalism. These victims rose as shadows to take vengeance upon the last surviving member of the group, and their hatred extends to other living creatures as well.

***Tekeli-li.*** If Tekeli-li is hiding in area H12, the **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*) attacks the characters in its Large hyena form once the shadows are dealt with.

#### H12. Curse of Hunger

>>This twenty-foot-high cavern tapers to a dead end. A dozen human skeletons sheathed in frost lie on the uneven floor, but their skulls appear to be missing.
>>

The frozen skeletons are the remains of the Netherese cannibals whose shadows haunt area H11. Characters who scrape off the frost and examine the bones see teeth marks on them. The missing skulls were taken by kobold vampire spawn and placed in area H20.

Terrible psychic trauma lingers in this cave, causing any creature that enters it to feel intensely hungry, even after leaving the cave. Eating a handful of food keeps the creature's hunger at bay for 1 hour. If its hunger isn't satisfied within 1 minute, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. The saving throw must be repeated every hour until the creature succeeds or dies, or until the effect is ended on that creature by magic that can remove a curse. A creature that doesn't require food automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the effect ends on a creature, it becomes immune to the cave's psychic trauma. This immunity does not remove levels of exhaustion gained from the creature's earlier failed saves.

***Treasure.*** One skeleton at the back of the cave wears a tarnished silver holy symbol shaped like a four-pointed star (25 gp) around its neck. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check identifies it as a holy symbol of Mystryl (see the "*Mystryl*" sidebar).

![Tekeli-li the gnoll vampire assumes hyena form as it sneaks up behind unsuspecting prey](img/adventure/IDRotF/174-06-002.gnoll-vampire.webp)

#### H13. Icicle-Filled Cave

>>This cavern has a ten-foot-high ceiling covered with icicles that nearly touch the floor, forming thin stalactites. Several of these icicles have been broken off, leaving paths that lead to the cave's four exitsÃ¢ÂÂnarrow tunnels to the east and south, and wider tunnels to the west and northeast.
>>
>>High-pitched barking and yipping echoes throughout the cave, but you can't tell which direction the sounds come from.
>>

The icicles are more of a nuisance than an obstacle and can be easily broken, although smashing them creates enough noise to alert the creatures in area H17.

Because of the acoustics in the cave, the characters must be within 5 feet of the east tunnel to discern that the barking and yipping is coming from that direction. The east tunnel has a rough-hewn staircase leading down to area H17. A similar staircase in the south tunnel leads down to area H16.

#### H14. Ice Sculptures

>>Peering into this ten-foot-high cavern, you come face to face with an army of small, misshapen ice sculptures.
>>

Add the following if the characters haven't confronted the kobold vampire spawn in area H17:

>>An incessant yipping noise fills the cave, originating from a tunnel in the south wall that contains a rough-hewn staircase leading down into darkness.
>>

Crammed into this cave are twenty 3-foot-tall ice sculptures that the kobold vampire spawn have made to startle and frighten intruders. Each statue is carved in the vague likeness of a kobold, which a character can discern with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Each ice sculpture is a Small object that weighs roughly 40 pounds and has AC 13, 5 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. Smashing any of the sculptures alerts the kobold vampire spawn in area H17.

#### H15. Drakareth's Doom

This location consists of multiple areas:

- An empty cave to the northeast has a 20-foot-high domed ceiling, naturally formed stairs leading up to area H11, and a narrow tunnel leading east toward areas H16 and H22.
- A cave to the southwest has an uneven ceiling that ranges in height from 15 to 30 feet. A **wraith** named Drakareth haunts this cave, northwest of which are three cysts blocked off by thick walls of ice. The northernmost cyst contains Drakareth's earthly remains and treasure (see "Treasure" below).

When one or more characters enter the wraith's cave, read:

>>A deep sigh issues from the darkness. A voice steeped in malevolence and hatred whispers to you in a language reminiscent of Elvish.
>>

The wraith speaks Loross (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue" sidebar), which *Professor Skant* can translate if necessary. Its words are as follows:

>>"Cursed be those who gaze upon the horror that Drakareth has become. Such promise wasted, lost in this cold sepulcher! Where were you centuries years ago when he was in the prime of life? Where were you when the frigid darkness consumed him? You are no good to Drakareth now! Nothing remains of him but frozen bones, ancient treasures, and me."
>>

Drakareth was a Netherese mage who survived the fall of Ythryn, murdered his wounded rivals, and stole their spellbooks and magic items. He had hoped to escape with his newfound treasures but perished from exhaustion and cold, rising as a wraith. The wraith seeks the destruction of all who enter its chamber. If successfully turned or reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, the wraith retreats to the icy cyst that contains Drakareth's frozen remains, passing through the interposing walls of ice to reach it. There, it fights to the bitter end.

The walls of ice that separate the smaller cysts from the larger cave are thick enough to be opaque, but characters can break through them. Each 5-foot-square, 1-foot-thick section of wall has AC 13, 18 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.

***Treasure.*** Beyond three walls of ice, in the northernmost cyst, is the frost-covered skeleton of Drakareth, clad in a *mantle of spell resistance* and surrounded by the rotted remains of six ancient, leather-bound spellbooks that are no longer legible and a cracked crystal ball that is no longer magical. Clutched in the dead mage's hands is a *staff of charming* fashioned out of chardalyn suffused with evil Netherese magic.

Anyone who attunes to Drakareth's staff gains the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting personality trait: "I like to give orders and expect to be obeyed." This flaw lasts until the attunement ends.

#### H16. Ice Cave

Although this cave is empty, it might contain a psychic haunting (see "Psychic Hauntings").

This ice cave has a 25-foot-high, domed ceiling festooned with icicles. A rough-hewn staircase leads up to area H14, and an opening in the middle of the south wall breaches a tunnel connecting areas H15 and H22.

***Slaad Host.*** If one of the characters has the Slaad Host secret (see *appendix B*) and the **slaad tadpole** hasn't been born or destroyed yet, it bursts from the character's chest in this cavern.

#### H17. Den of the Vampire Spawn

>>The yips and barks abate as you descend the stairs leading to this cave in which hangs the faint whiff of death.
>>

Five **kobold vampire spawn** (see appendix C) dwell here. Add a sixth if the one from area H4 escaped and made it all the way here. These creatures have sharp senses and know when living creatures are nearby. They use their Spider Climb trait to cling to the walls and pounce on the first character to enter their lair. The vampires fight until two or more of their number are slain, whereupon the rest retreat to area H19 to make their final stand. *Professor Skant* recognizes the creature as vampires and knows their weaknesses.

Aside from the vampires, the cave is empty. The 20-foot-high ceiling is festooned with icicles.

***Stench of Death.*** A tunnel to the south contains a staircase that leads down to area H19. The stench of death grows stronger as one descends these stairs.

#### H18. Snow Golems

These areas have slippery, uneven floors. Scores of icicles hang from the ceilings, which range in height from 15 to 30 feet.

***Southern Cave.*** Naturally formed stairs descend to the southernmost cave. Describe its contents as follows:

>>This dead-end cave contains a half dozen mounds of snow that rise up and assume vaguely bipedel forms. Wide smiles appear on their otherwise featureless heads.
>>

These creatures are six **snow golems** (see *appendix C*). They are hostile toward all trespassers but don't pursue intruders beyond the confines of the three caves that comprise area H18.

#### H19. Den of Death

>>This thirty-foot-high cavern reeks of death. The floor is slippery and slightly concave.
>>

If Tekeli-li is here, the **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*) lurks in the northernmost side cave. When one or more intruders enter its den, Tekeli-li emerges from this smaller cave in its gnoll form and attacks. See the "Tekeli-li" section earlier in this chapter for more information. Any **kobold vampire spawn** that retreated to this cavern are hidden in the northeastern side cave. They gang up on whichever foe Tekeli-li chooses to attack.

***Slippery Ice.*** The icy floor is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto the ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

***Stench of Death.*** A naturally formed staircase in the southern wall leads down to areas H20 and H21. The stench of death intensifies the closer one gets to area H20.

#### H20. Ice Crypt

>>The deathly stench originates from this ten-foot-high cave, where a dozen human skulls surround a pillar of ice. A large cavity has been opened in the pillar, as if something had burst from inside it.
>>

This is the chamber where Tekeli-li lay dormant, encased in ice, until the characters opened the Caves of Hunger with the "Rime of the Frostmaiden" and awakened him. Kobold vampire spawn found the human skulls in area H12 and placed them at the base of the pillar to show their devotion to Tekeli-li.

A search of this cave yields nothing of value, as Tekeli-li has no interest in treasure.

#### H21. Frozen Frost Giant

>>Entombed in the icy floor of this twenty-foot-high cave is the frozen, well-preserved corpse of a frost giant. Scratch marks in the ice suggest a half-hearted attempt to excavate the remains.
>>

A frost giant named Vlagomir was walking across the glacier when Ythryn fell to its doom. The giant was crushed to death as the Netherese city plunged into a deep crevasse and became buried under tons of ice.

Characters can reach the giant's corpse by chipping through 2 feet of ice. If they do so, they discover that the giant had nothing of value. The scratch marks in the ice were made by kobold vampire spawn who sought to feed on the corpse but quickly tired of digging through the solid ice.

### Caves of Hunger Locations (H22-H31)

#### H22. Borehole

This cave might contain a psychic haunting (see "Psychic Hauntings").

>>This thirty-foot-high cave has exits to the north and south. Along the western side is a fifteen-foot-diameter hole in the floor that seems to be the upper end of a tunnel.
>>

The ice slide descends to area H23.

#### H23. Remorhaz Nest

>>This bulbous cavern has walls as smooth as glass and a ceiling lined with dripping icicles. A wisp of steam rises from a roughly circular pool in the northern half of the cave. South of the pool is a shallow crater filled with oversized snowballs.
>>

Two **young remorhazes** lurk at the bottom of the pool, which is 15 feet deep. Their tremorsense alerts them to the presence of intruders, and they attack immediately.

The creatures' bodies heat the pool, causing it to give off steam. The water is not hot enough to deal damage. Without the body heat of a remorhaz to keep the water warm, a pool's surface freezes over in 1 hour. After 24 hours, the pool is frozen solid.

***Tekeli-li.*** If Tekeli-li is here, the **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*) is in mist form, hiding in the steam. The characters can sense the vampire only if they have magic that can detect the presence of undead. As the young remorhazes engage the characters in battle, Tekeli-li assumes its gnoll form and joins the fray, keeping its distance from the remorhazes. See the "Tekeli-li" section earlier in this chapter for more information.

***Eggs.*** The "snowballs" in the shallow crater are six unhatched remorhaz eggs, each one frozen to or partially embedded in the icy floor. Each egg is a Medium object with AC 13, 6 hit points, and resistance to cold and fire damage. Reducing an egg to 0 hit points kills the unborn remorhaz inside it. Left alone, the eggs won't hatch until they are placed in a heated pool for a period of 4d6 days.

***Treasure.*** An undamaged remorhaz egg can be sold to an interested buyer in Bryn Shander for up to 500 gp.

![A remorhaz uses its body heat to warm the pool containing its unborn young](img/adventure/IDRotF/175-06-003.remorhaz.webp)

#### H24. Remorhaz Mother

>>This enormous cave has glassy walls and a smooth, domed ceiling forty feet overhead. The cavern contains two large pools, both of which have steam rising from them.
>>

Each pool is 15 feet deep. Submerged in the northern pool is a full-grown **remorhaz** coiled around a cluster of eight remorhaz eggs, which look like oversized snowballs from a distance (see area H23 for more information about remorhaz eggs). A **young remorhaz** is submerged in the southern pool and eagerly joins any battle involving its mother. The remorhazes' tremorsense alerts them to the presence of intruders.

The remorhazes' bodies heat the pools, causing steam to rise from them. The water is not hot enough to deal damage. Without the body heat of a remorhaz to keep the water warm, a pool's surface freezes over in 1 hour. After 24 hours, the pool is frozen solid.

#### H25. Empty Side Caves

Although these caves are empty, one or both of them might contain a psychic haunting (see "Psychic Hauntings").

Each cave has a ceiling that ranges in height from 10 to 20 feet.

> ##### To the Underdark
>
>West of area H24, a remorhaz tunnel leads down to the Underdark. The slide extends for a mile under the glacier before breaching a stone cavern lit by bioluminescent moss growing on the walls. The bioluminescence is persistent throughout the Underdark, and it's clear to characters who end up here that they are no longer on track to find Ythryn. Their only options are to return to the Caves of Hunger or continue exploring the Underdark. The latter option is beyond the scope of this adventure.
>

#### H26. Egg-Shaped Cave

This cave might contain a psychic haunting (see "Psychic Hauntings").

>>This chamber rises to a height of forty feet and is shaped like an egg. The floor is slightly concave and sinks toward a fifteen-foot-diameter hole in the floor that seems to be the upper end of a tunnel.
>>

The ice slide descends to area H36.

#### H27. West Observation Platform

>>Clinging to the thirty-foot-high ceiling of this cavern is a forest of icicles, some of which have grown to a length of five feet or more. Embedded in the south wall is a cylindrical, domed building made of seamless black stone and decorated with faintly glowing constellations. Rime-covered statues of human wizards stand in front of this building, gazing outward from atop three-foot-high stone pedestals. The building and statues are raised by a five-foot-high, curved stone platform enclosed by a low wall, with stone steps leading up to it.
>>

See area H28 for a description of the stone building's interior. The constellations on the building's outside wall shed dim light out to a range of 15 feetÃ¢ÂÂjust far enough to backlight the frost-covered statues that encircle it.

***Statues.*** *Professor Skant* can ascertain that the statues were sculpted by magic and that, given their costuming, they depict Netherese wizards. A character can do the same with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check.

Hiding behind the two westernmost statues are two male **drow elite warriors** named Meldirn and Tlaknar. They cast *faerie fire* spells on intruders before attacking with their hand crossbows. They are soon joined by Yilsebek, the **drow mage** in area H28, who tries to engulf as many enemies as possible with his *cloudkill* spell. For more information about the drow and why they're here, see area H28.

If there are too many foes for the drow to deal with on their own, Yilsebek tries to summon a **shadow demon** to assist. If defeat is inevitable, Yilsebek casts *fly* on himself, heads up the ice slide toward area H24, and flees back to the Underdark through the remorhaz tunnels, leaving Meldirn and Tlaknar to fend for themselves.

#### H28. Drow Outpost

>>Much of this building has collapsed, but the front room is intactÃ¢ÂÂand also free of ice and frost. The remnants of smashed furnishings suggest that the room once served as a wizard's workshop. Atop a splintered table is a brimstone cube small enough to hold in one hand. The air around the cube ripples, as it seems to be putting out enough dry heat to warm the room.
>>

A **drow mage** named Yilsebek Dalambra has turned this partially collapsed Netherese building into an outpost. From here, he intends to launch a full-blown expedition into the ruins of Ythryn, which he and his fellow drow discovered a few weeks ago. The drow entered the Caves of Hunger by scaling a remorhaz tunnel that connects to the Underdark. Using a *sending* spell, Yilsebek has asked the matron mother of his house to send reinforcements, but they are weeks away.

Yilsebek has no desire to share his recent discovery with potential rivals, nor does he trust surface-dwellers. For these reasons, characters can't persuade Yilsebek to join forces with them.

***Treasure.*** The source of the room's heat is a *thermal cube* (see *appendix D*) that Yilsebek found during his last foray into Ythryn.

Yilsebek carries a spider silk satchel that contains his spellbook (described below), a spider-shaped brooch made of obsidian and engraved with the symbol of House Dalambra (25 gp), and a half-empty bottle of Elverquisst (a rare, ruby-colored elven liquor distilled from sunshine and rare summer fruits). *Professor Skant* recognizes Elverquisst on sight, since he is an expert on the making of it. Elf characters would also recognize it.

Yilsebek's spellbook has black leather covers and pages made from sheets of trillimac (an Underdark fungus). The book contains the following spells: *alter self*, *cloudkill*, *comprehend languages*, *detect magic*, *Evard's black tentacles*, *fabricate*, *fly*, *greater invisibility*, *lightning bolt*, *mage armor*, *magic missile*, *misty step*, *sending*, *shield*, *suggestion*, *web*, and *witch bolt*.

#### H29. East Observation Platform

If the characters aren't already familiar with the structures described in areas H27 and H28, use the following boxed text to describe them:

>>Icicles cling to the twenty-foot-high ceiling of this ice cavern. Embedded in the south wall is a domed, circular building made of seamless black stone and decorated with faintly glowing constellations. A frost-covered statue of a human wizard stands outside it, gazing outward from atop a three-foot-high stone pedestal. The building and statue rest on a five-foot-high, curved stone platform enclosed by a low wall.
>>

Frost-covered stone steps descend from the stone platform to the icy floor in the cavern's northernmost section, as shown on *map 6.1*.

Auril the Frostmaiden has transformed ten of the icicles that cling to the ceiling into creatures resembling piercers. They use the **piercer** stat block, have immunity to cold damage, and deal 10 (3d6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage on a hit. The drow in areas H27 and H28 are aware of the **ice piercers**, having seen them creep along the ceiling, and do their best to avoid them.

#### H30. Vlagomir's Spark

>>This cavern has a fifteen-foot-high ceiling and a smaller, dead-end cave at the back of it. Sticking out of the larger cave's floor at a sixty-degree angle is a giant-sized wooden spear with its obsidian tip pointing upward. The weapon glows with a faint, cold light.
>>

The spear is 25 feet long, but only its top half is visible; the rest of it is lodged in the icy floor. Pulling it free requires an action and a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) check.

***Treasure.*** The spear belonged to a frost giant named Vlagomir, whose remains can be found in area H21. The giant was a hunter of white dragons and a Chosen of Thrym, the evil god of frost giants. When Vlagomir died, his warrior's spark was bound to the spear. The first time a barbarian, fighter, monk, or ranger touches the spear, the light around the spear fades as Vlagomir's spark bestows the following supernatural charm on the character (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*):

***Vlagomir's Spark.*** You gain 1 foot of height every hour and become proportionately heavier until you stand 21 feet tall and weigh 7,700 pounds. When you are 9 feet tall, your Strength becomes 19 unless it is already higher. For every 3 additional feet of height you gain, your Strength increases by 1, to a maximum of 23. Armor and clothing you are wearing and weapons you are carrying magically increase in size to match your growth. If you are the recipient of a *greater restoration* spell or similar magic, this charm vanishes from you, and you immediately shrink back to normal size, along with any armor, clothing, and weapons in your possession.

### Caves of Hunger Locations (H31-H39)

#### H31. Thing in the Ice

>>A flat sheet of cloudy ice forms one wall of this forty-foot-high cavern. Something dark and humungous shifts behind the wall, its tentacles waving unimpeded. You become aware you are not alone inside your mind. Somehow, this horror from another world has wormed its way inside you.
>>

Something beyond mortal comprehension exists partially inside the wall of ice and partially within some distant, horrific demiplane. As this otherworldly entity peers into the cavern, visitors risk losing their sanity to its influence.

Any creature that comes within 20 feet of the wall of ice is targeted by a *dominate monster* spell (save DC 15). The entity can concentrate on up to ten such spells at once. Any creature that successfully saves against the spell resists it and can't be targeted by this effect again. On a failed save, the creature stands perfectly still and does nothing while the alien entity probes its mind for 1 hour. If a creature remains under the spell's effect for the full duration, it must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw at the end of the hour, taking 44 (8d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Whether the save succeeds or fails, a creature subjected to the hour-long probe also gains a randomly determined form of long-term madness, determined by rolling on the Long-Term Madness table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

The ice wall has AC 13, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. If the wall takes 50 points of damage or more, large cracks form along its surface, and the alien entity withdraws into its distant demiplane, never to return. As it withdraws, its *dominate monster* spells end.

#### H32. Mirrored Cavern

>>Every surface of this twenty-foot-high cave is polished to a mirror finish, such that you are faced with countless distorted reflections of yourself. Your head spins as you try to keep your bearings.
>>

If Tekeli-li is here, add:

>>Crouching in the middle of the cavern is a gaunt gnoll with ravenous eyes and the foul stench of the grave coming from it. The creature does not cast a reflection.
>>

Ranged attack rolls made in this cave have disadvantage because of the disorienting reflections. If Tekeli-li is here, the **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*) uses its Frightful Cackle first, then targets enemies with its Sickening Gaze until one or more them closes to melee range. See the "Tekeli-li" section earlier in this chapter for more of Tekeli-li's tactics.

***Slaad Host.*** If one of the characters has the Slaad Host secret (see *appendix B*) and the **slaad tadpole** hasn't been born or destroyed yet, it bursts from the character's chest when the character enters this cavern.

#### H33. Watcher in the Walls

>>This fifteen-foot-high, U-shaped cavern appears empty at first glance, but a sudden tapping draws your attention to the west wall, within which is trapped a black-robed figure with a golden visage.
>>

A **mummy** dressed in a tattered black robe and wearing a golden face mask is trapped in the western wall and has no way to free itself from the ice. The mummy was created by Netherese priests to serve as a lore-keeper in Ythryn.

The section of ice that traps the mummy has AC 13, 22 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. If the wall is reduced to 0 hit points, the mummy is released and makes its way to area H39 and from there to the library in Ythryn (area Y9 in *chapter 7*). It ignores the characters unless they interfere with it.

***Treasure.*** The mummy's golden mask (750 gp) is a Netherese art object.

#### H34. City Debris

This cave might contain a psychic haunting (see "Psychic Hauntings").

>>Large pieces of stone jut from the twenty-foot-high ceiling of this empty cavern.
>>

The stone fragments are pieces of Ythryn that settled in the ice. Any character who examines the stone and makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check to discern its true nature. (A dwarf's Stonecunning trait can prove helpful here.) If the check succeeds, the character can confirm that the stone is neither naturally formed nor hewn, but rather shaped by magic.

#### H35. Mysterious Cube

>>On the floor in the middle of this fifteen-foot-high cave is an eight-foot cube of smooth, grayish-green stone that is free of frost.
>>

The stone cube is a **spitting mimic** (see *appendix C*). Anything that touches the mimic automatically adheres to it, and a Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 16). The mimic sprouts pseudopods and attacks if it is touched, harmed, or otherwise disturbed.

#### H36. Frozen Grove

If the characters make it this far and haven't yet faced Tekeli-li, the **gnoll vampire** (see *appendix C*) confronts them here in its Large hyena form.

>>A grove of frost-covered trees fills this fifty-foot-high cavern, the floor of which is a mixture of earth and ice. By some magic or miracle, the trees are alive, their canopies thick with frosty leaves, their branches bearing purple pears that hang like ornaments. A low wall, broken in several places, threads its way through the grove, which is surrounded by six exits.
>>

![Purple Pear](img/adventure/IDRotF/176-06-004.purple-pear.webp)

This grove of pear trees was enchanted by Netherese arcanists to endure high altitude and harsh weather. That magic has enabled the trees to thrive even in these icy caverns. Essential to the grove's survival is a **dryad** named Hathowyn, who resides in the southernmost tree. If the dryad dies, the trees die 1d10 days later. Centuries of isolation have made Hathowyn lonely, and the dryad hungers for conversation and companionship.

If Tekeli-li is present, Hathowyn remains hidden in her tree until the gnoll vampire leaves or is destroyed. Tekeli-li has never seen the dryad and is unaware of her presence. If given the chance, Hathowyn tries to engage the characters in conversation, speaking Elvish or Sylvan. She hopes to keep them in the grove for as long as possible. If the characters try to leave, Hathowyn tries to charm one of them into staying and keeping her company. The dryad knows the following information:

- Netherese magic binds the dryad to the grove and keeps the trees alive.
- The pears hanging from the trees are magically delicious.
- Three dark elves have passed through the dryad's grove on multiple occasions, coming and going through the southwest and southeast passages (leading to areas H29 and H39). Hathowyn hasn't spoken to them out of fear that they might harm her.
- Strange, one-eyed creatures lurk in the cave to the south (area H37). They followed the dark elves up from below after their last foray down the southeast passage.

***Purple Pears.*** Each tree has 3d6 ripe pears hanging from its branches, most of them within reach. Any creature that eats more than half of a purple pear gains the benefit of a special charm (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). Determine the charm randomly by rolling a d20 and consulting the Purple Pear Charms table. This charm must vanish from a creature before it can gain any more charms by eating purple pears. A creature that eats three or more purple pears within 1 hour is poisoned for 24 hours thereafter and suffers painful cramps until the condition ends.

#### H37. Weird Insights

>>Huddled together at the west end of this ten-foot-high cave are four hunched creatures with spiny backs and sharp claws. Each one stares at you with a single unblinking eye.
>>

These four **nothics**, evil denizens of Ythryn, followed Yilsebek and his fellow drow as far as the dryad's grove (area H36) before taking refuge in this cave. The nothics use their Weird Insight to glean secrets from the characters. They are reluctant to provoke a well-armed group of adventurers, preferring to pick off lone prey, but if attacked, they respond in kind.

Offering food and drink to the nothics loosens their tongues, but these ones speak and understand only Loross (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue"). They can also write in the Draconic script. *Professor Skant* can serve as a translator if none of the characters can understand the nothics.

The nothics have no memory of their lost humanity, and any information they might provide is garbled with bits of nonsense. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check can glean the following information from the nothics after a brief conversation:

- Iriolarthas, a powerful Netherese archwizard, watches over Ythryn. He has lost not only his mind, but most of his body as well. All that remains of him is a floating human skull.
- Giant floating hands made of magical force wander around in the city.
- Ythryn's *mythallar* won't function properly as long as the SpindleÃ¢ÂÂa powerful artifact dating back 40,000 yearsÃ¢ÂÂremains in the city. The artifact is located within the city's central spire.
- One must perform a ritual to enter Ythryn's central spire. (The nothics don't remember how the ritual works, but they do recall that clues can be found in the towers of wizardry scattered throughout the city.)
- Somewhere in Ythryn is a scroll that can summon the tarrasque.

#### H38. Ice Caves

Although these caves are empty, one or more of them might contain a psychic haunting (see "Psychic Hauntings").

The caves have 20-foot-high ceilings and slippery floors.

#### H39. Passage to Ythryn

This tunnel of ice cuts through the glacier for almost a mile before ending at the great ice cavern that contains Ythryn, described in *chapter 7*.

***Slaad Host.*** If one of the characters has the Slaad Host secret (see appendix B) and the **slaad tadpole** hasn't been born or destroyed yet, it bursts from the character's chest as the character descends this tunnel.

## Wrapping Up

Once the characters enter area H39, they can make their way deeper inside the Reghed Glacier, where the lost city of Ythryn awaits.

### Avarice Follows

Guided by the visions of Levistus, **Avarice** follows the characters to the Reghed Glacier. Around the time when the characters reach Ythryn, the tiefling wizard and her followers arrive at the Caves of Hunger and kill any Elk Tribe warriors guarding the entrance. **Avarice** then leads her troupe through the icy caverns, marching toward her destiny.

More information about **Avarice** and her followers is provided in the next chapter.

### Tekeli-li Escapes

If the characters do not slay Tekeli-li, the gnoll vampire leaves the Caves of Hunger in mist form and makes its way across the sunless tundra, eventually finding an ample food supply in Ten-Towns.

------

# Chapter 7: Doom of Ythryn

Ythryn rests in the silent depths of the Reghed Glacier. Ice encloses the enclave on all sides, yet the magic imbued in its stonework shields it from utter destruction. Ythryn is now a corpse cityÃ¢ÂÂa tomb for those who perished here and a death trap for those who dare to explore its ruined, glaciated halls.

![Ythryn is haunted by nothics who were once powerful netherese spellcasters](img/adventure/IDRotF/177-07-000.intro-splash.webp)

## Running This Chapter

Before running your first game session in the necropolis, review the "Iriolarthas the Demilich" and "The Fall of Ythryn" sections below, as well as the "Dealing with the Arcane Brotherhood" and "Auril's Wrath" sections at the end of the chapter.

### Character Advancement

Ideally, the characters are 9th level when they first arrive at Ythryn. You decide how quickly they advance in level. Treat the following as suggestions:

- The characters gain a level after overcoming the challenges of all eight towers of magic (areas Y4, Y7, Y11, Y18, Y20, Y22, Y24, and Y26).
- The characters gain a level when they reach Iriolarthas's study (area Y19q).
- The characters gain a level if they accomplish something extraordinary, such as destroying Iriolarthas the demilich, all three of Auril's forms, or the obelisk in area Y21.

If you follow the suggestions above, the characters could be as high as 12th level by the adventure's conclusionÃ¢ÂÂan important consideration if you intend to continue the campaign beyond this adventure.

### Iriolarthas the Demilich

Iriolarthas, once a powerful lich and before that a human wizard of Netheril, exists today as a demilich that haunts the ruins of Ythryn. Iriolarthas endures as a deteriorating skull that drifts about the necropolis in lonely despair. Wispy symbols of the eight schools of magic form above it and quickly dissipate.

A demilich is what becomes of a lich that neglects to feed souls into its phylactery, and Iriolarthas's phylactery has been empty for nearly two thousand years, buried under the rubble of Ythryn far from the demilich's reach. Having lost its body and its spellcasting abilities, the demilich holds out hope that other Netherese wizards will come to its rescue, unaware that the Empire of Netheril no longer exists. Though it has been trapped in Ythryn under the ice for centuries, the demilich has a very poor sense of how much time has passed.

When confronted by new arrivals, the demilich assumes they are rescuers from another Netherese enclave and watches to see what they do. The demilich has no means of communication and can't be contacted telepathically, so it judges new arrivals in silence. Characters who observe Iriolarthas and succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check can ascertain that the demilich is watching them closely to see how they react to their surroundings. If the demilich concludes, based on its observations, that the characters are not a rescue team from another Netherese enclave, it tries to destroy them before they can steal any of Ythryn's secrets. The same is true of invasive NPCs such as members of the Arcane Brotherhood. A party can fool the demilich into thinking they belong in Ythryn by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Deception) group check. If the group check is successful, Iriolarthas believes the party is what it pretends to be; on a failed group check, the demilich sees through the party's deception and becomes hostile toward the characters. If the demilich thinks that the characters are rescuers, given how they appear and act, it follows them around until something happens to change its mind.

Although it lacks the means to communicate, the demilich dimly recalls the circumstances that led to its present situation.

### The Fall of Ythryn

After using the *Ythryn mythallar* (see *appendix D*) to lift the enclave of Ythryn into the sky, Iriolarthas and his apprentices traveled to the frozen north in search of relics of Ostoria, a bygone empire of magic-wielding giants that waged war against the dragons forty thousand years earlier. After many fruitless excavations, they found a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice and brought it back to Ythryn for study in the fall of Ã¢ÂÂ343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow. During one of their experiments, something went wrongÃ¢ÂÂa flash of power from the spindle caused the *Ythryn* *mythallar* to shut down, which in turn caused the city to fall out of the sky and crash into the ice below.

The inhabitants of Ythryn had only a few moments to react as the city fell. Iriolarthas conjured a doorway to a magical demiplane and stepped through it just in time. As Ythryn settled into its icy grave, all magic in the city became undone for a brief time, as though something was trying to siphon it all away. The demiplane expelled Iriolarthas in that instant, trapping the lich in Ythryn, and became a living demiplane (see *appendix C*). Iriolarthas searched the ruins of the city for his spellbook and his phylactery, recovering only the former. He also found several magical servants in stasis that had survived the devastation, as well as a handful of apprentices who had used their spells in ingenious ways to escape death.

Some of those inside tried to flee Ythryn, but glacial ice blocked all conventional routes of escape, and attempts to leave by magic were thwarted by a troublesome intercessor: the mysterious spindle in Iriolarthas's citadel was still putting out magical pulses of energy to hinder spellcasting. By the time this disruption stopped some fifty years later, fear and madness had warped the minds of the apprentice mages, transforming them into nothics. Meanwhile, Iriolarthas grew increasingly feeble until, finally, the lich's skeletal body turned to dust.

> ##### Fate of Netheril
>
>The Empire of Netheril arose more than five thousand years ago. Those who follow the Dalereckoning calendar would place the date of Netheril's birth at Ã¢ÂÂ3859 DR.
>
>The Netherese legacy began with the discovery of the *Nether Scrolls*. These long, golden scrolls taught Netherese arcanists how to wield magic beyond their wildest fantasies. It took centuries, but the Netherese who mastered the power of the *Nether Scrolls* became a ruling class, living on great flying cities or taking refuge in remote, subterranean lairs.
>
>Despite their great power, the Netherese faced a growing threat. Under the heart of their empire lived spellcasting aberrations called phaerimm. Using their ability to drain magic, the phaerimm began to unravel the Weave, without which Netheril would collapse into ruin. In Ã¢ÂÂ339 DR, four years after the fall of Ythryn, the empire's most powerful arcanist, Karsus, attempted to neutralize the phaerimm threat by casting a spell of unparalleled power that would enable him to replace Mystryl as the god of magic, giving him absolute control over the Weave. Mystryl countered Karsus at a key moment during the casting of the spell, a feat she could accomplish only by sacrificing herself and tearing the Weave. Karsus was slain instantly, and for a time thereafter, most of the creatures of the world were either without magic or simply unable to control it.
>
>Without great magic to keep them aloft, the remaining flying cities of Netheril crashed to the ground, and many arcanists who survived were driven mad. Once magic came back into use, Netherese arcanists could no longer cast their mightiest spells as they had before, forcing them to resort to traditional wizardry. Four hundred years after Karsus cast his spell, the Netherese empire was no moreÃ¢ÂÂcrushed by its enemies and undone by its own hubris.
>
>In the Forgotten Realms, Netheril is the definitive lost empire. It rose to unparalleled heights but eventually fell into ruin. If you've ever played a science fiction game that includes the concept of a lost, highly advanced civilization, then you can begin to imagine what ancient Netheril must have been like. Out of this empire came many of the fearsome monsters, bizarre dungeons, and wondrous magic items found in FaerÃÂ»n today.
>

## Necropolis of Ythryn

When the characters arrive at Ythryn, read:

>>The tunnel opens into a vast grotto enclosed by gleaming ice. Consigned to this frozen sepulcher is a fantastic city sculpted by ancient magic and illuminated in a haunting way by green and purple lights that shed no warmth. The city is slightly tilted, its spires leaning away from you as though recoiling from your presence.
>>
>>You stand atop a causeway of frost-covered ice that stretches toward the city like the dead, frozen tongue of some hideous behemoth out of whose mouth you've just stepped.
>>

Show your players map 7.1. Permission is granted to photocopy this player-friendly map of the necropolis for home game use. Map 7.2 is the DM's version of the same map. Because the city is magically lit, the characters can see almost all of it from their vantage point on the ice bridge.

Most of the city's buildings are swathed in ice and ruined by time. Many of its districts were pulverized when Ythryn plunged from the sky, and the rest have fallen into disrepair in the centuries since. Use the information below to add life to this accursed city of the dead.

![Map 7.2: Necropolis of Ythryn](img/adventure/IDRotF/178-map-7.1-the-necropolis.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/179-map-7.1-the-necropolis-player.webp)
### Denizens of the Necropolis

Ythryn is home to many threats. Its most important denizens are summarized below:

- The demilich Iriolarthas dwells in the central spire (area Y19) but can be encountered anywhere in the necropolis.
- Mages who survived Ythryn's fall but succumbed to the arcane blight (see "Magical Effects" below) became nothics that speak Loross instead of Undercommon (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue" sidebar).
- Immortal servants known as magen (see appendix C) tirelessly perform their duties or wait in silence for new orders.
- Deadly living spells (see *appendix C*) guard a handful of locations in the city.

#### Random Encounters

After each hour the characters spend exploring the city, or each time the characters conduct a thorough search of an unnumbered building on the map, roll percentile dice and consult the Ythryn Encounters table to determine if the party has a random encounter. Some random encounters have variants if **Avarice** or Auril is present in the necropolis (see "Dealing with the Arcane Brotherhood" and "Auril's Wrath" at the end of the chapter).

##### Ythryn Encounters

### Magical Effects

The following magical effects are present throughout the necropolis:

- *Continual flame* spells illuminate street lamps as well as building interiors and exteriors.
- A powerful enchantment stabilizes gravity so that creatures stand upright even though the city rests at an angle. This enchantment extends over the enclave in a hemisphere whose ceiling is 800 feet high.
- Humanoids who remain in the necropolis for too long are likely to contract an arcane blight (see below).

#### Arcane Blight

Any humanoid that spends 12 hours in the necropolis must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract an arcane blight. This magical disease transforms the humanoid into a **nothic**, but only after the victim experiences hallucinations and feelings of isolation and paranoia. Other symptoms include clammy skin, hair loss, and myopia (nearsightedness).

A player character infected with the arcane blight gains the following flaw: "I don't trust anyone." This flaw, which supersedes any conflicting flaw, is fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.

Whenever it finishes a long rest, an infected humanoid must repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for future saves against the arcane blight drops by 1d6. If the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature overcomes the arcane blight and becomes immune to the effect of further exposure. A creature that fails three of these saving throws transforms into a **nothic** under the DM's control. Only a *wish* spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.

A *greater restoration* spell or similar magic ends the infection on the target, removing the flaw and all other symptoms, but this magic doesn't protect the target against further exposure.

#### Rite of the Arcane Octad

To pass through the force field that surrounds the Spire of Iriolarthas (area Y19) and the *Ythryn mythallar* (area Y23), one must perform the Rite of the Arcane Octad on the spire's doorstep (area Y6). To learn this ritual, the party must explore eight locations in the city and translate the inscriptions found therein. Once the inscriptions are translated and assembled in order, the eight steps of the ritual become clear:

- **Step 1.** Hold a wand crafted from the Nether Oak over your heart.
- **Step 2.** Summon a flame in your palm.

***Step 3.*** Speak a secret about yourself aloud. (The secrets in *appendix B* might come into play here and in step 4.)

- **Step 4.** Compel another to share a secret with you.
- **Step 5.** Quench the flame in ice.
- **Step 6.** Mask your appearance.
- **Step 7.** Draw a circle on the ground using the ashes of a corpse.
- **Step 8.** Stand inside the circle and consume poison.

This ritual was designed to test visitors' magical aptitude but can be performed without casting spells. For example, an adventurer could light a handful of lamp oil to "summon a flame" (taking 1 fire damage in the process). Any creature that performs all eight steps of the ritual in the correct order outside the spire can pass through the force field thereafter.

### Exploring the Ruins

As the characters explore the necropolis, call the players' attention to any numbered locations their characters can see; these are typically the most intact buildings. Unless the players say otherwise, assume that the characters explore at a cautious rate of 200 feet every 5 minutes.

Searching an unnumbered location takes 30 minutes and requires a check for random encounters. Roll once on the Ythryn Treasures table to determine if the characters find anything of value in the location.

### Ythryn Lore

As the characters explore Ythryn, they piece together a picture of what life was like in the enclave. Whenever a location instructs you to reveal some of Ythryn's lore, roll a d20 and refer to the Ythryn Lore table. If you get a result that's come up before, roll again or choose a different result.

##### Ythryn Lore
| d20 | Lore                                                                                                                                                           |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Ythryn was under the command of a lich named Iriolarthas. He was obsessed with finding relics and magic from FaerÃÂ»n's ancient past.                            |
|  2  | Ythryn was governed by a group of eight arcanists known as the Wizards of the Ebon Star. Their names and faces are immortalized in the city's museum.          |
|  3  | The city's creators used giant mimics as construction tools and beasts of burden.                                                                              |
|  4  | Apprentice mages would graduate from the House of the Arcane and join one of eight arcane towers, each one dedicated to a different school of magic.           |
|  5  | The wizards of Ythryn were entertained by a competitive sport called Chain Lightning.                                                                          |
|  6  | Every wizard in the enclave was obliged to carve their own wand from the Nether Oak at the heart of the arboretum.                                             |
|  7  | Ythryn was held aloft by the magic of an arcane sphere known as a mythallar. The mythallar also had the power to recharge magic items and control the weather. |
|  8  | Ythryn's mages could extend their lives indefinitely by preserving their brains inside jars.                                                                   |
|  9  | Wonders from across the world of Toril were sold at the enclave's Bazaar of the Bizarre.                                                                       |
|  10 | The city's elite wore robes of silk that displayed shifting, illusory patterns.                                                                                |
|  11 | Many of the city's residents owned strange chimeric pets, with winged hares and venomous baboons being particularly popular.                                   |
|  12 | The members of Ythryn's orchestra were known across the world of Toril as masters of their art.                                                                |
|  13 | By law, every mage was taught the *prestidigitation* cantrip and was obliged to use it to keep the city clean.                                                 |
|  14 | The wizards used humanlike constructs called magen as guards, workers, and valets. These constructs were created using a powerful spell.                       |
|  15 | The wizards imbued certain spells with their own life force, turning them into living entities.                                                                |
|  16 | The wizards of Ythryn were on a mission to find relics and ruins of Ostoria, a 40,000-year-old empire of spellcasting giants.                                  |
|  17 | In times of trouble, the wizards raised a force field around the enclave's central spire that only they could pass through.                                    |
|  18 | An *abracadabrus* is a magic box that can create food and drink, among other things.                                                                           |
|  19 | Meditation in the Hall of Weightless Wonder was an invaluable pursuit for the city's elite.                                                                    |
|  20 | An ancient obelisk stands in the shadow of the Spire of Iriolarthas. Using this obelisk and a *staff of power*, one can turn back time.                        |

## Necropolis of Ythryn Locations

### Necropolis Locations (Y1-Y9)

The following locations are keyed to map 7.2, which is the DM's version of the necropolis map.

#### Y1. Ice Causeway

Characters can use this naturally formed causeway of solid ice to enter the city. As the characters approach the end of the causeway, read:

>>Green and purple lights cast an otherworldly glow upon the frost draping the silent city. Clawing spires, broken domes, and steeples leaning at odd angles surround a huge citadel.
>>
>>At the foot of the causeway, a giant statue lies prone and motionless, its surfaces gleaming with rime.
>>

The city's dominating feature is the Spire of Iriolarthas (area Y19), which is sealed inside a magical force field.

***Dead Tomb Tapper.*** The statue at the end of the causeway is a 21-foot-tall tomb tapper (see *appendix C*) that was killed by drow invaders less than a tenday ago. The tomb tapper chased the drow to this point before they finally killed it. (The characters might have encountered the drow already in *chapter 6*.) The tomb tapper looks like a faceless, misshapen giant. It turned to stone when it died, leaving behind its big sledgehammer.

#### Y2. Wizard Spires

Several crooked spires branch off the enclave's perimeter wall, with bridges leading to their entrances. If a character approaches one of these outer towers, read:

>>A stone walkway leads to a tower that claws upward and inward, its pointed roof leaning menacingly overhead. Narrow windows pierce its walls, gargoyles cling to its eaves, and a doorway at the tower's base gapes open.
>>

Two of the outer spires have broken off. One crashed in Icewind Dale (see chapter 2), and the other is buried elsewhere in the glacier (see *chapter 6*). The remaining twelve spires are intact, though two are almost buried in ice. There is a 20 percent chance per tower that 1d3 + 1 **gargoyles** cling to the outside of it. (The other gargoyles clinging to the tower are inanimate statues.) Living gargoyles swoop down to attack anyone who crosses the gantry approaching the tower.

These towers were once occupied by mages and contained laboratories, libraries, and living quarters. Now they lie in ruins. *Map 2.10* gives you an idea of how the interior of each spire is laid out.

#### Y3. Chain Lightning Stadium

>>The air around this amphitheater is charged with static. Cracked steps descend to the stadium floor, where a tiny glittering object rests on a pedestal of black stone. Three metal masts rise from the arena like gigantic tridents, each one emitting a low hum. The branches of each trident are twenty-five feet off the ground and extend fifty feet into the air.
>>

A sport called Chain Lightning was played in this stadium. This event, which pitted mortals against each other in an electrified arena, enjoyed great popularity. An ornate trophy cup sits on a pedestal at one end of the arena floor, held in place by magic.

At ground level, the oval arena is 120 feet long and 50 feet across at its widest point. The three masts are 100 feet tall, spaced 40 feet apart, and emit electrical fields.

***Triggering the Game.*** The first time a creature steps onto the playing field, a dome of crackling electricity encloses the entire stadium. Nothing can physically pass through this barrier, which is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by *dispel magic*. The barrier also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Any creature that touches the barrier for the first time on a turn takes 40 (9d8) lightning damage. When the barrier appears, read:

>>The shimmering head and shoulders of a woman blink into existence above the arena floor. Electrical currents course over her metal teeth, and her form stutters and flickers as she speaks in a strange language.
>>

The illusory visage speaks in Loross, the dead language of Netheril (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue" sidebar). It says, "So, a new challenger enters the arena! You have thirty seconds to choose your teammates for a game of Chain Lightning!"

The illusory figure disappears after making its announcement, and adventurers on the playing field have thirty seconds to round out their team of six. Any spaces left over on the team are filled by obedient **galvan magen** (see appendix C) in black garments. The rival team is composed of six **galvan magen** in white garments. All these magen are magically summoned to the field.

The rules of Chain Lightning are summarized in the accompanying sidebar. If the characters aren't familiar with the rules, they have disadvantage on all skill checks made to play the game. (A written copy of the game's rules can be found in area Y9.) When the game ends, the electrical barrier enclosing the stadium vanishes, and the trophy levitates from its pedestal and drifts over to the member of the winning team nearest to it. The game can't be played again until a new trophy of similar value is placed upon the pedestal.

If an all-magen team wins the game, the winners collect their prize and disappear, taking the trophy with them.

***Treasure.*** The trophy can't be removed from its pedestal until it is won. If a creature tries to move the trophy before then, the pedestal discharges a bolt of lightning that deals 18 (4d8) lightning damage to the creature. The trophy cup is made from mithral embedded with three blue spinel gemstones and is worth 1,800 gp. While carried by a member of the winning team, it functions as a *stone of good luck*.

> ##### Chain Lightning
>
>Chain Lightning is a game in which two teams of six players compete against each other. To win, a team must eliminate the other team's players by hitting them with a 3-inch-diameter iron ball. A player struck by the thrown ball is eliminated and teleported to the sidelines. The game ends when all of one team's players have been eliminated.
>
>When the game begins, an iron ball magically appears in a random location on the arena floor roughly equidistant from the two teams. The ball is a simple ranged weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. Its range is 120 feet, and it deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
>
>To simulate a game of Chain Lightning, follow these steps:
>
>***Step 1.*** Every player makes a Dexterity (Athletics) check. The individual with the highest roll gets the ball, and that person's team is on offense. Resolve a tie with a Strength (Athletics) contest.

>***Step 2.*** To simulate the ball being passed around, every player makes a DC 15 Dexterity (Athletics) check. If the team on offense gets more successes than the team on defense, one player on offense can try either to hurl the ball between the metal tines of an electrified mast, hoping to impart an electrical charge to the ball, or make a ranged weapon attack with the ball against a player on defense. Each option is described below:

>- Hurling the ball between the tines of an electrified mast requires a successful ranged attack roll against AC 15. If this attack hits, the ball becomes electrically charged as it passes between the tines. Repeat step 1 to determine which team gets custody of the electrically charged ball.
>- If the ball is thrown at a player on defense and it hits, the player struck by the ball is eliminated. If the ball is electrically charged when it hits, it deals an additional 3 (1d6) lightning damage to the eliminated player, and an arc of lightning shoots from the ball and automatically hits another randomly determined player on the same team. This second player takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage and is also eliminated. If the ball is thrown at a player and it misses, it loses its electrical charge if it has one. Repeat step 1 to determine which team gets custody of the ball.

>***How to Win.*** Repeat step 2 until one team has eliminated all the players on the other team.

#### Y4. Tower of Abjuration

>>This tower reaches upward like a talon, its stonework studded in chiseled runes. A blue light shines from its highest window.
>>

A *detect magic* spell cast here reveals an aura of abjuration magic. Runes cover every inch of this tower's exterior. A glyph for the *symbol* (insanity) spell is hidden among them. A character who searches the outside of the tower for traps finds and identifies the glyph with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The glyph triggers when a creature steps through the tower's entrance and resets after 24 hours.

Once inside, the characters can ascend to the top of the tower. When they arrive there, read:

>>A huge anvil chiseled with vivid blue runes rests in the center of a thirty-foot-diameter, thirty-foot high circular chamber. Resting atop it is a hammer adorned with matching runes.
>>
>>Six armored figures stand guard around the anvil. At the rear of the chamber, the frozen corpse of a wizard lies in a pile of rubble. Blue flames flicker from braziers spaced around the room, illuminating a carved inscription on the ceiling.
>>

Six **demos magen** (see appendix C) guard the anvil, which has the power to destroy other magic items. The anvil was a source of vexation for Ythryn's tomb tappers, which believe magic items to be sacred. When Ythryn collapsed, the protective wards surrounding the tower unraveled, and one of the tomb tappers seized the opportunity to kill the anvil's creator, High Abjurer Taruth. The wizard's mauled body lies in this chamber, the stony floor next to him broken where the tomb tapper forced its way into the room. The magen won't let anyone use the anvil and fight to defend it.

***Anvil of Disjunction.*** The anvil has the power to destroy any magic item that isn't an artifact. When a character holds the anvil's hammer for the first time, a voice inside their head, seeming to come from the anvil, says, "Bring me your items of power, and together we shall destroy them." To destroy an item, the character must place it on the anvil and strike it three times with the hammer. Each hammer strike takes one action. On the third strike, the item disintegrates in a flash of blue light. Every time a character uses the anvil, there is a 25 percent chance that a **tomb tapper** (see *appendix C*) burrows its way into the tower to attack them (this happens only once). The anvil is anchored here and cannot be moved by any means. Removing the hammer from the tower causes it to teleport atop the anvil.

***Inscription.*** The inscription on the ceiling is in Draconic and reads "First, shield thy heart with a wand from the Nether Oak." This is a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad").

#### Y5. Prison

A portcullis sits askew in the 40-foot-wide, 30-foot-tall archway that serves as the only entrance to this square building. Characters who pass beneath the portcullis find themselves in a mostly abandoned prison:

>>A maze of cell-lined corridors fills this area.
>>

All the cell doors, which have *arcane lock* spells cast on them, are made of iron, with small, barred windows set into them at eye level. Many of the cells contain the frozen bodies of prisoners who died when Ythryn crashed or who perished from starvation not long afterward.

***Infirmary.*** If the characters spend at least 30 minutes searching the prison, they stumble upon an infirmary:

>>Peering through the gap in a collapsed wall, you see a fifteen-foot-square infirmary in disarray, with an operating table in the middle of the room. Leather straps extend from one side of the table, into the air above its surface, and fasten to the other side. The shape suggests that something or someone invisible is lashed to the table.
>>

Strapped to the table is a **doppelganger** named Xerophon. It has been rendered invisible and placed in a state of suspended animation by a *sequester* spell. The spell can be dispelled (DC 17), which renders Xerophon visible and awake. The doppelganger looks like a thin, middle-aged man with a sallow complexion, one blue eye and one green eye, and a streak of silver in his long, jet-black hair. The awake doppelganger can use its action to try to slip free of the table's leather straps, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, or a character can use an action to loosen the straps enough for Xerophon to get free.

Shortly before the fall of Ythryn, Xerophon murdered a Netherese sage in the city, stole his identity, and tried to infiltrate the Spire of Iriolarthas. The doppelganger was caught and imprisoned. The prison warden, a Netherese wizard, was interested in studying the doppelganger and perhaps developing a potion that emulated its shapeshifting ability. The wizard made Xerophon acquiesce to a series of experiments, and in between cast *sequester* spells on the doppelganger as a precaution to keep it from escaping.

If questioned, Xerophon speaks Loross but switches to Common if no one in the party understands the dead Netherese tongue. The doppelganger plays the part of a low-born Netherese manservant who was sent to the prison by his master, Iriolarthas, for disobedience. Without going into much detail, Xerophon alludes to horrible magical experiments performed on prisoners by the wizard who ran the prison, saying, "I was afraid I might be next."

Once it realizes the fate that has befallen Ythryn, Xerophon offers to help the characters search the rest of the city, allowing the doppelganger time to use its Read Thoughts ability to glean all the information it can from the characters' minds. After all, it has a lot of catching up to do. The doppelganger has no ill intentions toward the characters but places self-preservation above all else.

If the characters befriend Xerophon, they learn three facts from the Ythryn Lore table, which Xerophon shares to build trust. The doppelganger also knows that to bypass the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, one must perform the eight steps of the Rite of the Arcane Octad outside the spire. The steps of the ritual are hidden inside towers dedicated to the eight arcane schools of magic. Xerophon knows the layout of the city and can lead the party to each of these towers (areas Y4, Y7, Y11, Y18, Y20, Y22, Y24, and Y26).

#### Y6. Spire Entrance

>>An arching strut of dark stone rises from this ruined district to a junction high up on the central spire. A gate engraved with arcane sigils is set into the base of the strut.
>>

The Spire of Iriolarthas (area Y19) is surrounded by a force field that also encompasses this area. Creatures can't pass through the field, nor can they teleport to a location inside it. To pass through the force field, one must perform the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad") in front of the gate.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the sigils on the gate as ancient symbols representing the eight schools of magic.

***Magic Elevator.*** Characters who can pass through the force field can open the gate and enter the strut, which is hollow and encloses a steep passage. Any creature that enters this elevator is magically levitated to the spire entrance (area 19a).

#### Y7. Tower of Conjuration

>>This tower is engraved with interlocking circles of stone. Yellow light spills from its topmost window, and the faint sound of brooms brushing on stonework drifts through its broken doors.
>>

A *detect magic* spell cast here reveals an aura of conjuration magic. The tower's interior is ruined but surprisingly clean, thanks to permanent *unseen servant* spells that continuously sweep the floors. If the characters ascend to the topmost chamber of the tower, read:

>>Glowing orbs are set into the walls of this thirty-foot-diameter circular chamber. Four giant hands made of shimmering force hover in the center of the room, guarding a tiny ornamental tower perched on a pedestal.
>>

The hovering hands are four **living Bigby's hands** (see *appendix C*) that attack any other creature that enters the room.

***Hidden Tower.*** Touching the miniature tower while it is inside this chamber conjures a glowing doorway to a demiplane. The doorway is 8 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet away from the pedestal.

If a character steps through the doorway, the fabric of reality warps and bends around them as they arrive in the demiplane: a cluttered den 40 feet long and 20 feet wide. Occupying this extradimensional den are three **night hags** named Auntie Pinch, Auntie Pillage, and Auntie Plunder. This coven frequently leaves its den to roam the Ethereal Plane in search of treasure chests tucked away using the *Leomund's secret chest* spell; however, all three hags are home when the characters arrive.

In addition to their innate spellcasting abilities, the hags have the Shared Spellcasting ability of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the *Monster Manual*). The hags are prepared to let the characters leave alive in return for a simple price: a single memory plucked from each character's mind. The hags flee their lair in ethereal form if attacked, vowing to return and seek vengeance in the adventurers' dreams.

***Inscription.*** An inscription in Draconic is written on the wall of the hags' den. It reads "Second, summon a flame in the palm of your hand." This is a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad.

***Treasure.*** The night hags keep their heartstones and soul bags on their persons (see the "Night Hag Items" sidebar in the *Monster Manual*).

Characters who ransack the hag's den find a platinum needle (1 gp) stuck in a pincushion, a pink quartz figurine of a rabbit (50 gp), a silver necklace from which hangs a crow's-foot pendant grasping a peridot (500 gp), a *potion of invisibility* in a stoppered vial made from a witch's fingerbone, and a *potion of longevity* in a hollow gourd that bears a child's face locked in a scream.

![Auntie Pinch, Auntie Pillage, and Auntie Plunder are open for business](img/adventure/IDRotF/181-07-002.webp)

#### Y8. House of the Arcane

>>Eight tusk-like towers are embedded in the walls of this monumental building, their spires arching over its shattered roof.
>>

This grand academy was a place of study for novice mages, where each one learned which schools of magic would become their life's work. The place is easily entered through any of the gaping holes in its outer walls. Nothing can be salvaged from the study halls and the towers, but the auditorium holds something of interest:

>>Eight stained glass windows overlook a ruined auditorium. Benches glistening with frost are arrayed in broken rows, facing a raised lectern. A bejeweled goblet rests on the lectern. Steam rises from the goblet's contents and dissipates in the cold air.
>>

Each window in the auditorium depicts a wizard casting a spell from one of the eight schools of magic. The spells depicted are *blade ward* (abjuration), *mage hand* (conjuration), *true strike* (divination), *friends* (enchantment), *dancing lights* (evocation), *minor illusion* (illusion), *chill touch* (necromancy), and *prestidigitation* (transmutation), all of which a character can determine with a single successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

***Magic Goblet.*** The goblet is embedded with eight colored crystals that represent the eight schools of magic. The liquid inside it looks and tastes like hot water. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic on the goblet and indicates that the liquid carries auras of all eight schools of magic. The liquid isn't poisonous or harmful, and it never runs dry as long as the goblet remains in the auditorium.

A humanoid that drinks from the goblet gains a supernatural charm (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). Roll a d8 and consult the Magic Goblet Charms table to determine which charm is bestowed. Each charm grants its recipient the power to cast a particular spell, for which Intelligence is the spellcasting ability. The recipient becomes aware of this power as soon as the charm is bestowed. Each charm also has a secret magical effect that triggers when the charm's benefit expires; do not reveal this secret to a player before the effect occurs.

Once a creature has gained a charm from the goblet, it cannot gain another one by drinking from the goblet again.

#### Y9. Library

>>This colossal building has many lofty turrets in a state of disrepair, the ground below littered with their rubble. A giant-sized door at the base of the structure stands slightly ajar.
>>

Shelves line the walls of this labyrinthine library, which is crammed with books on every conceivable subject.

***Arcanaloth Book Hunter.*** Soon after the adventurers enter, a bespectacled, jackal-headed humanoid paces into view carrying a bundle of scrolls. An eyeless, white, 5-foot-tall penguin in a leather harness shuffles behind it, dragging a small cart laden with books. The jackal-headed figure lets out a joyful gasp when it sees the characters and says, "Ah, you must be the librarians! Scrivenscry has need of your assistance." The penguin shifts uneasily as its master speaks.

Scrivenscry is an **arcanaloth** who always refers to itself in the third person. It has a fondness for black licorice, strips of which it keeps in the pockets of its robe. The fiend is attended by **Kingsport**, a blind, albino giant penguin under the effect of an *awaken* spell.

Scrivenscry insists that the characters help it search for the *Books of Keeping* (see the "Scrivenscry and **Kingsport**" sidebar). If the characters engage Scrivenscry in conversation, **Kingsport** chooses a moment to approach the nearest character and pass a note to them. Scratched into a piece of leather are the words "Help me" in Common, which **Kingsport** wrote using his beak.

The characters must evade, defeat, or strike a deal with Scrivenscry if they want to rescue the penguin. If outmatched in combat, Scrivenscry teleports into the depths of the library and plots its revenge. Characters who agree to cooperate with the arcanaloth soon find themselves alone with **Kingsport**, who reveals that Scrivenscry is a cruel and wicked master. Neither **Kingsport** nor his master knows much about Ythryn, since they arrived only yesterday by using a *spell scroll* of *plane shift*.

> ##### Scrivenscry and Kingsport
>
>Scrivenscry is a vainglorious arcanaloth who roams the planes in search of the *Books of Keeping*, four lost tomes that hold the true names of every yugoloth ever created. The fiend stumbled on Ythryn's library by chance and is convinced that at least one of the legendary tomes is hidden here. Alas, Scrivenscry is mistaken.
>
>Scrivenscry's anxious penguin servant, **Kingsport**, was promised a life of enlightenment. The truth is that **Kingsport** was turned into Scrivenscry's lackey, who lives in fear of his cruel, unpredictable master. The blind giant penguin hopes to be free of the arcanaloth one day.
>

***Searching the Library.*** Characters who spend a few hours studying the books in the library learn 1d3 facts from the Ythryn Lore table. One of the tomes they examine is an almanac that lists past winners of the city's Chain Lightning tournament (see area area Y3). Characters who read this tome find a summary of the game's rules.

In addition, characters who search the library find a journal written by Thufeus, one of the few mages who survived Ythryn's crash. It describes how the city fell from the sky and the attempts of its doomed survivors to escape (see "The Fall of Ythryn"). The last entry reads "Iriolarthas is convinced that aid will come in time from Netheril. I am not so sure."

***Treasure.*** Scrivenscry carries three spell scrolls (*Leomund's tiny hut*, *plane shift*, and *wall of ice*) and a *chime of opening* with a single use remaining.

**Kingsport**'s cart contains six texts that Scrivenscry deems valuable. Each one is a treatise on the Outer Planes and is worth 250 gp to a collector of such works.

### Necropolis Locations (Y10-Y18)

#### Y10. Arboretum

>>A canopy of golden leaves crowns the trees inside a sunken basin. The trees grow in stark contrast to their bleak surroundings, their branches swaying even though the air is deathly still.
>>

The grove is nestled in a hollow in the city floor. Vents spaced around its perimeter wall emit puffy gray vapor, which rises above the treetops and disperses as rain. An illusory hemisphere above the arboretum projects a false sky; now malfunctioning, the vista flickers between a wild storm and a vast field of stars.

***Nether Oak.*** A tree called the Nether Oak grows at the heart of the arboretum. For centuries, Netherese mages crafted their wands and staffs from the wood of this oak. Saturated in profane magic, the tree developed a brooding sentience and a gnarly face. The Nether Oak uses the **treant** stat block but is neutral evil and speaks Common and Primordial.

When the characters arrive, the Nether Oak is in deep slumber. To complete the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad"), they must craft a wand from the wood of this tree. Gathering wood without waking the tree requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If the characters wake the tree, they can convince it to part with some of its wood with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, but only if it believes they intend to perform nefarious magic with it. The Nether Oak is easily angered and uproots itself if driven to combat. When it attacks, four **needle blights** spring from the ground to assist it, acting on the same initiative count.

#### Y11. Tower of Divination

>>The walls of this thin tower are etched with intricate designs of hands and eyes. Silver light flickers from a high window, above which a large, carved eye animates and blinks. Part of the tower's roof is missing.
>>

A *detect magic* spell cast here reveals an aura of divination magic. When the characters reach the top floor of the spire, read:

>>Large gashes in the roof allow you to see the dark, icicle-festooned roof of the great ice cavern beyond.
>>
>>Silver light emanates from a three-foot-diameter glass orb situated atop a two-foot-high cylindrical stone plinth in the center of a thirty-foot-diameter, rubble-strewn circular chamber. Eyeballs drift inside the orb, like fish in a bowl. Some have cataracts, while others are bloodshot or pus-filled, but all turn and gaze at you as you approach.
>>

Huge chunks of the walls have broken off in here, and the inscription bearing the divination passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad is missing.

With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check, a character recalls that a crystal ball filled with eyes is the symbol of Savras, god of divination.

***Orb of Divination.*** The stone plinth upon which the orb rests is engraved with instructions written in Draconic: "Ask and we shall find." To use the orb, one must place one's hands on it and speak the name of an object or a person. If the target exists on the same plane of existence as the orb, the character touching the orb experiences a vivid vision of the target's location and knows how far away it is and in what direction. Such insight, however, comes with a risk: a creature that receives a vision must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage as one of its eyes is magically plucked from its socket and teleported inside the orb (see "*Injuries*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for rules on losing an eye).

If asked for the whereabouts of the missing wall engraving needed to complete the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad"), the orb provides a vision of where it fell inside the observatory (area Y15). The orb is magically anchored to this chamber and cannot be removed or destroyed. The only limit to how many times it can be used is how many eyeballs the party has remaining.

#### Y12. Wellspring of Answers

>>A deep well plunges through the city floor into darkness. Five crystal benches encircle it, glinting under the purple glow of a nearby street lamp.
>>

The stone well is 100 feet deep and lined with slippery ice and frost, making it impossible to negotiate without climbing gear or magic. Months before Ythryn's fall, a circle of mages known as the **Telepathic Pentacle** tried to fuse their minds together to become a conjoined telepathic force. The procedure went terribly wrong, and their bodies and minds melded into a single monstrosity. Iriolarthas imprisoned the thing in this empty well so that its latent telepathic powers could be tapped by the city's elite. A short obituary is engraved around the lip of the well in Draconic: "Herein lie the immortal remains of the **Telepathic Pentacle**. Sit, meditate, and learn."

***Thing in the Well.*** A gibbering, five-headed aberration lies in a semiconscious state at the bottom of the well. The warped faces of the **Telepathic Pentacle** strain at the ends of its thick, undulating necks. The monster uses the **hydra** stat block, except that it has a climbing speed of 30 feet.

The monster shudders awake if a light source penetrates more than 80 feet into the well, or if a creature sitting on one of the benches awakens it (see below).

***Meditation Benches.*** By sitting on these crystal benches and meditating, citizens of Ythryn could join their minds with the **Telepathic Pentacle**, gaining insights about their past and future. A creature that sits on the bench can, after 1 minute of meditation, gain one clue from the Ythryn Lore table by making a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature's wayward thoughts awaken the thing in the well. A creature can gain only one insight from the well per day, and only while the monster is alive.

#### Y13. Bazaar of the Bizarre

>>A large market hall sits at one end of this plaza, its four broken towers leaning inward. Faded pennants hang above the entrance, frozen stiff. A loud clatter resounds from within the hall.
>>

This market hall once sold relics of arcane wonder. Now, its interior is a warren of mangled shop fronts crushed by chunks of ice and stone. Most of the wares have become worthless, and everything else has been destroyed by a headless **iron golem** that is presently rampaging around inside the building.

Without its head, the golem has the following changes to its statistics:

- The golem has 150 hit points (its hit point maximum). It has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP).
- It is blinded and deafened, giving it disadvantage on all its attack rolls, and it can't use its Poison Breath.

The golem was decapitated when Ythryn crashed into the Reghed Glacier. Its head wound up deep within the Caves of Hunger (see area H9 in *chapter 6*), and its body has been stomping around Ythryn ever since. The golem swings blindly at anything that attacks it.

#### Y14. Hall of Silk

>>Silken drapes hang from the walls of this storefront, their surfaces swirling with illusory images of dragon's fire and twinkling star fields. A group of emotionless figures stand guard outside, looking for all the world like frozen statues.
>>

Six **demos magen** (see appendix C) guard the entrance to this store. They attack anyone who tries to steal the silks on display (see "Treasure" below) but otherwise let strangers explore the store.

Inside the store, five **galvan magen** (see appendix C) watch over rest of the merchandise. More of the magic silk hangs in long drapes throughout the interior, after being spun by four **phase spiders** that lurk in the hall's rafters. The spiders are enchanted to produce sorcery silk, a material with illusions woven into it that was fashioned into robes for Ythryn's elite. Characters who enter the store spot the spiders immediately. The spiders defend themselves if attacked but are otherwise nonthreatening.

In the center of the interior, crystal mannequins draped in finery encircle an empty pedestal. If a creature steps onto the pedestal, an illusion of a magnificently dressed human flickers to life before them and introduces itself as Silksmith Mixyll. The illusion welcomes the guest to its emporium and explains the robe-making process. As it speaks, the phase spiders descend silently and use their legs to take the creature's measurements before spinning the creature a tailor-made robe. As the robe is being fashioned, Mixyll urges its guest to "imagine any image your heart desires." The spiders can, in the 10 minutes it takes to create the robe, spin any illusory design or effect into the garment. On completion, they drape the robe over the creature's shoulders and ascend back to their lair. Each guest can gain this benefit only once.

***Treasure.*** A silk robe spun by the spiders is worth 250 gp. If the characters ransack the store, they find ten other silk robes (250 gp each) that are on display and weren't damaged when the city crashed.

#### Y15. Observatory

>>This conical tower is held relatively upright by a ring of arched buttresses. Expressionless humanoid figures stand in silence around it. The roof has a large, ragged hole in it where something large smashed through.
>>

Three **galvan magen**, three **demos magen**, and one **hypnos magen** stand guard outside the observatory with orders to prevent strangers from entering it (see appendix C for their stat blocks). The hypnos magen telepathically orders intruders to leave the area. Defying this order prompts the magen to attack.

The iron door at the base of the observatory is welded shut from the outside and must be broken down. It has AC 19, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A **blue slaad** lurks on the other side of the doorway and attacks as soon as the door ceases to be an obstacle. This slaad is hostile toward all other creatures and can't be reasoned with.

Once inside, the characters can ascend the tower to its uppermost floor:

>>A large telescope dominates a thirty-foot-diameter circular chamber at the top of the tower. Gazing into the telescope's eyepiece is a hulking, frog-like biped in wizard's robes that pays you no mind as it mumbles to itself.
>>
>>Adamantine shields cover the observatory's windows. A large chunk of stone from another building has crashed through the roof and embedded itself in the floor like a jagged stone knife. This intruding fragment bears a strange inscription on one side.
>>

By training the magic telescope on distant stars, Ythryn's astronomers could summon alien creatures from those stars to be questioned, studied, or dissected. The fall of Ythryn damaged the telescope beyond repair, rendering it useless.

When Ythryn fell, a piece of the Tower of Divination (area Y11) crashed through the observatory roof (see "Inscription" below). In the resulting chaos, the blue slaad encountered on the tower's ground floor escaped from its cell and rampaged through the observatory. The Arch-Astronomer, who became infected by the slaad's chaos phage, ordered her surviving apprentices to seal her inside the tower with the monster. In the years, decades, and centuries since, she has managed to keep the blue slaad from escaping through the hole in the roof.

The Arch-Astronomer, now a **green slaad**, is madly fiddling with the telescope, hoping to reverse its power so that it can project itself out of the tower to some faraway place where it can find happiness, but it has no hope of success. If the characters interrupt the Arch-Astronomer, it tries to frighten them away by baring its teeth and claws. If they touch the telescope or damage it further, the slaad goes crazy and attacks them. If they merely want to read the inscription on the wall fragment that crashed through the roof, the slaad leaves them alone.

***Inscription.*** The chunk of wall from the Tower of Divination (area Y11) bears the following inscription in Draconic: "Third, a burnt palm loosens the tongue. Shed a secret about yourself for all to hear." This is a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad" ).

![A green slaad gazes into the eyepiece of Ythryn's telescope](img/adventure/IDRotF/183-07-003.green-slaad.webp)

#### Y16. Menagerie

>>An immense dome looms before you, its crystal roof marred by a web of cracks. Through the gaps in the building's shell, and on the other side of the open entranceway, you see a strange landscape of miniaturized natural features.
>>

This building's entrance lies unattended. Ythryn's mages would visit here to conjure up one-of-a-kind pets. Small-scale versions of natural habitats were constructed throughout the park: miniature mountain ranges, deserts, and forested streams, all now draped in ice. At the heart of this mixture of landscapes stands the machine that brought the menagerie's creatures into existence.

***Chimeric Creator.*** This device is a 10-foot-diameter iron wheel on its side, held above the ground by a metal brace, with eight barrel-sized, egg-shaped open containers attached to the outer ends of its spokes. The apparatus has a bronze control panel with a lever next to it. A character who spends at least 1 minute examining the device can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, the character gains an understanding of how to use it without knowing its purpose. To operate the device, 80 hit points of blood must be distributed evenly between its eight containers. Once the blood is properly deposited, pulling a lever causes the wheel to spin. The blood disappears 1 minute later, the wheel stops, and a creature crawls out of one of the containers. This creature is loyal to whoever pulled the lever. Determine the creature by rolling a d6 and consulting the Chimeric Creations table.

The chimeric creator needs 8 hours to recharge before it can be used again. A gauge on the device indicates how long it will take to recharge.

##### Chimeric Creations
|  d6 | Creature                                                                                                                              |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A **weasel** with glowing eyes that emit bright light out in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet                 |
|  2  | A **hare** (see *appendix C*) with feathered wings and a flying speed of 30 feet                                                      |
|  3  | A **baboon** with a bite attack that deals an extra 3 (1d6) poison damage on a hit                                                    |
|  4  | A **cat** with antennae that grant it blindsight and tremorsense out to a range of 60 feet                                            |
|  5  | A **rat** with gills, iridescent scales, and the ability to breathe air and water                                                     |
|  6  | A **fox** (see *appendix C*) with fur that changes color to match its surroundings, giving it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks |

#### Y17. Theater

>>The roof of this domed building is wrecked and open to the elements. Inside is a theater with a large stage, seating for more than one hundred, and a backstage area. Icicles hang from its sagging balconies, and rime-frosted masks leer and grin from its fractured walls.
>>

A wooden writing desk sits in a backstage room, wrapped in chains and padlocked. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock as an action, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. In a leather-bound folder in one of the desk drawers are five scripts for a play called *A Blasphemy of Kings*. The play tells the story of five siblings, each expecting to claim the throne of their late father. As the protagonists try to prove their worth, it is revealed that they're all in fact dead, having perished alongside their father in the cataclysmic event that destroyed their kingdom.

***Cursed Play.*** Each script has a different cover showing a humanoid figure that represents one of the siblings: the Martyr (with a noose around its neck), the Traitor (with a knife held behind its back), the Bewitched (with a fairy whispering in its ear), the Haunted (with a demonic shadow terrorizing it), and the Fool (performing a handstand). Each of the five scripts is cursed. Anyone who spends an hour reading a script must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. A creature cursed in this way is gripped by a sudden feeling of impending doom. Each of the five scripts imparts a different curse, which can be ended by a *remove curse* spell or similar magic:

- **Martyr's Script.** All attacks against the cursed character are made with advantage.
- **Traitor's Script.** The cursed character can't perform any action that would directly benefit one of their allies.
- **Bewitched's Script.** The cursed character hears the voice of an imaginary fey creature whispering in their ear. Whenever presented with a choice, the character must randomly determine what action to take.
- **Haunted's Script.** A shadowy fiend plagues the cursed character's dreams (or trances in the case of an elf), denying that character the benefits of a long rest.
- **Fool's Script.** The cursed character has disadvantage on all ability checks.

#### Y18. Tower of Necromancy

>>The remains of a toppled tower lie scattered around you. Its fractured base, protruding from the ground like a broken tooth, is teeming with crawling gray hands.
>>

A *detect magic* spell cast here reveals an aura of necromantic magic. Two hundred **crawling claws** are tirelessly but ineffectively trying to excavate the tower's ruins, brick by brick. Anyone who disrupts this effort is attacked by 2d6 claws. Deep under the rubble, the corpse of High Necromancer Cadavix lies crushed, yet his **ghost** remains behind to haunt the tower. Characters who linger in the area of the tower witness his gaunt spirit staring glumly down at the debris. Cadavix's ghost is harmless and attacks only in self-defense; it laments the fall of Ythryn and longs to see its corpse freed from the ruins.

Excavating the tower requires pickaxes and shovels, and it takes a number of hours equal to 50 divided by the number of excavators (minimum 1 hour). The crawling claws don't count as diggers, nor do they attack characters who join the digging effort. Quite the contrary: they get visibly excited as the unearthing of their master draws near. If Cadavix's frozen corpse is unearthed, his spirit is laid to rest and the claws scuttle off into the ruins. Those who find the corpse can claim its necklace (see "Treasure" below).

***Inscription.*** Characters who dig deep enough to reach Cadavix's corpse also reach the tower's foundations and uncover a section of wall that bears the following inscription in Draconic: "Seventh, trace a circle with the ashes of the dead." This is a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad").

***Treasure.*** Cadavix's corpse wears a *necklace of fireballs* with six beads remaining.

![Map 7.3: Spire of Iriolarthas](img/adventure/IDRotF/184-map-7.3-spire-of-iriolarthas.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/IDRotF/185-map-7.3-spire-of-iriolarthas-player.webp)
### Spire of Iriolarthas (Y19a-Y19q)

A shimmering force field surrounds this 1,200-foot-tall obsidian citadel, which rises from the center of Ythryn and dwarfs all neighboring structures. Creatures can't pass through it, nor can they teleport to any location inside it. Any creature that performs the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad") near the spire can pass through the force field in either direction thereafter.

The spire, the interior of which is shown in map 7.3, has the following recurring features:

**Demilich's Lair**. The spire is the lair of the **demilich** Iriolarthas. The lair actions noted in the demilich entry of the *Monster Manual* apply throughout the spire, though Iriolarthas can use lair actions only while inside it. The spire doesn't have demilich lair traits.

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings are 30 feet high inside rooms and 10 feet high in corridors.
- **Doors.** Doors are made from enchanted oak fitted with adamantine locks and hinges.
- **Lighting.** The interior of the spire is brightly lit by *continual flame* spells cast in wall sconces.

#### Y19a. Main Entrance

If the characters reach this area by ascending the strut at area Y6, read:

>>Near the apex of the strut, the ceiling of the tunnel gives way to a landing that offers a view of the citadel's uppermost reaches. Light from a high window illuminates a set of steps that ascend to a pair of mahogany doors in the tower's face.
>>

The magic that once sealed the doors has long since faded away. When visitors approach the doors, a **hypnos magen** (see appendix C) from area Y19d appears at the overlooking window and uses its telepathy to politely instruct the intruders to leave the area. If the intruders behave threateningly or ignore its warnings, the magen tries to drive them away using *suggestion* spells, or failing that, attacks them.

#### Y19b. Ballroom

>>Chamber music washes over you as you enter this ballroom. In contrast to the desolate, frozen ruins outside, a dozen people mill around in here, dressed in flowing silk garments and holding colorful hand masks and feathered fans. Noble courtiers laugh and gossip as servants move among them, offering sugared treats on silver platters.
>>

The music, people, food, decor, and warmth are illusions with which the characters can interact (see "Joining the Ball" below). The scene can be ended with a successful *dispel magic* spell (DC 19). If the illusory ball is dispelled, the room's true contents are revealed:

>>The ballroom lies in ruins, rimed with ice, its furniture jumbled and shattered. Above the floor where nobles danced, three glass cylinders with iron fittings slowly move through the air. Housed in each cylinder is a swollen human brain floating in a bath of slimy, translucent goo.
>>

Three Netherese wizards chose to continue their revels into undeath, each one becoming a **brain in a jar** (see *appendix C*). The three wizards have been driven mad by their undead existence. Dispelling the illusion drives them into a furious rage. Visitors who ruin the ball in any way are attacked.

***Joining the Ball.*** The characters can interact freely with the illusory surroundings. The magic reacts to their actions, allowing them to hold conversations with courtiers, join the dance, or even sample the canapes. All the illusory figments know nothing of Ythryn's fate and are interested only in revelry and gossip. Characters who spend at least 5 minutes talking to the illusory guests or servants learn one random fact from the Ythryn Lore table.

#### Y19c. Council Chambers

These chambers served as offices for bureaucrats who ran the citadel's day-to-day operations. Each room contains a single table, a cabinet filled with ruined parchment scrolls, and a dresser containing writing materials. Everything is in disarray and covered in ice.

Characters who search the northernmost chamber discover an unfinished letter that details the acquisition of an artifact dating back to the empire of Ostoria. This rune-carved stone spindle is described as having an unknown purpose. The writer notes that it has been moved to the citadel's stasis chamber for further study.

#### Y19d. Guard Passage

At the end of the passage to the west, a narrow window overlooks the steps that lead to the main entrance (area Y19a). Anyone who enters this passage is challenged by a **hypnos magen** (see appendix C)Ã¢ÂÂthe same one that tries to shoo away intruders in area Y19a. This magen emerges from a cramped sentry chamber to the east and uses telepathy to politely inform intruders that they are trespassing: if the intruders don't leave at once, the magen tries to forcibly eject them.

#### Y19e. Liquefaction Chamber

>>Shifting green, purple, and blue light spills into this room through a single window. Bolted-down tables hold an array of equipment: beakers of alchemical fluid, alembics, cut crystal needles, surgical tools, coiled leather tubes, and more. Behind the tables stands an ornate suit of armor. Where the head should be is a swollen human brain floating inside a canister of translucent fluid.
>>

![Veneranda](img/adventure/IDRotF/186-07-004.veneranda.webp)

This ritual room is designed to serve a grisly purpose: the transformation of a living creature into a brain in a jar. Veneranda, a neutral evil Netherese wizard, extracted her own brain to become a **brain in a jar** (see *appendix C*) that is affixed to the body of a headless **helmed horror**. If the characters threaten or attack her, Veneranda turns the helmed horror against the group and attacks. Even though they are conjoined, the brain in a jar and the helmed horror roll initiative separately and attack as separate creatures. The brain can detach from the helmed horror as a bonus action.

Unlike her companions in the ballroom (area Y19b), Veneranda is coldly calculating and fully aware of Ythryn's fate. If the characters communicate with her, she greets them warily in Loross (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue" sidebar) and tries to find out what has happened in the world in the centuries since Ythryn's fall. Her singular goal is to restore Ythryn to its past glory. She doesn't know why the city crashed, but she believes that the broken obelisk (see area Y21) can turn back time to repair the damage. To activate its magic, Veneranda says she needs Iriolarthas's *staff of power*, which he keeps in his study. She proposes that the characters break into Iriolarthas's study, steal his staff, and bring it to her. She declines to accompany them, on account of the likely danger. If they complete this mission and return with the staff, she escorts them to the obelisk and tries to activate it. If the characters are unwilling to help Veneranda achieve her goal, they quickly outlive their usefulness, and she tries to destroy them.

***Ritual of Brain Transfer.*** Veneranda can use the equipment in this chamber to transform one humanoid into a brain in a jar. This ritual takes 24 hours and results in the death and liquefaction of the subject's body. Veneranda doesn't allow anyone to view the ritual while it's being performed.

#### Y19f. Staff Storage

>>This irregularly shaped room contains six staffs stored in racks along its walls, with room for more.
>>

Each staff can serve as an arcane focus for a spellcaster. The staffs are as follows:

**Staff 1** is a straight stick of pale ash with a stern-looking owl's head carved into its top.

**Staff 2** is a smooth, polished length of blue-tinted wood that's as strong as steel, with black veins running through it and an octopus carved into its top.

**Staff 3** is made of translucent purple glass, which splits into three branches at the top that circle around one another to form a hollow spiral with an orb of lighter purple glass tucked inside it.

**Staff 4** is carved from golden laspar wood, with carvings of fish swimming upriver along its length.

**Staff 5** is made of weirwood, a hardy substance similar to oak. Its shaft is gnarled and twisted, its top carved to resemble a human hand grasping a snake.

**Staff 6** is made of chardalyn (see "*Chardalyn*") and is suffused with Netherese magic. While holding the staff, a creature is immune to the frightened and poisoned conditions.

#### Y19g. Den

This chamber is affected by the same illusion that conceals the true nature of the ballroom (area Y19b). If that illusion hasn't been dispelled, read:

>>Courtiers lounge on luxurious cushions inside this circular chamber, smoking from long pipes and dining on fruit. Against the back wall is a large harp, its strings being plucked magically to fill the room with haunting music. In the middle of the room, a gem-studded, cubic wooden chest sits on a round marble table with an octopus-shaped base.
>>

If the illusion is dispelled, the music ends and the chamber is revealed to be an abandoned, icy ruin. The chest and the table are real objects that remain after the illusion is dispelled.

***Treasure.*** The chest is an *abracadabrus* (see *appendix D*) that Iriolarthas and his guests used to produce food and drink.

#### Y19h. Members' Bar

These rooms are affected by the same illusion that conceals the true nature of the ballroom (area Y19b). If that illusion hasn't been dispelled, read:

>>Well-dressed revelers mill about, talking loudly to each other while servants carry bottles of wine and spirits around to refill their cups. Behind a rectangular counter, a bald, pale-skinned humanoid serves wine from an ornate bottle.
>>

If the illusion is dispelled, this area is shown to be a frozen ruin bereft of inhabitants.

***Treasure.*** Behind the rectangular counter, held in storage racks, are a dozen bottles of two-thousand-year-old wine. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each bottle, which has preserved its contents. Each bottle of wine is worth 50 gp to an interested buyer.

#### Y19i. Force Bridge

A 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-wide window at the north end of area Y19b overlooks a 35-foot-wide gap in the spire's superstructure. On the far side of this gap, a similar window opens into the Chamber of Sorcery (area Y19j). Between these windows stretches a magical, invisible 5-foot-wide plane of force that serves as a bridge. (On *map 7.3*, this bridge is marked by a pair of dashed lines.) This invisible bridge, which is safe to cross, is suppressed by the activation of the spindle in area Y19n.

#### Y19j. Chamber of Sorcery

>>Your reflections dance over the mirrored surfaces of this chamber. Eleven alcoves extend from the walls like the points of a star, each one narrowing to a niche where a gently glowing crystal is mounted five feet above the floor. The air seems to hum with pent-up power.
>>

Soon after the characters enter this area, an entity called Everlast makes its presence known. Everlast is a living spell bound to the spire. It can manifest in the image of any humanoid species or gender but defaults to the form described below:

>>Suddenly, the crystals brighten as rays of energy burst forth one by one to converge in the center of the room. As more of the rays intersect, a translucent figure comes into view where their light converges: a bald man wearing a long, purple gown. His face breaks into a smile as he sees you.
>>

Everlast speaks the same language as any creature that converses with it. He can't attack or be damaged, and he can't be dispelled.

Iriolarthas created Everlast to aid him and his apprentices in their doomed mission to restore Ythryn from ruin. In the years since its creation, Everlast has seen Iriolarthas crumble into dust and his apprentices transform into nothics. With nothing to do except uphold his standing orders, Everlast has become hopelessly bored. The characters are the first new faces he has seen for centuries, and he immediately warms to them. Everlast's standing orders are as follows:

- Assist in the city's restoration.
- Do not reveal the city's secrets to outsiders.

Everlast can manifest anywhere inside the spire and can move instantaneously between locations within it. If the characters express interest in restoring Ythryn to its former glory, he laments, "Many powerful minds have tried." If the characters mention Veneranda's plan to use Iriolarthas's *staff of power* and the obelisk, Everlast cautions them by saying, "That might be unwise, for the obelisk was damaged in the crash. Iriolarthas was unable to repair it." If the characters ask Everlast how to reach Iriolarthas's study, he says he can't help them, saying, "My orders prevent me from revealing the city's secrets to outsiders."

***Energy Crystals.*** The crystals embedded in the niches are used to project Everlast's illusory form throughout the spire. Each crystal is a Tiny object with AC 8, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If more than half of the crystals are removed or destroyed, Everlast ceases to exist.

***Secret Door.*** This hatch is mounted in the ceiling, 30 feet above the floor, and can be spotted from the floor only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Knocking on the hatch causes it to swing open, revealing a 5-foot-diameter vertical shaft that ascends 50 feet to area Y19k. A character can use an action to pull open the hatch by force, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

![A living blade of disaster is a powerful, annihilating spell given a will of its own.](img/adventure/IDRotF/187-07-005.blade-of-disaster.webp)

#### Y19k. Dome

The following boxed text assumes that the characters arrive by moving up the shaft from area Y19j. Modify this text if the characters enter from the south:

>>You ascend into an oval hall glittering with frost. Carvings decorate the walls, and long icicles hang from the ceiling. A ten-foot-radius dome of translucent ice encloses the area around the shaft from which you emerge. At the far end of the hall, two blade-shaped patches of pitch darkness hover in the air to either side of a double door. A glowing green crystal roughly the size of a human fist is set into the arch above the doorway.
>>

A hemispherical wall of force, its outside coated with a thin layer of ice, covers the shaft leading down to area Y19j. This barrier was created by a *wall of force* spell and is maintained by the glowing green crystal set above the doorway (see "Green Crystal" below). As long as this crystal is glowing, the wall of force can't be dispelled.

Two **living blades of disaster** (see *appendix C*) guard the double door that blocks the way to area Y19l. The blades attack intruders that move in range of their blindsight (30 feet), and the blades can pass right through the wall of force.

***Green Crystal.*** This glowing crystal sustains the wall of force but has become loose in its stone fixture. Whenever a loud noise is made inside the chamber, the loose crystal flickers. Tremendously loud noises, such as those made by a *thunderwave* spell or a *horn of blasting*, cause the crystal to go out for 1d6 rounds, during which time the wall of force is suppressed. The first time this happens, the ice that coats the dome collapses.

A character within reach of the crystal can use an action to pry it from its fixture, which causes the crystal to go dark for good, ending the wall of force. Destroying the crystal has the same effect. The crystal is a Tiny, 1-pound object with AC 13, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### Y19l. Testing Chamber

The following boxed text assumes that the characters look through the doorway from area Y19k. If they arrive from the south, modify the text accordingly:

>>Lining the far wall of this hall are eight doors, each marked with a different arcane symbol. On the wall above them is etched an inscription in Draconic.
>>

A magical trap (marked T on *map 7.3*) fills the 10-foot-square area immediately south of the double door to area Y19k and triggers whenever a creature that is neither a construct nor undead enters the area for the first time. Any creature that triggers the trap is targeted by a *flesh to stone* spell (save DC 17). A creature can't set off the trap more than once. After it's triggered three times, the trap vanishes.

***Draconic Inscription.*** The inscription reads "Speak thy master's name and enter."

***Eight Doors.*** A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes that the symbols on the doors represent the eight schools of magic. Opening any of the eight doors reveals utter darkness beyond. A creature that has darkvision can't see into or through this magical darkness, but a warlock with Devil's Sight can. Magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate it. This darkness fills the tunnels south of the doors and can't be dispelled. To pass through safely, a character must speak the name of one of Iriolarthas's eight apprentices and then step through the door associated with that wizard's school of magic. The eight apprentices were:

|                        |                          |
|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|
|   High Abjurer Taruth  |    High Evoker Zadulus   |
| High Conjurer Damorith |  High Illusionist Ajamar |
|   High Diviner Apius   | High Necromancer Cadavix |
|  High Enchanter Ivira  | High Transmuter Metaltra |

 The characters can learn the apprentices' names from the museum (area Y29). Each time a creature steps through a door without speaking the correct name, a **barbed devil** appears in the dark corridor beyond. The devil can see in the magical darkness and attacks any creatures that move into the corridor without first speaking the correct name. These devils can leave the darkness to pursue their foes. One minute after a devil appears, it disappears, leaving no trace of itself behind. Once a barbed devil has been summoned, no other devil can be summoned into that same corridor for 24 hours.

#### Y19m. Chamber of the Ebon Star

>>A vortex of glowing stars hangs in the air inside this chamber, slowly rotating on its axis. As the constellations move, they cast radiant starlight across the walls. Eight high-backed chairs, each bearing a different arcane symbol, face this starry miasma.
>>

Iriolarthas's apprentices, known as the Wizards of the Ebon Star, governed Ythryn from this hall. Eight magically darkened corridors connect this hall to area Y19l. Separate archways open into areas Y19n and Y19o.

At the south end of the hall, a 10-foot-wide passageway leads to a locked double door, beyond which lies a balcony (area Y19p). The door is warded with magic that prevents it from being damaged or forced open; it can be unlocked, however, by someone who uses the adamantine key in area Y19o, or by a character who uses thieves' tools and makes a successful DC 18 Dexterity check as an action to pick the lock.

***Star Field.*** The swirling star field represents the cosmos as it was known to the Netherese. A character who studies the star field sees a strange phenomenon: a dark star in a position where no known star exists today. This character now risks being cursed with a foreboding sense of doom. At the end of the character's next long rest, the character must make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains the following flaw: "I can't look at the sky because the ebon star might be looking back at me." Any magic that ends a curse can rid the character of this flaw.

***Wizards' Chairs.*** Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes that the symbols on the chairs represent the eight schools of magic.

Anyone who has a supernatural charm gained by drinking from the goblet in area Y8 can sit safely in the chair for the school of magic tied to that charm. Similarly, a wizard can sit in whichever chair matches their chosen arcane tradition. (For example, if **Vellynne Harpell** is with the party, she can sit in the chair marked with the symbol of necromancy, since she is a necromancer.) If one or more party members take their proper seats here, the star field transforms into a glowing door that persists for 1 minute before transforming back into its original form. While in this room, Iriolarthas the demilich can use an action to cause the doorway to open without having to sit in a chair. Creatures that move through this door are teleported to the upper level of area Y19q.

Each chair is a Medium object with AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. Destroying all the chairs causes the star field to disappear, cutting off access to area Y19q from this room.

#### Y19n. Stasis Chamber

>>A ten-foot-tall spindle of gray stone hovers upright and rotates slowly inside this circular chamber. All around it, the surfaces of the room's walls are cracked, as though some terrible energy once coursed through them.
>>

This chamber was built to house unstable magic items during experimentation, but it couldn't contain the artifact that Iriolarthas and his apprentices retrieved from the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice. During a routine examination, the spindle briefly became active, dispelled magical effects throughout Ythryn, and caused the city to plunge into the Reghed Glacier. The spindle is now dormant but can be reactivated to wreak havoc on the Weave.

The spindle is immune to all damage and is unaffected by any magic in existence today. It can't be moved from this location. If it is targeted by a spell of 5th level or higher, an explosion of magical energy blasts from it: all magic items and magical effects within a three-mile radius (including those within the spire) are suppressed for 24 hours, and spellcasters are drained of any unexpended spell slots. Living spells, constructs, and other magically created creatures are unaffected. The pulse of energy suppresses magical traps throughout the city and causes the floating chamber above Skydock Spire (area Y28) to crash into to the ground, pulverizing it and dealing 99 (18d10) bludgeoning damage to each creature inside it.

![This stone spindle, a relic of the ancient world, brought down Ythryn nearly two thousand years ago](img/adventure/IDRotF/188-07-006.stone-spindle.webp)

#### Y19o. Library

>>The walls of this roughly triangular room are filled with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Hundreds of books and scrolls were thrown free of their resting places when the city crashed and now cover the floor. Time and bitter cold have not been kind to them.
>>

Most of the books and scrolls that litter the floor have been ruined by centuries of disuse, but adventurers who search the remains unearth two survivors: a scroll (see "Treasure" below) and a brittle tome with a black, eight-pointed star on its front cover. This brittle tome records the various meetings of the Wizards of the Ebon Star. One passage explains, in the Draconic script, that "Master Iriolarthas opens the door to his study when three or more of his apprenticesÃ¢ÂÂor those empowered by the goblet in the House of the ArcaneÃ¢ÂÂare seated correctly in the Chamber of the Ebon Star." This passage provides adventurers with the information they need to open the magical doorway in area Y19m.

***Treasure.*** Lying among the ruined documents are two useful items: a *scroll of the comet* (see *appendix D*) and an adamantine key. The key is nonmagical and unlocks the double door to the balcony (area Y19p).

![Iriolarthas the demilich](img/adventure/IDRotF/189-07-007.demilich.webp)

#### Y19p. High Court Balcony

A locked double door bars the way to area Y19m. The door is warded with magic that prevents it from being damaged or forced open; it can be unlocked, however, by someone who uses the adamantine key in area Y19o, or by a character who uses thieves' tools and makes a successful DC 18 Dexterity check as an action.

The Wizards of the Ebon Star used this balcony to make proclamations to the inhabitants of Ythryn. Words spoken by a creature standing on the balcony are magically amplified to sound ten times louder than normal.

#### Y19q. Iriolarthas's Study

This room can be accessed by activating the magic door in area Y19m. The door is a two-way portal that snaps shut after 1 minute, though it can be reopened from this side by speaking the proper command word ("Saldrinar"). Anyone who arrives by this route appears on the room's upper level, which the following boxed text assumes:

>>This large chamber has lain undisturbed for centuries. On the upper level, all around you, are tables covered with wizardly paraphernalia. A soft groaning sound emanates from a shadowy, door-sized rectangle along the curved northern wall.
>>
>>Staircases to the east and west descend to the lower part of the room, where a sunken library is situated in a twenty-foot-wide, ten-foot-deep circular pit. A ladder running along a circular track inside this hole allows easy access to the many books and scrolls on its shelves.
>>

If the characters have not yet encountered Iriolarthas, the **demilich** and three **nothics** are present:

>>Perched on the edge of the pit are three aberrant creatures, each one staring at you with a singular, hideous eye. Floating above the middle of the pit is a human skull with wispy, arcane symbols forming above it.
>>

Have the players roll initiative for their characters, and roll initiative for all the other creatures present.

See the "Iriolarthas the Demilich" section at the start of the chapter for information about the demilich. Iriolarthas attacks anyone who takes its *staff of power* or spellbook from atop the tables (see "Treasure" below). The nothics defend the demilich and themselves.

The shadowy, groaning rectangle on the north wall is a **living demiplane** (see *appendix C*) that was created when Iriolarthas escaped Ythryn's fall. It moves toward the nearest intruder with the intent of trapping that creature into its extradimensional chamber. Anyone who is cast into this chamber must deal with five hostile creatures already trapped inside it: three **galvan magen** (see appendix C) and two **flesh golems**. As the golems attack new arrivals, the magen use their Shocking Touch and Static Discharge actions to heal the golems' wounds.

The sunken library in the middle of the study has shelves lining its 10-foot-high walls and a ladder that can be pushed along a circular track to reach every shelf. Among the books and scrolls kept here is a bundle of parchment maps and schematics detailing aspects of Ythryn. Characters who study these papers for at least 1 hour learn the following facts:

- The city was held aloft by the *Ythryn mythallar* (area Y23). Up to eight mages could attune to this device at one time. If all of them agreed, they could use its power to move the city through the skies or control the weather for miles around it.
- If disaster ever struck the city, the wizards could exploit the power of the obelisk (area Y21) to turn back time and avert ruin. The schematics contain instructions for activating the obelisk, which requires a *staff of power* as a power source.
- The command word to reopen the magic door to area Y19m is "Saldrinar," which also happens to be the name of a long-dead Netherese archmage.
- The command word to deactivate the force field around the spire is "Olostin." If this name is spoken aloud within Iriolarthas's study, the force field surrounding the spire and the *Ythryn mythallar* (area Y23) deactivates permanently.

***Treasure.*** The following treasures can be found amid the rubbish on the upper level of the study: a small metal case containing four vials of quicksilver (500 gp each), an intricate crystal rod (1,800 gp), Iriolarthas's fully charged *staff of power*, a hefty spellbook titled *The Incantations of Iriolarthas*, and a *scroll of tarrasque summoning* (see *appendix D* for descriptions of the spellbook and the scroll). The crystal rod and vials of quicksilver are nonmagical material components needed for the *create magen* spell in Iriolarthas's spellbook.

*Professor Skant* is excited by the discovery of the *scroll of tarrasque summoning*, since the **tarrasque** is one of its areas of expertise. The *professor orb* knows all the tarrasque lore in the *Monster Manual*, as well as the monster's traits, which it's happy to share with the party.

### Necropolis Locations (Y20-Y29)

#### Y20. Tower of Evocation

>>The top of this tower is shaped like an axe blade. Red light shines out from a slender window high overhead.
>>

The tower's interior is damaged by fire, lightning, and acid, having borne the brunt of centuries of destructive spellcasting. A spiral staircase ascends to the topmost chamber. When the characters arrive here, read:

>>Red orbs of light dance like fireflies around this thirty-foot-diameter octagonal chamber. A large unlit brazier stands in the center of the room, and eight ten-foot-square alcoves line the walls, each filled with ice. The arched ceiling is covered with icicles.
>>

This chamber is lit by a permanent *dancing lights* spell that can be dispelled (DC 17). Characters who succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spot an inscription on the ceiling, but the ice covering it renders it unreadable (see "Inscription" below).

The central brazier is enchanted. A single spark created inside it causes it to blaze with magic flames for 24 hours. If the brazier is lit, the heat it gives off starts to melt the ice in the chamber, revealing the words of the inscription after 10 minutes.

***Alcoves.*** Examination of the alcoves reveals that each one contains what appears to be a 10-foot cube of ice. One of the cubes has a humanoid skeletonÃ¢ÂÂthe remains of High Evoker ZadulusÃ¢ÂÂsuspended inside it. These blocks of ice are, in fact, eight **gelatinous cubes** held in magical cryostasis. If the brazier is used to thaw the ice in the room, these cubes awaken after 10 minutes and emerge from their alcoves, attacking all other creatures in the room.

***Inscription.*** The inscription on the ceiling is written in Draconic and reads "Fifth, quench the flame in thy palm with ice." This is a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad").

#### Y21. Obelisk

>>A sixty-foot-tall obelisk of black stone, its surface covered in arcane runes, projects from the ground. A thin crack has formed on one side, stretching from the obelisk's base to its middle.
>>

Before Ythryn crashed, Iriolarthas relied on this obelisk as a precautionary measure in case Ythryn experienced a catastrophe. It was one of a few rare Netherese artifacts that could rewind time (see the "Secret of the Obelisks" sidebar). It was damaged during Ythryn's fall and, despite Iriolarthas's best efforts, the demilich could not repair it. Characters who learn about the obelisk in Iriolarthas's study (area Y19q) know how to activate it (see "Activating the Obelisk" below).

A character who examines the obelisk and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes that the magic runes inscribed on the obelisk represent all eight schools of magic. If the check result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, the character also identifies runes relating to chronomancy, the art of magically manipulating time.

***Activating the Obelisk.*** If the characters retrieved Iriolarthas's *staff of power* and Veneranda is with them, she insists that the staff be used to activate the dormant obelisk. Any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check can verify that this task is not beyond the staff's power, although it would take at least half of the staff's charges to accomplish. If a creature attuned to the staff uses an action to expend 10 or more of its charges while touching the staff to the obelisk, power surges from the staff and triggers the following devastating events:

- The staff splits in half, triggering its Retributive Strike property (see the staff's description in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).
- Any creature within 120 feet of the obelisk that isn't killed by the staff's explosion becomes 10 years younger. Creatures whose age is reduced to 0 by this effect wink out of existence, leaving behind the items they were wearing or carrying.
- The obelisk disintegrates, as do other obelisks like it throughout the world, but not before hurling the entire planet into the past, to a time prior to the fall of Ythryn (see "Year of Chilled Marrow").

> ##### Secret of the Obelisks
>
>In this adventure, we learn the secret of the obelisks that have appeared in other fifth edition adventures published by Wizards of the Coast, including *Tomb of Annihilation* and *Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage*.
>
>The first group of these magical obelisks was crafted by a secret society of spellcasters called the Weavers. These obelisks could alter reality on a grand scale, sending a region or an entire world back to an earlier time (effectively erasing part of history). The obelisks were constructed to counteract the effects of calamitous spells and cataclysmic events.
>
>An evil wizard named Vecna stole one such obelisk and used it to erase the obelisk's creators from existence. Vecna also stole the knowledge needed to create new ones. That knowledge later came into the possession of Netherese wizards, who built similar obelisks of their own. They believed that if some catastrophe destroyed their empire, these obelisks could help restore it. Unfortunately for them, most of the obelisks built to protect Netheril were stolen or otherwise lost over time, as were records of their purpose and information about how to activate them.
>

#### Y22. Tower of Illusion

>>An obsidian tower shrouded in gossamer mist soars before you. Eyes carved into the stonework appear to fixate on you as you approach the entrance. The spire's highest window emits a purple light.
>>

A *detect magic* spell cast here reveals an aura of illusion magic. This magic makes the eyes carved into the tower appear to follow those who approach the structure. Characters who enter the tower find the mist inside as well. Haunting sounds fill the air: heartbeats, sobbing, and ragged, gasping breaths.

As the party advances, the mists around the characters manifest into illusions of their worst fears, and each character becomes the target of a *phantasmal killer* spell cast at 8th level (save DC 17). Characters who survive the experience emerge together in the tower's upper chamber, which is free of mist.

***Chamber of Illusion.*** The tower's uppermost chamber is 30 feet square and lit by purple *continual flame* spells in wall sconces. An inscription written on the walls in Draconic reads "Sixth, show thy face to the sky." This is illusory script masquerading as a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad"). If the characters leave after acquiring only this information, they hear the faint laughter of Ythryn's High Illusionist, Ajamar, trailing behind them as they exit the tower. The real passage is revealed when the illusory script is successfully dispelled (DC 17) or examined by someone who has truesight. It reads "Sixth, hide thyself behind a mask."

#### Y23. Ythryn Mythallar

This enormous artifact is enclosed within the force field surrounding the Spire of Iriolarthas. To reach it, a character must first perform the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad") to lower the force field.

>>Beneath the great spire, a luminous fifty-foot-diameter crystal sphere rests on an ornate stand.
>>

See *appendix D* for a description of the *Ythryn mythallar* and its magical properties. The first time a creature tries to attune to the *mythallar*, its meditation is disturbed by the arrival of a **tomb tapper** (see *appendix C*), which tunnels up from belowground to attack anyone present. The tomb tapper fights to the death to defend the *Ythryn mythallar*.

Unless Iriolarthas is destroyed, the demilich is already attuned to the *mythallar*. If Iriolarthas senses that another creature is trying to use the *mythallar*, it always disallows the attempt and flies to the *mythallar*'s location to discourage any further tampering with the device. Only by destroying the **demilich** can the characters use the *mythallar*'s properties unimpeded. The *mythallar*'s power to control the weather can undo the everlasting winter that Auril has cast over Icewind Dale (see "*Epilogue*").

#### Y24. Tower of Enchantment

>>Ice has engulfed the lower floors of this crumbling tower. Pink light pours out of the highest windowÃ¢ÂÂa single point of illumination in a dark and out-of-the-way region of the city.
>>

A *detect magic* spell cast here reveals an aura of enchantment magic. The interior walls are covered with the following sentence in Draconic crudely written with pitch over and over: "All work and no play make Ivira a dull girl." The floor is strewn with pitch-covered buckets and mops frozen stiff by the cold.

As the party explores higher up in the tower, the recurring phrase changes to: "I am Ivira. Ivira is my name." These words are written in wine stains, and the floor is littered with empty wine bottles.

Painted in blood above the door leading to the uppermost chamber are the words "The crown knows all!" in Draconic. When the characters enter the topmost chamber, read:

>>An elderly woman sits rigidly on a black throne, shrouded in ice. She wears a crown of entwined iron tentacles, and her forehead is bruised where the band fits tightly against her skull. An inscription decorates the wall behind her.
>>

This chamber is lit by pink *continual flame* spells flickering in sconces.

At the height of her power, the archmage Ivira wore a magic crown to shield her mind against mental attacks. When Ythryn crashed and magic was momentarily undone, Ivira's crown became corrupted and began to siphon away her memories. She has endured centuries as a husk of her former self, kept alive by the magic of her crown. In her current state, she is stunned.

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check can tell that Ivira is still alive. Her crown is cursed (see below). Removing it from her head causes Ivira to shudder and shed the ice that has formed around her. With the crown gone, her body rapidly deteriorates, as the centuries take their toll. Ivira has only a few seconds before she dies and turns to dust; with her dying breath, she implores the characters in Loross (the dead Netherese tongue) to "destroy the crown... release my memories... let me have peace."

***Cursed Crown.*** Ivira can't remove the crown from her head. Any other creature that touches it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by it and use its next action to don the crown. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is immune to this effect of the crown for the next 24 hours.

From the moment it is donned, the crown begins to siphon memories from its wearer, starting with its earliest memories. The wearer can sense that its memories are being stolen but can't remove the crown from its head except within an antimagic field.

After wearing the crown for 1 hour, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the crown is removed from its head by someone else. This saving throw is repeated at the end of each hour until either the crown has been removed or its wearer has become stunned. If a creature wears the crown for ten uninterrupted days, the condition becomes permanent, as the crown reduces its wearer to a mindless husk. A *greater restoration* spell or similar magic ends the effect and restores the creature's lost memories.

The crown can be destroyed on the *anvil of disjunction* (area Y4). It is otherwise impervious to damage. If the crown is destroyed, the memories it has absorbed flood over all creatures within 10 feet of it. Characters assailed by this barrage gain 1d6 pieces of lore from the Ythryn Lore table.

***Inscription.*** The inscription on the wall behind the throne is written in Draconic and reads "Fourth, coax a secret from another." This is a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad").

#### Y25. Hall of Weightless Wonder

>>Four basalt columns support a huge mirrored dome on which are reflected Ythryn's tallest spires and the cavern's vast stalactites.
>>

Ythryn's elite used this hall for meditation. As someone floated around inside the dome, an illusory image of the person went on with their daily affairs elsewhere in the city.

The four supporting columns have doors in their bases, which open into shafts that ascend to the dome. The shafts are 60 feet long and lit from above by the shifting auroral light of the dome's interior. A character who steps inside a column levitates up to the dome in 1 round. When a character reaches the dome, read:

>>The interior of the dome is illuminated by a swirling miasma of colors. Frozen human figures float in the air, cross-legged and serene.
>>

Creatures in the dome gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. The corpses of a dozen Netherese apprentices hover around this area, with their hands on their knees and their eyes closed. Characters who adopt this position can meditate by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom check. While meditating, a character can cast the *project image* spell (save DC 15). The spell lasts for 1 hour, and a character can perform the meditation once per day. To leave the dome, a character must stand at the top of one of the four shafts, to be transported down in a manner similar to how they arrived.

#### Y26. Tower of Transmutation

>>A tower rises before you, straight as an arrow. A faint light shines from in the spire's highest window, and hairline cracks creep up its walls like ivy.
>>

The cracks covering the outside of the tower were caused during the crash, when the magic protecting the tower strained to keep it from collapsing.

Describe the interior of the tower as follows:

>>The tower's interior walls are sculpted with impressions of humanoid forms pressing out from withinÃ¢ÂÂclawing hands and howling faces, captured in stone forever.
>>

As Ythryn was about to fall out of the sky, High Transmuter Metaltra used a *true polymorph* spell to transform herself into something she thought would survive the city's destruction: an adamantine statue. An hour later, when the spell should have ended, nothing happened. Through no fault of her own, she had become a statue permanently. Only a *wish* spell can restore her, and then only briefly as she ages centuries in a matter of seconds.

Characters who climb to the tower's peak find the statue of Metaltra lying in a corner. The statue depicts a woman in a wizard's robe, posed as if she is completing a spell. As her statue was being thrown about during the crash, it damaged part of an inscription on one wall.

***Inscription.*** The damaged inscription is a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "Rite of the Arcane Octad"). Written in Draconic, it reads "Eighth, stand firm in thy circle of death and consumeÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ." The missing word, destroyed by Metaltra's statue, is "poison." Characters who search the room for stone fragments can't find the pieces they need to identify the missing word, but casting a *mending* cantrip on the wall repairs the damage and reconstructs the missing word. If the characters don't have access to the *mending* cantrip, a *divination* spell or similar magic can be used to learn the missing word.

***Treasure.*** Adventurers who search the uppermost chamber find a *bag of beans* in a small pile of rubbish.

#### Y27. Music Hall

>>This enormous, boot-shaped structure is capped with three pipes that resemble the arteries of a titanic heart. Tall doors open into the structure's dark interior.
>>

Old posters are plastered to the outer walls of this music hall. Anyone who can read the Draconic script can translate the poster closest to the entrance: "Experience the Netherese Esoteric Orchestra's masterwork, *The Dark Between the Stars*!" A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check knows this legendary piece of music, as does any bard in the party. If the characters enter the music hall, read:

>>This grand music hall is aglitter with ice, and the floor underfoot is strewn with the crystal shards of fallen chandeliers. The frozen corpses of the audience lie strewn among the tiered seats, their expressions frozen in rapturous adulation. On the stage, cadaverous musicians slump over their shattered instruments.
>>

The Netherese Esoteric Orchestra was midway through its crowning performance when Ythryn fell from the sky. Determined to finish, the musicians played on as the city hurtled to the ground, but Ythryn crashed before they could finish. Deprived of the opportunity to complete their grand finale, the orchestra's troubled spirits haunt the hall.

A conductor's baton rests on a lectern at the front of the stage. If a character grasps the baton, the hall echoes with the sounds of instruments being tuned, and a spectral orchestra materializes from out of the corpses onstage. The ghostly musicians hold their instruments and stare expectantly at their conductor. These spirits can't be turned or harmed in any way.

***Conducting the Orchestra.*** To conduct the orchestra through the end of their final symphony, a character must succeed on three consecutive DC 15 Charisma (Performance) checks made 1 minute apart. A character who knows The Dark Between the Stars gains advantage on each check.

On the first successful check, the orchestra launches into a hauntingly beautiful performance. If the next check succeeds, listeners experience a falling sensation in the pits of their stomachs, mirroring Ythryn's downward plunge, as the music reaches a crescendo. If the third and final check succeeds, the conductor brings the piece to a satisfying close as the sound of ghostly applause rises from the audience and phantasmal black roses rain down on the musicians, who face the audience and bow before fading into the afterlife. A character who successfully conducts the orchestra gains inspiration.

On each failed check, the spirits become angry, and their antipathy toward the conductor deals 27 (5d10) psychic damage to each creature in the music hall.

#### Y28. Skydock Spire

>>A tower more than one hundred feet tall has a rotating glass chamber hovering above its ruined summit. Four pointed pillars clutch the chamber's walls, giving it the appearance of a colossal floating crown.
>>

Skydock Spire stands 120 feet tall, and the glass chamber magically floats 30 feet above it. The chamber slowly rotates clockwise. The tower and the chamber are all that remain of a much larger facility that served principally as a dock for flying ships.

Characters who enter the tower see a staircase coiling around its interior walls. From atop the ruined roof, a character using rope can make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to catch onto the rotating chamber, which is a 40-foot-diameter room made of glass that offers a panoramic view of the city. This chamber once served as an opulent and intimate meeting place for the upper echelons of Ythryn's society. Now it lies in ruin, with entrances lying open and the furnishings inside smashed.

***Treasure.*** Characters who sift through the debris on the floor of the chamber find a miniature Netherese skycoach in a bottle (750 gp) and a nonmagical wand (a possible spellcasting focus) made of chardalyn (see "*Chardalyn*"). It is suffused with evil magic. While grasping the wand, one feels an urge to inflict terrible harm upon others, but the urge is easily resisted. Prolonged custody of the wand might have a more detrimental effect, at your discretion.

#### Y29. Museum

>>A palatial hexagonal building rises before you, crowned with a glittering domed roof. A double door on one side stands slightly ajar.
>>

Characters who venture inside the museum find that statues and other objects of art have fallen from their plinths and lie in broken shards across the floor, and centuries of exposure have ruined most of the paintings that hang on the walls in elaborate frames.

***Lower Level.*** Six **nothics** are searching the lower level of the museum for relics. When they detect the entry of intruders, they converge on them and attack out of hunger.

***Upper Level.*** Characters who ascend the stairs to the upper level come across the following display:

>>Suspended from the ceiling of a spacious fifty-foot square antechamber is the glittering, frost-covered corpse of a thirty-foot-long aberration shaped like a funnel, resembling an anemone. A tooth-filled maw at the wider end is surrounded by rubbery cilia, and around it dangle four limp, spindly appendages, each one ending in a clawed hand. At the opposite end of the body is a tail with a stinger.
>>
>>A frost-covered plaque is bolted to a pedestal nearby, and the entire display is framed by four stone pillars that are, oddly, frost-free.
>>

![A spitting mimic's size allows it to assume such large forms as walls and pillars.](img/adventure/IDRotF/190-07-008.mimic.webp)

The pillars are four **spitting mimics** (see *appendix C*) that guard the creature on display, attacking anyone who touches or otherwise disturbs it.

The dead creature is a magically preserved phaerimm suspended from the ceiling by a dozen strong wires. If the characters wipe away the frost on the plaque, they can read what it says about the phaerimm in Draconic:

>> ##### Adult PhaerimmÃ¢ÂÂdo Not Touch!
>>
>>Dwellers of the Underdark, phaerimm are malevolent aberrations that are master spellcasters and highly resistant to magic. They use their telepathy to control the weak-minded. They strive to erase all other beings from existence and are known to have caused the collapse of the sarrukh empire of Isstosseffifil. They use their tail stingers to inject their eggs into alien hosts.
>>

***Iriolarthas and His Apprentices.*** Characters who proceed farther into the upper floor can see the museum's domed ceiling, which is still intact and a sight to behold. It depicts a powerful mage standing on a balcony of the enclave's central spire, addressing a sea of Netherese citizens below, who stare up at the figure, cheering. This is an image of Iriolarthas at the height of his power, magically preserved in stained glass that glows with its own arcane light. Eight large portraits adorn the walls beneath the dome, depicting Iriolarthas's eight apprentices, known as the Wizards of the Ebon Star. The portraits hang 20 feet above the ground, and a frost-covered plaque is fixed to the wall just beneath each one. The faces in the portraits are depicted as looking up toward their master, Iriolarthas, with expressions of respect. Characters who clear the ice from the plaques can learn their names: High Abjurer Taruth, High Conjurer Damorith, High Diviner Apius, High Necromancer Cadavix, High Evoker Zadulus, High Illusionist Ajamar, High Enchanter Ivira, and High Transmuter Metaltra.

## Dealing with the Arcane Brotherhood

In this chapter, two wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood attempt to realize their grand ambitions: **Vellynne Harpell** and **Avarice**. Both are described in appendix C.

If the characters are having trouble solving a puzzle in Ythryn, such as how to deactivate the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, you can use Vellynne or **Avarice** to help them. Both NPCs are highly intelligent and can help the characters arrive at a solution. You, as the DM, can use them to keep the adventure from grinding to a halt.

Both Vellynne and **Avarice** will do almost anything to obtain Iriolarthas's spellbook, and they are only slightly less determined when it comes time to choose who gets Iriolarthas's *staff of power*, the *scroll of the comet*, and the *scroll of tarrasque summoning*.

If the characters helped **Dzaan's simulacrum** become a real person in chapter 2 (see "Lost Spire of Netheril"), he might be present as well. Without a full complement of spells, Dzaan isn't nearly as helpful as Vellynne nor as dangerous as **Avarice**, but he's just as greedy and self-serving. Roleplay him accordingly.

### Vellynne's Help

**Vellynne Harpell** can use her *comprehend languages* spell to translate passages of Draconic script found throughout the necropolis, and her *Leomund's tiny hut* spell conjures an excellent refuge against the extreme cold. She tries to be as useful as possible while staking claim to her fair share of whatever treasure is found in Ythryn. She is particularly interested in magic items, especially those of a wizardly bent (such as Iriolarthas's *staff of power*).

#### Vellynne's Fall

If the characters part ways with Vellynne for any reason, she tries to explore Ythryn alone and contracts the arcane blight. The next time the characters see her, she is either partially or fully transformed into a nothic.

### Avarice's Arrival

**Avarice** (see appendix C) follows the characters through the Caves of Hunger to Ythryn, killing any NPCs they left behind to guard the caves. The albino tiefling wizard is joined by her two **gargoyles**, her **raven** familiar, twenty **cult fanatics** (members of the Knights of the Black Sword), and ten roped **mountain goats** (see *appendix C*) that the cultists use for food and to set off traps. If Huarwar Mulphoon and Fel Suparra are alive, they are among the cult fanatics (see area C6 for more information about these NPCs).

The Knights of the Black Sword speak Common and Infernal, and they have the following additional trait:

***Icy Doom.*** When the cultist dies, its corpse freezes for 9 days, during which time it can't be thawed, harmed by fire, animated, or raised from the dead.

**Avarice** and her retinue enter the necropolis 12 hours after the party arrives. **Avarice** immediately claims the floating chamber above Skydock Spire (area Y28) as her base of operations, using her *fly* spell to reach it, while the cult fanatics encamp around the base of the tower. **Avarice**'s goal is simple: conquer Ythryn and claim its treasures for herself.

From her refuge, **Avarice** divides her expedition into four hunting parties of five cult fanatics each, and sends them off to explore the ruins, using her raven familiar and the gargoyles as aerial scouts. The party can meet **Avarice**'s minions anywhere in the necropolis (including inside the spire if the force field surrounding it is deactivated or suppressed). They have orders to attack the characters on sight.

Each time the party explores a new building, there is a 20 percent chance that one of **Avarice**'s hunting parties is already inside or arrives while the party is searching its interior.

#### Old Rivalries Die Hard

If she becomes aware of Vellynne's presence in Ythryn, **Avarice** uses her raven familiar to deliver a written invitation to her rival, asking Vellynne to join her inside her floating lair. Vellynne accepts the invitation unless the characters strongly discourage her from doing so. There, **Avarice** coldly lays down her terms: abandon the necropolis within the hour. Conflict between members of the Arcane Brotherhood is forbidden, but **Avarice** makes it clear she is willing to ignore the rules if nobody lives to find out. When Vellynne leaves the meeting, **Avarice** sends her familiar out to spy on her rival and see if her demands are met, which Vellynne has no intention of doing.

#### Avarice as an Ally

**Avarice** is smart enough to ally with the characters if doing so might help her conquer Ythryn, but she won't join forces as long as **Vellynne Harpell** is with themÃ¢ÂÂshe demands that they cast out her hated rival. If the characters oblige and banish Vellynne from their ranks, **Avarice** reciprocates by sharing 1d4 pieces of Ythryn lore she has learned (determine each piece by rolling on the Ythryn Lore table).

Unlike Vellynne, who accompanies the characters, **Avarice** prefers to remain in her glass chamber atop Skydock Spire and stay in touch with the characters remotely by using her *Rary's telepathic bond* spell. Once the characters find all the inscriptions they need to bypass the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, **Avarice** emerges from her base and accompanies them into the tower, eager to claim the treasures inside.

## Auril's Wrath

The Frostmaiden likes to preserve beauty by freezing it. If the characters failed to defeat Auril in *chapter 5*, she takes umbrage with anyone who unseals and plunders the necropolis of Ythryn. After the party has spent one day inside the city, Auril pays Ythryn a visit.

Please review the information about the Frostmaiden in  *appendix C* before running encounters with her.

### The Frostmaiden's Forces

When the Frostmaiden arrives in Ythryn, the temperature throughout the necropolis drops by several degrees. Auril is joined by three **frost giant skeletons** (see *appendix C*), six **snow golems** (see *appendix C*), and a pack of six **winter wolves**. After sending her skeletons, golems, and wolves into the city in small groups to kill interlopers on sight, Auril shuts down the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas by sheer force of her divine will and watches over the city from its high balcony (area Y19p). The force field remains deactivated until the last of Auril's forms is destroyed or until she leaves the spire.

Any of **Avarice**'s minions still patrolling the city are swiftly captured and dragged before the Frostmaiden. Auril murders each captive in turn and transforms the cultist into a **coldlight walker** (see *appendix C*). These undead horrors venture out into the necropolis to hunt down the living.

### Final Showdown

If the characters defeat most of Auril's minions, the god's cool voice echoes across the city from the high balcony of the Spire of Iriolarthas, demanding that they leave Ythryn or face her wrath. One hour after making this announcement, Auril leaves the tower and prowls through the streets in search of the characters. For every hour that passes, there is a 20 percent chance that she catches up with them. Only characters who flee the city and return to Icewind Dale are spared her wrath.

## Summoning the Tarrasque

Characters who find the *scroll of tarrasque summoning* in the Spire of Iriolarthas might be sorely tempted to use it. *Professor Skant*, an expert on the tarrasque, warns the characters about the uncontrollable nature of the monster and the danger it represents, but the *professor orb* also confesses that it would love to observe the tarrasque firsthand.

If summoned in Ythryn, the **tarrasque** destroys everything in sight before smashing its way through the Caves of Hunger and continuing its rampage across Icewind Dale, inevitably putting Ten-Towns in peril. The mountains to the south, the sea to the north and west, and the towering glacier to the east contain the tarrasque for a while. The extreme cold also makes the creature lethargic. It might take months, but the hungry tarrasque eventually makes its way southward through the mountain pass, imperiling the rest of the Sword Coast, if nothing is done to curtail its rampage.

If summoned on Auril's island, the tarrasque is trapped there by the deep, churning Sea of Moving Ice. The behemoth lays waste to Grimskalle and everything else on the island before sinking into a deep hibernation. Auril, if she survives, is forced to abandon her island lair and find a new refuge.

# Epilogue

Depending on the characters' actions and the whims of the dice gods, this adventure has several possible endings. Likely conclusions are discussed below, though others are certainly possible.

## What Secrets Remain

Allow time at the end of the adventure for players to reveal any character secrets that have not come to light. Some players will want to keep their characters' secrets buried. For the others, work with them to figure out the best way for the characters' secrets to bear fruit. For example, a character who has the Ring Hunter secret might still be searching for the signet ring that secures their inheritance; perhaps the ring is discovered during a celebratory dinner in Ten-Towns, when the character cuts open their pan-fried knucklehead trout and the ring unceremoniously spills out!

## Summer Is Coming

Slaying Auril or her roc prevents the Frostmaiden from casting her nightly spell, ending her everlasting winter. The characters can also counteract the Frostmaiden's everlasting winter by using the *Ythryn mythallar* to effect a change in the weather, though any such attempt inevitably leads to a confrontation with Auril and her faithful. Only by slaying Auril can the characters deprive her followers of their god-granted spells and their will to fight.

With the Frostmaiden's defeat, normal seasonal weather returns to Icewind Dale. The sun again rises above the horizon, and as temperatures improve, flora and fauna begin to recover. Depending on how they fared against the chardalyn dragon in *chapter 4*, the people of Ten-Towns can look forward to warmer times once more.

Auril's death is temporary, for a god who has mortal worshipers can't truly die. When the Frostmaiden is resurrected on the next winter solstice, she has all her divine power. But her inclination is to retreat from the world and not allow herself to be imperiled by mortals once more. The characters won't have to deal with her again in their lifetimes unless they continue meddling in her followers' affairs.

The characters can help Ten-Towners rebuild their settlements in the wake of the chardalyn dragon's rampage and the floods. If the dragon has not yet been defeated, finding and destroying it should be a priority. Until its master sends it on another rampage, it lurks inside the forge where it was created (see *chapter 3*).

Characters who help rebuild Ten-Towns might be asked to take up the mantle of speaker in one or more communities, replacing leaders who were killed during the adventure. If he survived, Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos opposes the characters' political ascendance, since they represent a threat to Zhentarim control of the region; without a power base of his own, however, Naerth can do little to stop them.

![The end of winter signals a resurgence of life in Icewind Dale](img/adventure/IDRotF/191-08-001.end-of-winter.webp)

## Winter Everlasting

If the characters don't stop Auril, her everlasting winter becomes unendurable to most of Icewind Dale's inhabitants. The hostile climate and the scarcity of food force indigenous creatures to migrate southward or die. As go the **reindeer**, so go the Reghed tribesfolk. In time, even the lakes freeze solid, depriving Ten-Towners of the knucklehead trout upon which their survival depends. Within a year or two, Icewind Dale becomes a gods-forsaken wasteland as cold as Stygia. The bitter cold allows Levistus to open portals between Icewind Dale and the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from which come forth ice devils under the archdevil's command. Knights of the Black Sword who survive to see these events come to pass try to maintain a foothold in the region, though they are opposed by duergar at every turn.

The ice devils help clear the way for the duergar, who aren't going anywhere unless the characters kill **Xardorok Sunblight** and put an end to his line. Once Ten-Towns is no longer a threat to his supremacy, Xardorok does his utmost to conquer the rest of Icewind Dale. If left unchecked, the duergar become a controlling power in the region. The ice devils, once subservient to Levistus, are dragooned by Asmodeus into helping the duergar turn the Far North into a vassal kingdom secretly under the sway of the Nine Hells.

## Year of Chilled Marrow

If the characters use Iriolarthas's *staff of power* to activate the obelisk in Ythryn, they inadvertently reset the world to a time predating the fall of Ythryn and the end of Netheril. The obelisk has sent them back to the spring of Ã¢ÂÂ343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow, six months prior to the catastrophe that causes Ythryn's fall and another four years before Netheril's demise. The characters find themselves high in the sky over Icewind Dale. Use the following boxed text to set the scene:

>>The obelisk is gone, leaving an indentation in the ground where it once stood. In its place is an aarakocra with brilliantly colored plumage. Using telepathy, it reaches out to each of you in turn and introduces itself as Necalli. "I am released from a duty long forgotten," it says. "The world has rolled back more than fifteen hundred years. Now, history can be rewritten."
>>
>>The city is no longer trapped deep beneath the Reghed Glacier. Instead, it drifts among the clouds, its spires and other structures agleam and undamaged. A skycoach glides overhead, bathing you briefly in its shadow before making its way toward the city's glass-enclosed skydock.
>>
>>Weaving between the city's spires are boulevards traversed by tall humans of noble bearing in wizardly robes, many of them accompanied by hairless, green-skinned humanoids that serve as their valets and bodyguards. Some take note of your presence, while others gawk at the empty space where the obelisk once stood.
>>

Necalli, a **couatl** shapechanged into the form of an aarakocra, doesn't remember why it was bound to the obelisk or by whom. It knows only that it is free of its obligation to the obelisk's builders. It does its best to convince the characters that the obelisk is gone forever, along with nearly two thousand years of history. Necalli can administer healing to wounded characters, after which it assumes its true form and departs. It takes no action that might harm another creature.

Ythryn is now a floating, living city under the rule of the **lich** Iriolarthas and his apprentices, the Wizards of the Arcane Star (eight evil **archmages**). Almost every other inhabitant of the city is either a Netherese **mage** or a green-skinned magen (described in appendix C). When not partaking in their studies and revels, the Netherese focus their efforts on finding ruins of Ostoria, the ancient empire of giants. It is toward this supreme goal that all of the city's resources are directed.

The obelisk is gone, erased from history, leaving the characters stranded. They are now stuck in Ã¢ÂÂ343 DR. If the characters warn Iriolarthas about the fate that awaits Ythryn and recount the circumstances leading to its fall, the lich takes steps to ensure that history does not repeat itself, including but not limited to keeping Ostorian relics away from the *Ythryn mythallar*. In exchange for their information, Iriolarthas gives the characters a skycoach to expedite their departure from the city. Characters who flee rather than allow themselves to be detained can commandeer a skycoach and plot a course away from the city. A skycoach has the statistics of an *airship* (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*), but its magic wanes quickly unless it's recharged using magic foreign to the characters. Soon, the skycoach struggles to remain aloft, forcing the characters to set down and salvage what they can from the vessel.

To put it mildly, the characters have a whole new world to explore. Ten-Towns doesn't exist in this timeline, nor do most of the cities along the Sword Coast that characters might recognize. Many tribes of Reghed nomads prowl Icewind Dale, while Uthgardt tribes descended from Netherese claim vast tracts of untamed land south of the Spine of the World, kept in check by marauding monsters. The Empire of Netheril controls the lush, temperate lands doomed to become the desert of Anauroch. The town of Illusk (still centuries away from becoming Luskan) surrounds the brooding Hosttower of the Arcane. Characters hoping to visit some past version of Waterdeep or Neverwinter find nothing but unsettled land surrounded by the remnants of the elven kingdom of Illefarn. Humans won't begin farming the plateau above Deepwater Harbor (the future site of Waterdeep) or building the settlement of Eigersstor (later renamed Neverwinter) for another three centuries.

To run a campaign set in this earlier time frame, you will need to delve into earlier products tied to the Forgotten Realms to get the lay of the land circaÃ¢ÂÂ343 DR. Of course, once the characters move beyond the strongholds of civilization, the Realms of the past is very much like the Realms of the presentÃ¢ÂÂa land of mystery, with old ruins and lost dungeons waiting to be explored. Only now the characters are poised to witness the inevitable fall of Netheril, or find a way to stop it.

## Alagondar Scion

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/195-AppB-Secret-Alagondar-Scion.webp)

*Prerequisite: You must be a human, half-elf, or half-orc to have this secret. If you don't meet this prerequisite, draw a different card.*

I'm a scion of the Alagondar bloodline and the only known heir to the crown of Neverwinter. If Dagult Neverember, the city's lord-regent, learns that I'm alive, he'll send assassins to kill me.

## Doppelganger

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/196-AppB-Secret-Doppelganger.webp)

I'm a shapechanger. I have none of the traits of the race I'm imitating, but I retain my class features, background, and alignment. I have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. I can use an action to do either of the following at will:

- I can innately cast *detect thoughts*, requiring no components. My spellcasting ability is Intelligence. The spell's Wisdom save DC is 8 + my proficiency bonus + my Intelligence modifier.
- I can polymorph into any humanoid I have seen or back into my true form. My statistics, other than my size, don't change. Any equipment I'm wearing or carrying isn't transformed. I revert to my true form when I die.

## Drizzt Fan

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/197-AppB-Secret-Drizzt-Fan.webp)

I once met the famous drow ranger Drizzt Do'Urden! In fact, I have a tattered piece of his famous green cloak and would never think to part with it.

## Elusive Paramour

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/198-AppB-Secret-Elusive-Paramour.webp)

A wealthy pasha in Calimshan has placed a bounty on my head for seducing his favorite concubine. Bounty hunters are scouring the Sword Coast in search of me, but I hope they'll never think to look in Icewind Dale.

## Escaped Prisoner

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/199-AppB-Secret-Escaped-Prisoner.webp)

I was brought here from another world by spacefaring mind flayers. The ship in which I was imprisoned crashed in the mountains south of Ten-Towns. After surviving the crash, I nearly froze to death crossing the tundra to reach Ten-Towns. If some friendly trappers hadn't found me, I would have perished. I fear some of my captors also survived the crash and might come looking for me.

## Littlest Yeti

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/200-AppB-Secret-Littlest-Yeti.webp)

I was raised by yeti. Although I relied on my ferocious guardians for food and warmth and never quite adapted to the cold, I speak Yeti and have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence yeti or improve their attitudes.

## Midwinter Child

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/201-AppB-Secret-Midwinter-Child.webp)

Auril the Frostmaiden has blessed me, for I was born on the Midwinter holiday. I have resistance to cold damage.

## Old Flame

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/202-AppB-Secret-Old-Flame.webp)

I have a lover in Ten-Towns whom I haven't seen in years. At any time outside of combat, I can decide who the lover is by choosing an NPC in Ten-Towns that I can see. Once I make this choice, I can't change it. This old flame is friendly and helpful toward me, even if our past is checkered.

## Orc Stone

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/203-AppB-Secret-Orc-Stone.webp)

I saved the life of an orc, who gave me a *stone* with the symbol of the Many-Arrows tribe (a humanoid skull pierced by three arrows) carved into it. The stone is an uncommon magic item that requires attunement, and only I can attune to it.

As an action, I can use the stone to summon the spirit of an orc warrior, which appears within 30 feet of me. The spirit uses the **orc war chief** stat block in the *Monster Manual* and disappears after 10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit points. The spirit understands any language I speak and obeys my commands.

After the stone is used three times, it turns to dust.

## Owlbear Whisperer

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/204-AppB-Secret-Owlbear-Whisperer.webp)

Owlbears are predisposed to like me.

If I am within 10 feet of an **owlbear**, I can use an action to make a DC 10 Charisma (Animal Handling) check. On a success, I change the owlbear's attitude toward me from hostile to indifferent or from indifferent to friendly.

## Pirate Cannibal

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/205-AppB-Secret-Pirate-Cannibal.webp)

I served aboard *Dark Duchess*, a pirate ship from the city of Luskan. After the vessel got stuck in the ice, everyone but the captain abandoned the vessel and fled to Ten-Towns. We got lost in a blizzard along the way. I was the only one who made it, and only by eating my mates. The ship and its treasure are still out there.

## Reghed Heir

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/206-AppB-Secret-Reghed-Heir.webp)

*Prerequisite: You must be a human, half-elf, or half-orc to have this secret. If you don't meet this prerequisite, draw a different card.*

I am the offspring of **Queen Bjornhild Solvigsdottir**, leader of the Tiger Tribe. My mother cast me into the Sea of Moving Ice when I was a young child as a sacrifice to Auril the Frostmaiden. A polar bear pulled me from the water and spared me a freezing death. This bear then transformed into a goliath who bore me safely to Ten-Towns. I remember the goliath's nameÃ¢ÂÂOyaminartokÃ¢ÂÂbut haven't seen her since. I owe her my life, just as I owe my mother a merciless death.

## Reincarnation

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/207-AppB-Secret-Reincarnation.webp)

I died and was brought back to life by a friendly human druid using the *reincarnate* spell. I have no idea what became of the druid, whose name I don't know. I retain the memories of my previous life, some or all of which was spent in Icewind Dale. (Roll on the table in the spell's description to determine your character's previous race, or choose a race from the table that you like, then flesh out the story of your previous life.)

## Ring Hunter

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/208-AppB-Secret-Ring-Hunter.webp)

I am looking for the **knucklehead trout** that bit off my father's finger, which had a signet ring on it. To preserve my inheritance, I must retrieve the lost ring.

## Runaway Author

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/209-AppB-Secret-Runaway.webp)

I penned a notorious exposÃÂ© called "The Hellbent Highborn," which accused several prominent patriars in Baldur's Gate and nobles in Waterdeep of being devil worshipers. Although my accusations were well founded, I made a lot of enemies and was forced to seek refuge in Icewind Dale.

## Slaad Host

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/210-AppB-Secret-Slaad.webp)

A **red slaad** implanted a pellet-sized egg in me shortly before I started my adventuring career. If I can't get rid of it in the next two months, the egg will gestate inside me, and a slaad tadpole will burst from my chest, killing me. It will then quickly grow into an adult slaad and kill even more people.

## Spy

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/211-AppB-Secret-Spy.webp)

I'm a spy for the Harpers, a secretive organization that works behind the scenes to thwart tyrants and other evildoers. My mission in Icewind Dale is to safeguard the settlements of Ten-Towns while concealing my Harper affiliation. Credible threats to Ten-Towns include the Arcane Brotherhood, an organization of wizards based in Luskan, and the Zhentarim, an expansive shadow network that wants to control trade throughout the North. Both have threatened Ten-Towns in the past.

My only Harper contact in Ten-Towns is a human named Beldora, who poses as a homeless woman and spends her days gathering information in Bryn Shander.

# Appendix C: Creatures

This appendix describes new creatures that appear in the adventure, presenting them in alphabetical order. The introduction of the *Monster Manual* explains how to interpret a creature's stat block.

Several of the creatures in this appendix are common beastsÃ¢ÂÂfoxes, hares, mountain goats, seals, sperm whales, and walrusesÃ¢ÂÂthat live among other beasts from the *Monster Manual*, such as polar bears, deer, elk, **reindeer** (use the **elk** stat block), killer whales, mammoths, moose (use the **giant goat** stat block), saber-toothed tigers, snowy owls, woolly rhinoceroses, and wolves. And then there's the notoriously ugly knucklehead trout, without which there would be no Ten-Towns.

If the adventuring party includes a wizard who can prepare the *find familiar* spell, consider allowing the wizard to add the fox and the hare to the spell's list of eligible familiars.

### Arcane Brotherhood

The Arcane Brotherhood is a cabal of powerful wizards that operates out of the Hosttower of the Arcane, a multi-spired structure that towers above Luskan (a city south of Icewind Dale on the Sword Coast). The brotherhood's leadership consists of five renowned archmages who handpick the other members, favoring wizards of great accomplishment. Every year, scores of wizards from across FaerÃÂ»n flock to the Hosttower of the Arcane, hoping to gain admittance into the prestigious ranks of the brotherhood. Nearly all candidates are dismissed out of hand, without so much as a test, feeding rumors that the brotherhood's leaders are more interested in marketing their own brand of exclusivity than finding new talent. Yet wizards seem willing to debase themselves regardless, for admittance to the brotherhood grants access to the Hosttower's incredible libraries of magical lore.

The truth behind the brotherhood's ongoing quest for new members is based on the adage, "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer." The brotherhood's leaders seek out wizards who might by their exploits compete with the brotherhood's acquisition and hoarding of arcane lore and magical secrets. By bringing these wizards into the fold, the brotherhood turns potential enemies into colleagues, in effect neutralizing future threats.

Once welcomed into the brotherhood, wizards are free to pursue their own interests so long as they place the security and sanctity of the Hosttower and the cabal above all else. When not rallying to defend their home, wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood act like friendly and unfriendly rivals to one another, striving to outdo their peers in magic. Open conflict between members is forbidden, yet members are adroit at finding underhanded ways to needle and sabotage one another.

The Arcane Brotherhood sent three of its members to investigate rumors of a lost Netherese enclave that crashed in Icewind Dale nearly two thousand years ago. A fourth wizard, Nass Lantomir, learned about the expedition and decided to form her own.

Not long after they arrived in Bryn Shander, the three wizards who had formed the initial expeditionary force parted company, each one determined to be the first to find the enclaveÃ¢ÂÂsuch is the fragile nature of wizardly alliances. The four wizards are described below:

**Avarice**, an albino tiefling evoker with a pair of gargoyle companions

**Dzaan**, a human illusionist and Red Wizard of Thay who perished recently, but whose simulacrum lives on

**Nass Lantomir**, a human diviner who died and now exists as a spellcasting ghost

**Vellynne Harpell**, a human necromancer from a famous family with a cadre of koboldsÃ¢ÂÂsome living, others undead

### Goliaths

At the highest mountain peaksÃ¢ÂÂfar above the slopes where trees grow, where the air is thin and the frigid winds howlÃ¢ÂÂdwell the reclusive goliaths. Few other folk can truthfully claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still to have forged a friendship with one.

Goliaths love to compete and keep score, counting up their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to what others have done. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as an incentive to improve their skills. Above all else, every goliath is driven to outdo their past performance, taking greater and greater risks. As a result, few goliaths live to see old age.

#### Goliath Names

Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn's mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name.

- **Birth Names.** Aukan, Eglath, Gae-Al, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Kuori, Lo-Kag, Manneo, Maveith, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Thotham, Uthal, Vaunea, Vimak
- **Nicknames.** Bearkiller, Dawncaller, Fearless, Flintfinder, Horncarver, Keeneye, Lonehunter, Longleaper, Rootsmasher, Steadyhand, Threadtwister, Twice-Orphaned, Twistedlimb, Wordpainter
- **Clan Names.** Akannathi, Anakalathai, Elanithino, Gathakanathi, Kalagiano, Katho-Olavi, Kolae-Gileana, Ogolakanu, Thuliaga, Thunukalathi, Thuunlakalaga

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/235-08-011.goliath-warrior.webp)

#### Goliath Player Characters

With your consent, any player in your game can play a goliath character. A goliath native to Icewind Dale can be a member of the Skytower (Akannathi) clan, the Wyrmdoom (Thuunlakalaga) clan, or another goliath clan that you and the player create together.

#### Spine of the World Goliaths

Goliaths inhabit the Spine of the World, where their mettle is tested against **orcs**, **ogres**, **frost giants**, **remorhazes**, **ice trolls**, **young white dragons**, the treacherous mountain terrain, and the cruel indifference of nature.

***Bitter Rivals.*** Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag are two mountain strongholds inhabited by goliaths. The former is home to the Skytower (Akannathi) clan, the latter to the Wyrmdoom (Thuunlakalaga) clan. The two groups refuse to get along, and competition between them is fierce and often violent. They stare at each other across mountain peaks and fight over everything from necessities to territory. The likelihood of peace between them is remote, because goliaths like to hold grudges.

### Kobolds

Kobolds can be found anywhere dragons are known to dwell, and those that live in the mountains and hills of Icewind Dale are among the hardiest of their kind. Drawn to the north by a desire to find and serve white dragons, these kobolds adapted as best they can to the hostile climate. Their sensitive eyes appreciate sunless days and long, dark nights. They use wooden javelins as tools to test the snow ahead of them.

Kobolds native to Icewind Dale frequently wander into Ten-Towns to escape the dreadful cold, hoping to trade what few skills they have for some warm soup and shelter. The people of Ten-Towns, accustomed to the presence of strange outlanders, allow these kobolds to dwell among them for the most part. When the kobolds don't feel safe, they acquire heavy winter clothing and disguise themselves as humans by standing on one another's shoulders. Three kobolds in cold weather gear can pass themselves off as a clumsy human with a successful group Charisma (Deception) check, the DC of which equals the onlooker's Wisdom (Insight) check result.

![](img/adventure/IDRotF/240-08-012.kobolds.webp)

#### Icewind Kobold Zombie

The necromancer **Vellynne Harpell** has Icewind kobold guides in her employ, including a pair that died and were turned into **zombies** using *animate dead* spells. The cold climate helps to preserve their dead flesh.

#### Kobold Vampire Spawn

The **gnoll vampire** Tekeli-li has a small number of **kobold vampire spawn** minions to keep it company in the Caves of Hunger (see *chapter 6*). The vampiric kobolds are terrified of the gnoll vampire and can't understand its commands, so they give Tekeli-li a wide berth. These ravenous undead kobolds thirst for blood and tend to swarm one foe at a time.

### Magen

Magen are magical, humanlike beings created by a wizard spell (see the *create magen* spell in *appendix D*) or by other arcane methods.

Though magen look like humanoids with green skin, they are constructs. When one is wounded, its blood is seen to have the color and consistency of mercury. They exist purely through magical means. When one is killed, its body disappears in a burst of harmless fire and a cloud of smoke that quickly dissipates.

***Magical Servants.*** Magen make ideal servants. At creation, each is instilled with an instinct to protect itself and its creator, and it follows its creator's instructions without hesitation. When its task is complete, a magen stands immobile and silent until its creator gives it new orders.

- **Demos Magen**
- **Galvan Magen**
- **Hypnos Magen**

### Reghed Nomads

Reghed nomads are the children of the Reghed Glacier, as suggested by their name. They are people of the wild, as revealed by their tribal namesÃ¢ÂÂthe Elk, the Tiger, the Wolf, the Bear. They are the tribes of Icewind Dale, proud and strong, bound to ancient traditions that have kept them alive through countless harsh winters. The Reghed wear heavy furs as well as gloves, boots, and masks made of animal hide, to protect themselves from the bitter cold.

Although they originally descended from humans who were predominantly blue-eyed and fair-haired, the Reghed tribes have assimilated other folk, adding new blood to their dwindling ranks. There used to be more than four Reghed tribes, but the others have all disbanded over the past century, with many of their former members settling in Ten-Towns and abandoning their traditional ways.

The Reghed tribes rely on a nomadic lifestyle to survive, as they follow herds of **reindeer** along the route of the animals' annual migration. When they make camp, the tribesfolk live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by wooden shafts. (See *map 2.11* for a typical Reghed camp configuration.)

The *Monster Manual* has stat blocks that can represent most members of a Reghed tribe, as shown in the Reghed Tribesfolk table.

##### Reghed Tribesfolk
| Role                                    | Stat Block                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hunter or **warrior**                   | **Tribal warrior** with Survival +4; speaks Common                                      |
| **Shaman**                              | **Druid** with Survival +4; speaks Common and Druidic                                   |
| **Clan chieftain** or **great warrior** | **Gladiator** with hide armor instead of studded leather and Survival +5; speaks Common |

![Reghed hunters of the four tribes](img/adventure/IDRotF/249-08-016.reghed.webp)

#### Tribe of the Bear

Internal strife has splintered what remains of the Bear Tribe today. The turmoil began shortly after a band of Bear Tribe hunters recovered pieces of chardalyn from the frozen corpses of several dwarves. Oblivious to the demonic magic suffusing the crystal, tribe members used the shards to fashion heads for their spears and axes. Contact with the crystal corrupted these warriors over time, turning them into **chardalyn berserkers**. Their cruelty forced the king to banish them from the tribe. These outcasts have since begun raiding Bear Tribe camps for sacrifices, which they offer up to Auril to gain the Frostmaiden's favor.

#### King Gunvald Halraggson

The thirty-year-old Bear King cuts an impressive figure and is renowned for his size and strength. He tries to be honorable, but he is often merciless and doesn't change his mind easily. He has trouble relating to Ten-Towners, so he avoids them. His perspective on townsfolk might change if they helped him destroy the chardalyn berserkers who have turned against their own.

Gunvald has had three wives in six years, each of whom died while she was pregnant. His advisors fear that the gods have cursed Gunvald and the entire tribe. In truth, the king's doting shaman, Ulkora, lusts for him and surreptitiously poisoned his wives. In time, Ulkora hopes Gunvald will turn his loving eye toward her and allow her to bear his true heir. If Gunvald were to learn the truth, he would put Ulkora to death.

#### Tribe of the Elk

Of the four remaining Reghed tribes, the Tribe of the Elk is the largest and the most tolerant of outsiders. It's also the tribe of the hero Wulfgar, son of Beornegar.

Members of the Elk Tribe view the people of Ten-Towns as "tame folk," who are ill bred and ill equipped for life in Icewind Dale. The tribe keeps its distance from Ten-Towns to avoid misunderstandings, since the appearance of Elk Tribe hunters near Ten-Towns has been known to panic Ten-Towners who live in constant fear of attack.

#### King Jarund Elkhardt

The Elk King is **Jarund Elkhardt**, a terse yet thoughtful giant of a man who is nearly fifty years oldÃ¢ÂÂancient by tribal standards. He has led the Elk Tribe for over half his life, and age has made him cautious. He has seen other kings and queens rise and fall, has made war with friends and peace with his enemies, and has led warriors he knew as babes to their deaths in battle. The strain of his long years of rule is etched on his weather-worn face.

Jarund's late son, Jarund Twice-Born, was killed almost a decade ago while trying to bring down a cave bear, leaving Jarund without an heir. He has failed to produce another child with his wife, Wynneth, and his mistress, Froya, so the future of his royal line remains uncertain.

Auril's unyielding winter concerns Jarund deeply, and he often turns to his shaman, **Mjenir**, for guidance. The king respects the shaman's understanding of gods and spirits, and the fact that both men have lost their sons serves to strengthen the bond between them. **Mjenir** believes that the only way to break Auril's spell is to slay the goddess in her home, but Jarund believes that his warriors aren't strong enough to accomplish that task alone.

#### Tribe of the Tiger

The Tiger Tribe shuns the stronger Elk Tribe and preys on the weaker Bear and Wolf tribes. Of all the Reghed tribes, the Tiger Tribe is the most comfortable preying on the weakness of their rivals as well as Ten-Towns.

#### Queen Bjornhild Solvigsdottir

It's unusual for a woman to lead a Reghed tribe, but Bjornhild is a most extraordinary woman. The fearless wife of the late King Korold, she fought alongside him in many battles. After a frost giant's mammoth companion slew Korold, the formidable Bjornhild took his place.

Bjornhild worships the Frostmaiden and is so ruthless that her enemies believe she has actual ice flowing through her veins. She has no living children that she knows of, but with Auril's blessing, she won't need any heirs to preserve her legacy. Bjornhild intends to live forever by demonstrating her unwavering faith in the Frostmaiden and becoming the Chosen of Auril.

As if she weren't fearsome enough, Bjornhild has a pet **saber-toothed tiger** named Grava.

![Queen {@creature Bjornhild Solvigsdottir|IDRotF} and her saber-toothed tiger, Grava](img/adventure/IDRotF/250-08-015.bjornhild.webp)

#### Tribe of the Wolf

The Wolf Tribe is the smallest of the four remaining Reghed tribes, and even its most optimistic members don't think it will survive much longer under its current leadership. To swell its ranks, chieftains have resorted to bringing outsiders into the fold, including outcasts from Ten-Towns, disenfranchised members of other Reghed tribes, and even goblinoids.

#### Isarr Kronenstrom

The Wolf Tribe has been without a king or queen for years. Its most powerful chieftain, **Isarr Kronenstrom**, is a psychotic brute who worships Malar the Beast Lord. He hunts Ten-Towners for sport, bathes in their blood, and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. Several members of Isarr's clan have deserted him or been killed off, but the few that remain are fiercely loyal. They believe, incorrectly, that he's the Chosen of Malar.

Although Isarr calls himself the Wolf King, few others in the Wolf Tribe support him in that claim, but the other Wolf clan chieftains are too weak and disorganized to challenge him.

>We bow to She who wears the crown; Let the world shiver with dread. Clad in winter's whitest gown, Her snow enshrouds the dead.
>
>Her fury sheds but frozen tears as gray clouds issue forth. Her wind across the wasteland shears, bringing blizzards from the north.
>
>Ice-kissed flowers caught mid-bloom, beauty kept in all its grace. Summer's gone to its silent tomb, stilling in Her cold embrace.
>
>All the world in winter's white, sheathed in sleet and ice. Set upon never-ending night, She conjures paradise.
>
>Behold Her everlasting rime, see how it covers all; Weep not for those She traps in time behind Her glacial wall.
>
>Sovereign of summers lost, general of winter's war; Long live the queen of cold and frost. May She reign forevermore.
