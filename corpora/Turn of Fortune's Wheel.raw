# Introduction: Beginning of the End

Ranging from the planar metropolis of Sigil to the fringes of the Outlands, this Dungeons & Dragons adventure takes characters on a tour of remarkable realms, where they'll brush shoulders with immortals and discover a plot to forever change the multiverse.

The information in this book is for the Dungeon Master's eyes only. If you're planning to play the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now. Before running this adventure, review *Sigil and the Outlands*, which provides overviews of this adventure's settings. This adventure assumes characters aren't familiar with Sigil or traveling the planes. Use the details herein and in *Sigil and the Outlands* to help characters tour the City of Doors, the Outlands, and beyond.

## Adventure Summary

This story focuses on the characters correcting a multiversal glitch affecting them and the whole of the Outlands. The adventure begins with the characters awaking in Sigil, untethered from their lives and memories due to this unprecedented error in reality.

During the adventure, the characters discover the city of Sigil and meet the arcanaloth information broker **Shemeshka**. In return for Shemeshka's aid in recovering their memories, the characters must track down a missing modron carrying dangerous information. This leads characters on a tour of the Outlands, with the additional goal of recording their impressions of the plane using a *mimir*Ã¢ÂÂa magical, skull-shaped recording device (detailed in *Sigil and the Outlands*). During their travels, the characters reveal Shemeshka's role in their plight, recover their memories, and have the chance to stop a plot undermining the stability of the multiverse.

### A Multiversal Glitch

Sometimes the multiverse doesn't work as it should. In this adventure, characters find themselves victims of an unprecedented multiversal mistake. They each led a remarkable life, died by suspicious means, and were reborn untethered from their true pasts. This makes each character a singularity of existential uncertaintyÃ¢ÂÂa being that the laws of the multiverse contort around as planar forces fail to identify their logical place in reality. This has the following effects on the characters:

- **Causal Uncertainty.** Characters have confusing memories of multiple possible or previous lives. These impressions are vague and conflicting.
- **Physical Fluctuations.** The multiverse isn't certain who the characters are or where they're supposed to be. Whenever a character dies, a probable incarnation of that character manifests nearby. Players will have the opportunity to customize and play these incarnations of their characters.

In *part 3* of this adventure, characters learn about themselves, their true memories return, and their place in the multiverse solidifies, unlocking lost abilities and revealing the characters' actual nature. The "*Glitch Characters*" section provides details on creating and running characters affected by this multiversal glitch.

### Adventure Structure

This adventure has three parts, as follows:

*Part 1: Schemes in Sigil* introduces characters to the city of Sigil and the multiversal glitch that has severed them from their previous lives. In their explorations of the City of Doors, they'll meet Shemeshka, Sigil's foremost information broker, who can surely discover details of their past lives.

*Part 2: Into the Outlands* sees the characters journeying to the Outlands at Shemeshka's request to recover a modron fugitive called **R04M**. As the characters explore the Outlands, they'll visit surreal locations, lay claim to a walking castle, learn how to find **R04M** using a damaged magic item called a *mimir*, and witness unnatural events plaguing the plane.

*Part 3: Unity of Rings* reveals Shemeshka's role in a planes-warping plot and sees the characters recover their memories and lost abilities. From there, the characters must save a group of lost modrons carrying information dangerous to the stability of the planes and ultimately decide whether to maintain the status quo of the multiverse or reshape it to their design.

## Running the Adventure

To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks (*Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*). In addition, you need the other two books included in this product: *Sigil and the Outlands* and *Morte's Planar Parade*.

>>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>>

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, you better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." Usually, you can find the stat block in the *Monster Manual*; if the stat block is in *Morte's Planar Parade*, the adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*, while magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text directs you to *Sigil and the Outlands*.

### Directions on the Planes

Surreal locations like Sigil and the Outlands don't exist on planets with clearly defined cardinal directions. Nevertheless, maps and descriptions throughout this adventure refer to north, south, east, and west for ease of use. See *Sigil and the Outlands* for details on navigating these settings.

### Using the Poster Map

*Sigil and the Outlands* contains a fold-out, double-sided *poster map* intended to be shared with the players at certain points in the adventure. One side of the poster map depicts the *city of Sigil*, while the reverse side shows the Outlands. These maps and the landmarks they depict aren't to scale, as both Sigil and the Outlands are vast and ever-changing, making them beyond the scope of traditional cartographic methods. Nevertheless, the location of places relative to one another prove useful as characters navigate these surreal locales. The adventure tells you when to show these maps to your players.

### Starting Characters

Characters start this adventure at 3rd level. Players can create new 3rd-level characters, as described in the next section. If the players wonder why characters start at this level and don't recall what came before, ascribe it to the multiversal glitch the characters are experiencing.

*"I am a mimir, a magical device designed to provide information. If you have stolen me, please be aware that, even now, bounty hunters are coming to claim me for justice."*Ã¢ÂÂ Standard mimir introduction
#### Character Creation

Characters of any origin are suited for this adventure. As the DM, you decide what character options are available to your players. Consider allowing players to choose from the *character options* in *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse* when creating their characters. If you want to include characters who hail from Sigil, a gate-town, or other places where planar travel is common, consider using the *character options* in *Sigil and the Outlands*.

To create 3rd-level characters for this adventure, players should use the character-creation steps outlined in the *Player's Handbook*. In addition to more hit points, class features, and spells, each character has normal starting equipment plus 250 gp to spend on additional nonmagical gear. Each character also gains one uncommon magic item of the player's choice, subject to your approval.

### Character Advancement

At the end of many of the adventure's chapters, each character receives enough experience points to advance 1 level, putting them at the level they should be for the next chapter. Much of *part 2* can transpire in any order, with the characters advancing 3 levels, as detailed in *chapter 4*. At the conclusion of *chapter 14*, characters gain multiple levels at once. The Character Advancement table notes what level characters should be at the start of each chapter of the adventure. Characters who finish the adventure advance to 18th level.

##### Character Advancement
| Part     | Chapter           | Character Level |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| *Part 1* | *Chapter 1*       | 3rd             |
| *Part 1* | *Chapter 2*       | 4th             |
| *Part 1* | *Chapter 3*       | 5th             |
| *Part 2* | *Chapter 4*       | 6th             |
| *Part 2* | *Chapters 5*Ã¢ÂÂ*12* | 6thÃ¢ÂÂ9th         |
| *Part 2* | *Chapter 13*      | 9th             |
| *Part 3* | *Chapter 14*      | 10th            |
| *Part 3* | *Chapter 15*      | 17th            |

## Glitch Characters

Once players have created their characters, ask each player the following questions and have them record their answers:

**What was the greatest decision or turning point in your character's life?** If your character made a different decision, how might their life be different? How would they be different if they made choices based on others' expectations?

**What is something your character wishes they could change about themselves?** How would the best version of themselves be different?

**What is your character's signature possession or physical trait?** What makes you certain that your character would retain this no matter what could have happened in their life?

![Wizard, paladin, and druid incarnations of the same glitch character share a distinctive sunburst nexus feature](img/adventure/ToFW/001-00-001.glitch-character.webp)

### Character Incarnations

In this adventure, each character has not just a single form, but three incarnations. These incarnations share the same level and advance at the same time, but they can otherwise be as different or similar as the player wishes. Incarnations might use completely different character options, they might have different physical forms, or they might simply have cosmetic differences. A player plays only one incarnation at a time, switching incarnations only when one dies.

It's up to you when players create their character's other incarnations. Consider the following options:

- **Surprise Incarnations.** If you want players to discover their characters' incarnations at the same time their characters do, have them create one character at the start of the adventure. During the adventure, the first time a character dies, invite all the players to create two variant versions of their character using the guidance in this section, then continue the adventure.
- **Prepared Incarnations.** If you want to create characters only once, have players create their first character and two variations before the adventure begins.

When creating different character incarnations, players should review their answers to the questions from the previous section and consider how different choices might have led their character down different paths.

*"Sometimes infinity gets it wrong."*Ã¢ÂÂ Chronepsis, draconic guardian of time
#### Nexus Feature

Nexus features are distinguishing objects or traits shared among a character's incarnations. They are icons of a character's personality or signature tokens. Nexus features help others recognize a character no matter which incarnation is being played. Have players determine a nexus feature by creating their own or rolling on the Nexus Features table.

##### Nexus Features
|  d4 | Nexus Feature                             |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A notable scar or birthmark               |
|  2  | A distinctive symbol or piece of clothing |
|  3  | A signature weapon or piece of armor      |
|  4  | A particular type of makeup or hairstyle  |

#### When Incarnations Die

When a character dies, the multiversal glitch restores one of that character's incarnations of the player's choice to life soon after. This incarnation must be different from the one who just died, but each incarnation doesn't need to be played before a particular incarnation reappears.

Work the incarnation's return into the adventure, following the guidance in the "Running Glitch Characters" section. Let players discover that dead characters return in new incarnations during play rather than revealing this outright. When an incarnation appears, they are attuned to any magic items the dead character was attuned to when they died.

A dead character's body doesn't vanish when another incarnation manifests. Glitch characters can be affected by spells such as *raise dead* and *resurrection* until their next incarnation appears. Spells that permanently alter characters, such as *reincarnate*, continue to affect an incarnation even after they die and return.

### Running Glitch Characters

Use the guidance in this section when portraying the glitch that affects characters in this adventure.

#### Incarnations Returning

After dying, glitch characters return as one of their other incarnationsÃ¢ÂÂeven if those incarnations have died before. Once a player chooses which incarnation to play, have that incarnation reappear several minutes after the character's death as is convenient. Planar forces cause incarnations to appear in unlikely places, like in empty rooms, around bends in the road, or inside wardrobes. Let other characters happen across the incarnation rather than having incarnations rejoin the party on their own. Incarnations have no memory of how they came to be wherever they're found. If a character dies during combat, their next incarnation shouldn't appear until after the combat encounter ends.

#### Threatening the Unkillable

When a glitch character dies, they return as another incarnation. Let characters enjoy their unique situation. If a character wants to sabotage a massive machine by throwing their body into its gears or embrace similarly wild schemes, let them do so.

Combat encounters remain challenging, as incarnations don't return until after an encounter ends. If all characters die during an encounter, it's up to you how to proceed. Incarnations of all the characters might reappear far from where they were defeatedÃ¢ÂÂperhaps in the last settlement they visited. This might occur minutes, days, or even years after the characters' defeat. They're then free to reattempt challenges, though the threats have likely recovered.

#### Returned but not Reinvigorated

Use your discretion to determine whether incarnations return with all their expendable character featuresÃ¢ÂÂlike spells or uses of traits. If having an incarnation return with their full suite of options would make the adventure less exciting, don't have the incarnation reappear until after the group finishes a long rest, or have the incarnation reappear with their class features expended. It's fine for death to be an annoyance, even for those who defy it.

#### New Characters

If a player wants to play a new character, you can have glitch characters leave the party or die permanently for mysterious reasonsÃ¢ÂÂa glitch is, by definition, unreliable. New characters introduced experience the same multiversal glitch.

Alternatively, events during the adventure might reveal unexpected insights about a character's past. At your discretion, a character might change their incarnations, effectively becoming a new character. Work to tie such changes into meaningful character developments or adventure milestones. Characters shouldn't be able to manifest new incarnations customized to overcome specific challenges.

> ##### Don't Rush Eternity
>
>The multiverse might be falling apart, but there's no need to rush. Let characters explore Sigil and the Outlands at their leisure. Particularly when exploring the Outlands, days, months, or even years might pass as the party travels. There are no deadlines on this adventure's plots, and the threats the characters face will take ages to unfold. Use the time to feature locations from *Sigil and the Outlands* as you please, then get back to the adventure when it suits you.
>

### Ending the Glitch

In *chapter 14*, the glitch ends, and each player chooses which incarnation is their character's true self. From this point forward, party members function as normal charactersÃ¢ÂÂalbeit powerful ones.

### Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins when the characters awake in the Mortuary in Sigil, a morbid fortress that disposes of the city's dead. The characters have their equipment, but they aren't familiar with their surroundings, how they got there, or Sigil itself. Moreover, the characters' memories of their pasts are unreliable. They know the gist of their traits, but other details about themÃ¢ÂÂincluding their namesÃ¢ÂÂare vague. Learning how the characters lost their memories is revealed in the course of the adventure.

# Part 1: Schemes in Sigil

![The floating skull {@creature Morte|ToFW} welcomes some less-than-dead adventurers to the Mortuary](img/adventure/ToFW/002-01-001.splash.webp)

## Chapter 1: Grave Escape

The characters have died, but their adventures are far from over. Victims of a multiversal mishap, they awaken with hazy memories in the basement of the Mortuary, a foreboding monument to death located in the Hive Ward of Sigil (detailed in *chapter 2* of *Sigil and the Outlands*). Headquarters of the Heralds of Dust, a faction of undertakers and Undead, the Mortuary is a living tomb where the dead are interred, cremated, or raised to serve the Heralds of Dust. Surely, someone in the City of Doors can help the characters learn about their pasts, but the characters must first escape their gloomy prison before its wardens lay them to rest.

### Hey, Chief!

When you're ready to begin play, read the following text:

>>You awaken on a metal examination table in a dim, windowless stone chamber. The air is cold and stale, tinged with the acrid sting of formaldehyde emanating from a nearby shelf of clouded flasks and antiseptic jars. Dried blood stains the drab, mosaicked floor and the edges of your table, and pained moans haunt the halls beyond the stuffy room.
>>
>>A human skull floats nearby. It bobs impatiently, watching you with slate-gray eyes that remain in its lidless sockets.
>>
>>The skull notices you're awake and greets you with a nasal voice. "Hey, Chief!"
>>

The talking skull is **Morte** (see his stat block in *area M1*), a curmudgeonly interplanar traveler plucked from his eternal punishment in the Nine Hells. Tormented by the lies he told in life, **Morte** masks his pain with a morbid sense of humor and an insufferable dose of sarcasm.

#### Talking with Morte

**Morte** is friendly toward the characters and does his best to answer their questions. In conversation, the skull addresses each character as "Chief" or some other inoffensive but still unflattering nickname.

As a result of the *multiversal glitch* affecting the characters (see this book's *introduction*), they don't remember much about themselves and don't know why they're in the Mortuary. **Morte** can answer the following questions or otherwise provide this information:

- **Who Are You?** **Morte** describes himself as a debonair planes traveler who died too young. If asked about the whereabouts of his body, **Morte** quips he never really had a good head on his shoulders or claims to be the skull of the archlich Vecna.
- **Where Are We?** The characters are in the Mortuary in Sigil, an interplanar hub at the center of the Outer Planes. If they ever see the light of day again, they're in for a real treat.
- **How Did We Get Here?** To have wound up in the Mortuary, **Morte** reckons the characters must've died and been wheeled in, just like everyone else.
- **How Do We Leave?** **Morte** doesn't know the way out, but he does know the Heralds of Dust, who run the Mortuary, don't take kindly to "fleshies" poking around. He tells the characters to "shake a leg" and make their escape while they still can.

If the characters ask **Morte** to accompany them, the skull declines, mentioning that he's waiting for someone else. He doesn't elaborate further.

The characters will have other questions. Seeking answers should drive them on.

### Mortuary Basement

The basement of the Mortuary is a collection of musty chambers where the Heralds of Dust, also known as the Dusters, process Sigil's dead. Cheerless faction agents prowl its halls, wheeling corpses to embalming chambers or to the crematorium. The Heralds of Dust treat the dead with reverence and dignity, granting them last rites in accordance with the beliefs of the deceased whenever possible. Heralds of Dust abhor resurrection magic, decrying it as anathema to their work.

The Mortuary has other floors besides the one presented in this chapter. See *chapter 2* of *Sigil and the Outlands* for details on *the Mortuary*.

#### Multiversal Glitch

The Mortuary is a dangerous place for 3rd-level characters. If a character dies, refer to the "*Running Glitch Characters*" section in this book's *introduction*. If all the characters die at once, they reappear back in the morgue. **Morte** heckles them on their return.

### Mortuary Basement Features

Unless otherwise stated, the basement of the Mortuary has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings are 8 feet high in corridors and 12 feet high in rooms. They are held aloft by walls of smooth stone.
- **Doors.** Doors are iron gates that squeak as they swing on their hinges.
- **Lighting.** The basement is dimly lit by sputtering *continual flame* spells cast on wall sconces grasped by iron skeletal hands.

### Mortuary Basement Locations

![Map 1.1: Mortuary Basement](img/adventure/ToFW/003-map-1.01-mortuary-basement.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/004-map-1.01-mortuary-basement-player.webp)The following locations are keyed to map 1.1.

#### M1: Morgue

The characters begin their adventure in the morgue, a sterile room where Heralds of Dust identify the dead. It is described in the "Hey, Chief!" section and contains no creatures other than the talking skull **Morte** (see the accompanying stat block).

Bolted into the floor are eight examination tables, and rusty furnishingsÃ¢ÂÂstep stools, garbage cans, and metal gurneysÃ¢ÂÂare scattered between them. Humanoid bodies, draped in dingy sheets flecked with blood, lie on any tables not occupied by the characters when they wake. Deceased commoners collected from Sigil, the corpses carry nothing of value.

***Treasure.*** The shelf along the far wall contains a *healer's kit* with three uses remaining, several flasks of embalming chemicals, a polished scalpel that functions as a *dagger*, and any equipment the characters begin play with.

#### M2: Autopsy Room

>>This sterile chamber reeks of embalming fluids. A mortician in a bloodstained apron hunches over a humanoid amalgam of patchwork flesh. Elbow deep in its flayed-open chest with a pair of surgical instruments, this grim doctor causes the corpselike creature to twitch and writhe with her movements.
>>

Jex, a wispy-haired **Heralds of Dust remnant** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*), dissects a **flesh golem** in the autopsy room. The cold-hearted mortician is trying to locate a key she accidentally dropped inside the golem during a routine grafting procedure.

Becoming one of the faction's undertakers after a failed attempt at lichdom, Jex drank from a magical goblet that burned away her jaw. Her features have since been reconstructed with translucent wax.

If either creature becomes aware of the characters, the golem sits upÃ¢ÂÂits exposed chest cavity on displayÃ¢ÂÂand the horrified mortician tells the characters they're supposed to be dead. Both creatures attack.

***Treasure.*** The golem's chest contains the key to the locked drawer in *area M4*.

#### M3: Possessions Room

This storage room houses objects confiscated from the dead. Two **poltergeists** (variant **specters**) put on a macabre puppet show for an audience of three slack-jawed **skeletons**. The spirits hover behind a makeshift curtain, using their unintelligible wails to give a pair of eerie dolls the impression of speech.

The poltergeists are indifferent toward the characters, but if the characters disturb their performance, the poltergeists attack and the skeletons join in. If a character dies in this room and later returns, the poltergeists substitute the dolls for a dance routine featuring the character's limp corpse as its star.

A character can make a DC 14 Charisma (Performance) check to act alongside the puppets. On a successful check, the skeletons applaud, and the poltergeists reward the character with a *potion of resistance (poison)* from a music box on a high shelf.

***Treasure.*** In addition to the *potion of resistance (poison)*, this room holds three faction uniforms (your choice), a purse containing 30 gp, and three trinkets (determined randomly by rolling on the *Trinkets table* in the *Player's Handbook*).

#### M4: Cold Locker

Six mortuary stretchers, chilled drawers sized for Medium creatures, line the walls of this frigid chamber. The Heralds of Dust store members of their Undead workforce here.

The drawers and their contents are as follows:

- **Drawer 1.** This drawer is jammed shut. A human **commoner**Ã¢ÂÂa pasty-faced Herald of Dust named Fruth who fell asleep on the job and was mistakenly pronounced deadÃ¢ÂÂbangs on the door from the inside, begging to be freed. The door can be opened with a successful DC 15 Strength check. If released, the shivering Herald of Dust is friendly toward the characters. However, it's his first day, and he doesn't know the way out of the Mortuary other than the way corpses come in: the chute in area M6.
- **Drawers 2Ã¢ÂÂ4.** Each of these drawers contains a **zombie** worker that groans and shields its eyes if exposed to the light. If a character disturbs an occupant further, all three of the drawers swing open, and the zombies attack.
- **Drawer 5.** This drawer is empty.
- **Drawer 6.** This drawer is locked. Opening it requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or the key located in the autopsy room (*area M2*). Inside are a jeweled goblet worth 100 gp, a manifesto of the Heralds of Dust's philosophies, and a *spell scroll* of *animate dead*.

![The zombie Maurice dutifully attends one of the Mortuary's deluxe-sized crematoriums](img/adventure/ToFW/006-01-002.zombie-mortuary.webp)

#### M5: Crematorium

>>An ashy broom and dustpan lean against the wall outside a narrow corridor with an iron, windowed door. Two leversÃ¢ÂÂa blue lever in the upward position and a red lever turned downwardÃ¢ÂÂare set into the walls adjacent to the door. An identical door stands closed at the end of the passageway.
>>

Centrally located, this crematorium is a 30-foot-long, 5-foot-wide chamber accessible by Undead workers on both ends. Miniature blowtorches are located in the mouths of stone faces that dot the walls of the chamber.

***Safety Lever (Blue).*** To prevent flames from escaping into the hallway, a safety lever ensures the crematorium's two entrancesÃ¢ÂÂiron doors with reinforced windows of heat-resistant glassÃ¢ÂÂare shut while its flame spouts are active.

When triggered, the safety lever causes both doors to slam shut and lock for 1 minute, during which time the bright-red furnace lever flips upward and can be triggered (see below). The doors can't be opened from either side for the duration, and both levers flip to their original orientations when the doors unlock. The furnace lever won't budge unless the safety mechanism is active.

***Furnace Lever (Red).*** When pulled, the furnace lever causes the torches set into the walls to erupt with gouts of flame. Creatures inside the fire-filled crematorium must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Zombie Worker.*** After the characters enter the crematorium for the first time, a human **zombie** wearing a name tag that reads "Maurice" appears in the window of the opposite door and triggers the safety mechanism, trapping any characters inside the crematorium for 1 minute.

Maurice then places its moldering hand on the red lever, preparing to trigger the furnace. The characters can try to distract the zombie from its task with magic or theatrics and by making DC 14 Charisma (Performance) check. On a successful check, the zombie gurgles contently and loses interest in the lever. It shuffles along when the doors unlock. On a failed check, the zombie pulls the furnace lever.

>Mortal Lessons
>
>A character could easily die in area M5. If this happens, reveal that the characters have multiple incarnations. Consult the "*Glitch Characters*" section in this book's *introduction* for details. If a character isn't slain here, seek other opportunities for reckless actions to result in temporarily mortal consequences.
>

#### M6: Corpse Retrieval

>>A metal chute is set into the wall of this foul chamber. Grisly puddles spatter the floor, and corpses topple from an overturned cart. The stench is gag worthy.
>>

Corpse collectors deliver bodies to the Mortuary in exchange for paltry sums, dumping them into 10-foot-square chutes overseen by Herald of Dust guards. The bodies slide down the steep chutes to retrieval rooms, occasionally colliding with unsuspecting occupants.

Shortly after the characters arrive, a corpse tumbles down the chute and lands with a splat, disgorging a hostile **black pudding**. As the ooze accosts the party, bodies continue to spill from the chute.

***Falling Corpses.*** On initiative count 20, creatures within 10 feet of the chute must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and have the prone condition. The chute stops ejecting corpses after 3 rounds.

***Escape.*** After dealing with the ooze, the characters can climb up a corpse chute to the surface. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The chute opens into Ragpicker's Square (see the "*Surfacing in Sigil*" section later in this chapter).

#### M7: Dining Hall

>>An ornate chandelier hangs over this lavish dining hall. Empty, high-backed chairs with decorative cushions sit before several covered platters.
>>
>>A ghostly butler rises from the floor before you, a decanter of ruby-red wine in its hand. The spirit speaks in a hollow voice, "Dinner is served."
>>

Heralds of Dust enjoy their last meals in this lavish hall before undergoing necromantic rituals. The table is set for the number of characters in the party.

Kingsley, a lawful evil **ghost** butler, has prepared a meal, tailoring dishes to each character's tastes. If a character removes a platter's lid, it reveals their favorite food, masterfully prepared. Let each player describe what meal awaits their character.

The dinner is laced with poison. A creature that partakes in any food or drink in this room must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Treasure.*** The silverware on the table is collectively worth 200 gp.

#### M8: Burial Grove

>>Snow blankets this quiet, indoor grove of icy brambles. Carcasses worn by time lie partially buried in the sleet and ice. A skeletal, black-barked tree looms over the gloomy orchard. Its branches bear a single fruit.
>>

Bodies undergo a slow, natural decay in this funereal thicket. Three spindly **dryads** oversee the decomposition, ensuring no one disturbs the process. The dryads allow the characters into the grove, mentioning that though the characters walk as the living do, they stink of death.

A Gulthias tree (see the "Blights" entry in the *Monster Manual*), surrounded by brambles, rises above the thicket. It bears a single, bone-white fruit resembling an apple. A creature that eats half or more of the fruit takes 70 necrotic damage. The dryads don't stop characters from picking the fruit.

#### M9: Records Room

>>A floating feline skull with gemstone eyes hovers above an aged desk strewn with elegant stationery. Deep in thought, the skull chews a black fountain pen in its ink-stained, bony fangs. A sea of crumpled papers is strewn throughout the chamber, and dusty scrolls line pigeonholes along the walls.
>>

The records room is the lair of Thaeziagnuz, a **demilich** poet tasked with eulogizing Sigil's dead. Thaeziagnuz can speak, read, and write Common. Once a tabaxi bard of great renown, Thaeziagnuz has a case of writer's block. Piles of crinkled obituaries surround the skull's desk.

The cranky demilich is initially indifferent toward the characters. When the characters enter, the Undead poet laments its situation and asks them to help it complete a brief epitaph for a member of the Doomguard who drowned in a bathhouse yesterday. A character can try to improve Thaeziagnuz's epitaph by making a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion or Performance) check. On a successful check, the demilich becomes friendly toward the characters; on a failed check, it howls in frustration. If the character fails this check a second time, the demilich attacks until the characters retreat from the room.

***Pigeonholes.*** Death certificates fill a network of cubbyholes around Thaeziagnuz's desk. A character can locate their own death certificate by searching for it and succeeding on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Curiously, one field remains blank on each of the characters' death certificates: their cause of death.

#### M10: Hallway

The stairway in this musty hallway ascends to a cellar door at the edge of the Mortuary's grounds near the Hive Ward (see the following section). An iron gate at the south end of the corridor leads to other areas in the Mortuary, but they are beyond the scope of this adventure.

### Surfacing in Sigil

When the characters exit the Mortuary, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>You emerge from the Mortuary into a dilapidated city square. Stacks of jumbled tenementsÃ¢ÂÂgrimy hodgepodges of lopsided architecture joined by rickety bridgesÃ¢ÂÂloom over the persistent, low-hanging fog.
>>
>>An impossible city unfolds around you. Bladed buildings rise on all sides, the urban sprawl spreading along the inside of a gigantic torus. The metropolitan ring curves upward into passing clouds, disappearing behind the haze.
>>

Here ends chapter 1. Each character should gain a level before starting the next chapter.

## Chapter 2: Philosophers with Clubs

The characters emerge from the Mortuary and find all of Sigil before them. Before running this part of the adventure, review *Sigil and the Outlands*. Use this chapter to familiarize characters with Sigil and get a taste for what it has to offer. After meeting the tout Parisa, the characters can explore as they please. When you're ready for the adventure to proceed, run the "*Harmonium Officers*" encounter.

### A Tout to Help You Out

After leaving the Mortuary, the characters emerge in Ragpicker's Square in the Hive Ward. There they meet their first local, an irritable tiefling **commoner** with devilish hooves who bumps into them in the street. Flustered and clearly in the wrong, the tiefling spins around and berates the characters:

>>"Take a short stick and pike it, you leather-headed berk, or I'll put your name in the dead-book! I swear, more and more of you clueless wind up in the Cage every day. Quit flapping your bone boxes, and go back to your own burgs."
>>

The tetchy pedestrian might be either a planar wanderer spouting nonsense or a Sigil resident embellishing their speech with local slang. Before the exchange can escalate, a spunky **bariaur wanderer** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) named Parisa intervenes and tells the tiefling to scram; the commoner continues along their way with a sneer.

Parisa scrapes a living in Sigil as a tout, a guide to the City of Doors. Brazen, street savvy, and a little mischievous, the bariaur knows all the local hot spots and the portals that lead to them. She offers her services to the party for just 3 gp per day. If they refuse, the characters can explore the city on their own or find another guide. Alternatively, you can have Parisa reappear later in this chapter.

*"It's daunting, isn't it? The sudden feeling that everything and everywhere are now at your fingertips. Don't worry; I won't lead you astray. Where do you want to go first?"*Ã¢ÂÂ Parisa, Sigil tout
### Exploring Sigil

*Chapter 2* of *Sigil and the Outlands* describes life in Sigil and the locations on the poster map. Use this information, along with the random encounter table in each ward's section, to bring the multiversal hub to life. Sigil is a metropolis with manifold attractions; feel free to add in adventuring sites of your own creation.

How long the characters spend in the City of Doors is up to you, but they should have enough time to take a long rest before the Harmonium spoils the fun (see the "*Sigil Encounters*" section).

#### Map of Sigil

If the characters accept Parisa's services, show your players the *poster map of Sigil* to guide their characters' exploration. The map simulates the tout's extensive knowledge of the city's layout, wards, and noteworthy sites.

If the characters decline the guide, they can purchase a map of the city (use the poster map) for 10 gp in any shop that caters to visitors. However, without a guide, the characters might be unfamiliar with some, if not all, of the locations denoted on the map.

#### Sights and Wonders

Parisa or any other unofficial guide can recommend the following activities to the characters:

- **Eat Planar Grub.** From the eclectic street foods of the Grease Pit to the posh cuisine of the Gastrognome, Sigil offers a taste of the multiverse.
- **Get Ink at Fell's Tattoos.** A **dabus** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) named Fell runs a tattoo parlor in the Hive Ward. For 10 gp, Fell can give a character a magic tattoo that functions as a nexus feature (see "*Glitch Characters*" in the *introduction*). He can later remove it for the same amount.
- **Rest at the Ubiquitous Wayfarer.** Accessible via dozens of planar portals, the Ubiquitous Wayfarer is a friendly, three-story tavern in the Lower Ward. Its proprietor, Riaen Blackhome, rents rooms for 2 gp per night.
- **Say a Planar Prayer.** No power is too obscure to worship in the Lady's Ward, where demonic cultists and goodly priests erect temples side by side.
- **Send a Squeak.** A guide introduces the characters to the pervasive rodents called **cranium rat squeakers** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) and explains how to communicate using them.
- **Shop at the Great Bazaar.** Anything and everything is sold in the bustling avenues of the Great Bazaar: equipment, food and drink, even magic items.
- **Visit a Faction's Headquarters.** Sigil is home to twelve ascendant factions, which perform important city functions. Some are friendlier than others, but characters who have the Planar Philosopher background and their comrades enjoy easy access to their factions' headquarters and amenities.

#### Who Am I?

The core mystery of this adventure surrounds the characters' identities and the nature of their deaths. While the characters retain vague, surface-level details about themselves, they're likely to seek more information in places such as the Hall of Records in the Clerks' Ward or the Institute for Intellectual Excellence in the Market Ward. Ultimately, the answers they find are either unsatisfying or nonexistent, and no one knows how the characters died.

Despite their predicament, the characters can learn minor details about themselves through experiences in Sigil. They might discover they have a fear of needles after visiting Fell's Tattoos or realize they have more refined tastes after partaking in cheap food or drink. Consider awarding *inspiration* (see the *Player's Handbook*) whenever such observations happen.

![Parisa the bariaur tout guides visitors wherever they want to go in Sigil](img/adventure/ToFW/007-01-003.parisa-guides-visitors.webp)

### Sigil Encounters

The following encounters can be introduced anywhere in Sigil. While the first two are optional, the "*Harmonium Officers*" encounter marks the end of the exploration portion of this chapter and moves the adventure's plot forward.

#### Sensory Experience

A **Society of Sensation muse** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) in a flowery gown approaches the characters, eager to record a new sensation in their *sensory stone* (see *Sigil and the Outlands*). Roll on the Sensory Stone Sensations table and consult the entries below to determine the muse's desired sensation and how the characters can help them elicit it.

##### Sensory Stone Sensations
|  d6 | Experience |
|:---:|------------|
| 1Ã¢ÂÂ2 | Fear       |
| 3Ã¢ÂÂ4 | Joy        |
| 5Ã¢ÂÂ6 | Serenity   |

- **Fear.** A character can cause fear in a passing **commoner** with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check accompanied by a threatening gesture or ominous interaction. On a failed check, the characters record the citizen's contempt instead.
- **Joy.** The Sensate points the characters to a sobbing child (noncombatant) holding a broken toy. A character can brighten the child's spirits with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check or by repairing their toy. On a failed check, the characters record despair instead.
- **Serenity.** To record serenity, the Sensate directs the characters to a **satyr** musician nervously preparing for a street-side performance. A character can calm the satyr's nerves with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check or the *calm emotions* spell. On a failed check, the characters record anxiety instead.

If the characters record the Sensate's desired sensation, the muse rewards them with a *sensory stone* of their own. Otherwise, the Sensate recommends the characters get better in touch with their emotions and departs.

#### Planar Philosophers

Intellectuals from three factionsÃ¢ÂÂthe Athar, the Bleak Cabal, and the Mind's EyeÃ¢ÂÂare locked in debate in a public forum, such as the Trianym outside the Hall of Speakers. The quarrelers consist of a strident **Athar null**, an apathetic **Bleak Cabal void soother**, and an uplifting **Mind's Eye matter smith** (see *Morte's Planar Parade* for these stat blocks). Their dispute concerns the legitimacy of gods in the grand scheme of the multiverse. Their bombastic arguments have drawn a small crowd of spectators.

#### Three Arguments

The crux of their arguments are as follows:

**The Athar** vigorously asserts that the gods are false powers, pointing to their dead husks in the Astral Sea as evidence that they're unworthy of worship.

**The Bleak Cabal** agrees with the Athar but goes on to say that nothing has meaning, not even this debateÃ¢ÂÂthe multiverse is a cruel existence.

**The Mind's Eye** disagrees with both of the others, claiming that the gods are legitimate and that every individual can become one. True potential lies within; it's an ingot waiting to be forged.

#### What Do You Think?

Having reached an impasse, the philosophers turn their attention to the characters, asking them to weigh in. The debate resolves in one of three ways:

- **One of You Is Right.** If the characters side with one of the three philosophers, that debater rejoices. Afterward, the agent invites them to tour their faction's headquarters: the Shattered Temple (Athar), the Gatehouse (Bleak Cabal), or the Great Foundry (Mind's Eye).
- **Another Faction Is Right.** If the characters disagree and instead support another faction in Sigil, the philosophers dismiss the characters. Shortly afterward, a spectator in the crowd approaches the characters as a representative of that faction and invites them to the faction's headquarters.
- **None of You Are Right.** If the characters conclude that no faction is right, or support two or more arguments, the philosophers groan and disperse. A few stragglers hang around afterward to voice support for the characters' new philosophy.

If the characters visit a faction headquarters, they're provided details on the faction's philosophies and welcomed to join, if they so choose. See *Sigil and the Outlands* for details on the *factions*.

#### Harmonium Officers

Sigil's tripartite of justiceÃ¢ÂÂthe Fraternity of Order, the Harmonium, and the MercykillersÃ¢ÂÂhas learned of the character's multiversal glitch, whether from the Heralds of Dust or a creature that witnessed the characters' spontaneous resurrection. The Guvners deploy a cadre of Harmonium officers to place the characters under arrest.

When you're ready to end the exploration, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>A hush washes over the area, eclipsed by the march of heavy boots. Three officers of the HarmoniumÃ¢ÂÂburly guards in spotless, red plate armorÃ¢ÂÂbrandish menacing, clawed polearms in your direction.
>>
>>"Halt, criminal!" demands one of the peacekeepers, a squinting human with a gold front tooth. "You're under arrest for violating the laws of the multiverse. We can do this the easy way." The menacing jaws on the Harmonium officers' polearms snap open with a clink. "Or the hard way."
>>

The three **Harmonium peacekeepers** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) command the characters to drop their weapons and come quietly. The officers have been ordered to bring the characters before the High Courts of Sigil, where the characters must stand trial for supposed crimes against reality.

Parisa distances herself from the characters on seeing the Harmonium officers. She apologizes to the characters, briefly mentioning she "can't go back to the Prison" before fleeing the scene.

The Harmonium officers attempt to detain the characters with their pincered polearms and walk them to the city courts. Failing that, they try to knock the characters unconscious and place them in shackles.

#### Development

Whether they evade the Harmonium pursuers or get caught, the characters eventually meet **Farrow**, detailed below. The circumstance of this introduction depends on whether the characters escape or are captured, as detailed below:

- **Escape.** If the characters defeat or evade their pursuers, they quickly run into **Farrow**, who helps them lie low in a nearby establishment as Harmonium backup arrives on the scene.
- **Capture.** If the characters are bested, Harmonium officers detain them with manacles that function as *dimensional shackles*. The manacles' magic fades if they are opened or destroyed. As the characters are taken to the city courts, **Farrow** arrives disguised as a Harmonium officer named **Josbert Plum**. After unlocking their manacles, "Josbert" helps the characters flee the guards to a safe place nearby.

![{@creature Farrow|ToFW} and Their Alter Ego {@creature Josbert Plum|ToFW}](img/adventure/ToFW/008-01-004.farrow-and-plum.webp)

#### Farrow, Shadar-kai Spy

**Farrow** was once a member of a covert network of shadar-kaiÃ¢ÂÂelves shaped by the magic of the ShadowfellÃ¢ÂÂon a Material Plane world known as Mystara. Hurled into the Cage after a failed mission on their home world, **Farrow** has since acclimated to the City of Doors and put their talents to use. They have curly white hair, ashen skin, and a purplish birthmark on the right side of their face.

The shadar-kai serves the arcanaloth **Shemeshka** as one of her most reliable agents, using a magic ring that functions as a *hat of disguise* to infiltrate the many factions of Sigil. **Farrow** has a disguise for each ascendant faction, along with a few others. When **Farrow** dons a disguise, they become a new person entirely, losing themself in the role until the spell wears off. Each alter ego pledges fealty to Shemeshka, but only she knows **Farrow**'s many faces are one and the same. **Farrow**'s signature birthmark persists across their disguises.

***Faces of Farrow.*** In addition to their true form (a neutral, elf **spy**), **Farrow** regularly dons the following disguises, replacing their game statistics with those of a *Sigil faction agent* (detailed in *Morte's Planar Parade*):

**Aza Dowling**, a self-indulgent tiefling **Society of Sensation muse**.

**Josbert Plum**, a belligerent human **Harmonium peacekeeper** with a blonde buzz cut.

**Kal the Crisp**, a freckled gnome **Hands of Havoc fire starter** with a penchant for destruction.

If reduced to 0 hit points while disguised as an alter ego, **Farrow** reverts to their true form. Any excess damage carries over to that form.

***Mysterious Patron.*** **Farrow** has been observing the characters from afar. The shadar-kai understands the characters' identity crisis and believes Shemeshka can help, but the spy doesn't disclose their employer's name due to Shemeshka's dire reputation; **Farrow** hopes they've done enough to earn the characters' trust in the meantime.

**Farrow** offers to guide the characters through Undersigil, a maze of tunnels beneath the city, to their patron's safe house. It's too risky to travel the streetsÃ¢ÂÂbefore the characters know it, every Harmonium officer in Sigil will be looking for them.

If the characters accept **Farrow**'s guidance, **Farrow** leads them to the closest entrance to Undersigil, a boarded-up archway in the basement of a nearby building. If the characters decline, **Farrow** tells them it's their funeral; the Harmonium will continue to return in greater numbers until the enforcers succeed, and next time, **Farrow** might not be there to bail out the characters.

### Undersigil

**Farrow** knows a path through Undersigil to Fortune's Wheel, a casino owned by Shemeshka. Though the shortcut avoids the Harmonium officers, the tunneled realms beneath Sigil bring their own dangers, as detailed by the encounters in this section. For more information about *Undersigil*, see *chapter 2* of *Sigil and the Outlands*.

On entering Undersigil, **Farrow** cautions the characters to keep their wits about them.

#### Stuffed Rat

Soon after the characters begin their travels in Undersigil, read the following description:

>>A tunnel leads through a half-collapsed basement. At the center of the chamber, a rat with an exposed brain and a bloated stomach lies belly-up on a porcelain plate scattered with pink crumbs. As the rodent meets your gaze, you hear a low voice in your mind. "Do what you must," it says. "We have already won."
>>

The speaker is a **cranium rat squeaker** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*), a scout for a cranium rat collective known as the Us, which is scouting new territory. The rat uses the pronouns "we" and "us" when referring to itself. Overwhelmed by the sweet scent of dessert, the rat abandoned its mission and gorged itself on cake here moments ago. Its belly full, the rat has the incapacitated and prone conditions and is indifferent to the party.

If the characters leave the defenseless rat in peace, it gives them a cryptic warning about the tunnels beyond: "Beware the scent of strawberry." If the characters harm it, the rat lets out a telepathic shriek, and a hostile **cranium rat squeaker swarm** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) pours out from nearby cracks to avenge it.

#### Twisted Tea Party

**Farrow**'s shortcut takes the characters through the territory of the Coterie of Cakes, a dwindling faction of bullies and bakers who believe the multiverse is a giant, multilayered cake. Forced into Undersigil when their faction didn't quite take, the Cakers aggressively knead nonbelievers into members of their cake-based contingent.

![Map 2.1: Caker Tea Party](img/adventure/ToFW/009-map-1.02-caker-tea-party.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/010-map-1.02-caker-tea-party-player.webp)Eventually, the characters happen on a Caker tea party in a flooded chamber, emerging from the tunnel to the north. Map 2.1 depicts the area. When the characters arrive, read the following text:

>>A strawberry cake decorated with leathery wings rests on a festive table in this damp, dimly lit chamber. Wet sediment collects around floor drains, and gaping sewer pipes protrude from the stone walls. The other end of the tunnel is barred shut.
>>
>>Four rosy-cheeked humans in grimy baker's attire sit at the table, sipping tea with pinkies extended.
>>

Four CakersÃ¢ÂÂchaotic evil, human **thugs** whose maces are rolling pinsÃ¢ÂÂprattle on about the "misguided" surface factions of Sigil over cake and tea. The Cakers are initially indifferent toward the characters. Normally, the Cakers don't take kindly to interruptions, but the struggling coterie is eager to recruit new members.

When the characters make themselves known, the troop's ringleaderÃ¢ÂÂa pink-haired Caker named **Gertrube**Ã¢ÂÂinvites them to take a seat and join the absurd celebration. If the characters can endure 10 minutes of teatime without offending their hosts, the Cakers allow them to proceed unimpeded. However, if the characters decline their offer or otherwise insult the Cakers during the mealÃ¢ÂÂto refuse a slice of cake is an unforgivable blunderÃ¢ÂÂthe Cakers politely ask to be excused, push in their chairs, and attack.

![{@creature Gertrube|ToFW} invites visitors to a Caker celebration in Undersigil](img/adventure/ToFW/011-01-005.gertrube.webp)

#### Cursed Cake

Unable to secure fresh ingredients in Undersigil, the Cakers prepped this pastry with the blood of a vargouille. A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the wings have black blood; they don't belong to a bat or any other Beast.

Creatures other than Constructs, Fiends, or Undead that partake of the cake are cursed. Over 1d4 hours, a cursed creature's head takes on fiendish aspects. At the end of this time, the creature dies, and its head tears from its body as a hostile **vargouille reflection** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). Casting *greater restoration*, *remove curse*, or a similar spell on the target before this transformation completes ends the curse and undoes its effects.

#### Cursed Cakers

The Cakers have eaten the cursed cake. Makeup masks their languid complexions, but a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight or Medicine) check determines the Cakers aren't well. If a Caker is reduced to 0 hit points, a hostile **vargouille reflection** sprouts from their corpse.

#### Portals

Each of the lettered sewer pipes on *map 2.1* contains a portal to one of the others in this room. The pipes are large enough for a Medium or smaller creature to pass through without squeezing. A creature that enters a pipe emerges on the other side of the pipe with the matching letter on map 2.1. The Cakers know the destinations of each pipe and use them to their advantage in combat.

#### Treasure

Among the Cakers are two stale baguettes, three mincemeat pies, and a lemon tart. Additionally, **Gertrube** carries a *portal compass* (see *Sigil and the Outlands*).

### To Fortune's Wheel

After the characters deal with the Cakers, the remainder of the journey through Undersigil is uneventful. They emerge from Undersigil in the Lady's Ward, about a block from Fortune's Wheel.

When the characters arrive, read the following:

>>You stand before the giant marquee of a casino that reads "Fortune's Wheel" in a dazzling font. Fashionably dressed locals laugh, arm in arm, as they push through the casino's polished gold revolving door to the gambling hall within.
>>
>>**Farrow** lets out a satisfied sigh. "This is the place."
>>

Here ends chapter 2. Each character should gain a level before starting the next chapter.

## Chapter 3: Fortune Favors the Bold

The characters arrive at Fortune's Wheel, a planar casino in the Lady's Ward owned by the Shemeshka the Marauder. As they wait for the arcanaloth to arrive, the characters experience the gambling hall, its games, and its colorful clientele. At the end of the evening, Shemeshka promises to investigate the characters' pasts if they agree to do her a favor.

### Warm Welcome

The door of Fortune's Wheel opens into the Dragon Bar. When the party enters, a polite, snappily dressed tiefling bellhop (**commoner**) named Valek delivers a letter to them that reads as follows:

>>Honored guests,
>>
>>Welcome! I've been expecting you. Don't fret; you're safe here. Our city's so-called "peacekeepers" hold no sway in my establishment.
>>
>>I've prepared accommodations for each of you upstairs. Valek will show you to your rooms. Rest, relax, and enjoy room service on me. When you're ready for entertainment, a gift awaits you at the casino cage.
>>
>>I'll be down a bit later. See you soon.
>>
>>Your benignant host, Shemeshka
>>

Valek shows the characters to their rooms: luxurious suites fit for royalty on the second floor. A clean set of fine clothes awaits each character.

Valek caters to their basic needs, offering to shine equipment, answer questions about the casino, or provide a short tour. Valek expects a tip of at least 1 sp for each service. If the characters fail to tip Valek, he remains courteous but becomes faintly aloof.

With the characters in Valek's capable hands, **Farrow** wishes the characters good luck and departs the casino.

*"Come on, mama needs a new octet of shoes!"*Ã¢ÂÂ Alta Addercop, drider gambler
#### Planar Proprietor

Shemeshka's reputation precedes her. Characters who question **Farrow**, Valek, or other locals about her might learn the following details:

- **Arcanaloth.** Shemeshka is an influential arcanaloth who takes pride in her appearance. She owns Fortune's Wheel and appears in the casino regularly.
- **Influencer.** She's fantastically wealthy and an information broker par excellence.
- **Spy Master.** Powerful in her own right, Shemeshka also commands a loyal web of spies that could bring the city's factions to their knees overnight.

![Wealthy and daring gamblers from across the planes mingle at the Fortune's Wheel casino](img/adventure/ToFW/012-01-006.fortunes-wheel.webp)

### Fortune's Wheel

Fortune's Wheel is a casino where risk-takers from across the multiverse place bets.

#### Tracking Time

The characters have enough time to finish a long rest. After this, they have 3 hours before Shemeshka arrives on the casino floor. They can use this time to explore Fortune's Wheel, play games, and interact with fellow gamblers. Use the games detailed in the following sections and the encounters in the "*Timed Events*" section to fill the time. Don't worry about managing things to the minute. If the players are having fun, give them time to enjoy the casino.

#### Casino Games

Games of chance are scattered throughout the casino. Most involve the elements here.

#### Razorleaves

Due to the infinite currencies in Sigil, the games in Fortune's Wheel use razorleaves: gambling chips unique to the casino. A razorleafÃ¢ÂÂor simply a "razor"Ã¢ÂÂlooks like a gold-hued token inscribed with stylized razorvines. Each razorleaf is worth 10 gp.

Most games cost 1 razorleaf to play. Characters can exchange their earnings for gold or purchase additional razorleaves at a *casino cage* (detailed later in this chapter).

#### Gamblers

The Fortune's Wheel Gamblers table details NPCs the characters might encounter in the casino. Use these individuals to bring Fortune's Wheel to life through social interactions or by including them as quirky rivals for characters playing casino games.

##### Fortune's Wheel Gamblers

### Fortune's Wheel Features

The casino has the following features:

- **Casino Ambiance.** The casino floor drums with the sounds of shuffling cards, loudmouthed patrons, ratcheting clockwork slot machines, and live performances emanating from its grand stage.
- **Lighting.** Gaudy chandeliers with magic orbs keep the entire casino brightly lit.
- **Security.** Six well-dressed **mezzoloth** bouncers patrol the casino. The bouncers investigate suspicious activity and respond to aggressive guests. At your discretion, they also investigate if the characters win too often at any one game.

### Fortune's Wheel Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.1. The compass and cardinal directions on the map are provided for ease of use.

![Map 3.1: Fortune's Wheel](img/adventure/ToFW/013-map-1.03-fortunes-wheel.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/014-map-1.03-fortunes-wheel-player.webp)
#### F1: Dragon Bar

The Dragon Bar is an extravagant reception area where gamblers gather before hitting the casino proper.

When the characters enter, the **ghost** of a washed-up stage magician known as the Great Stephen Amber is performing sleight-of-hand tricks for an audience of a few dozen low-stakes **noble** gamblers and three **gnoll** hecklers.

At the southeast corner of the bar is a simple door minded by an **oni** bouncer named Vez. The oni ensures that only those who meet Shemeshka's thresholds for wealth and interest are admitted to *area F3*. He has orders to welcome the characters.

***F1a: Bar.*** A sculpture of a red dragon head protrudes from the wall above this mirrored bar, which is tended by a dead-eyed, lawful neutral **equinal guardinal** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) named Brayson. He is taciturn but friendly.

***F1b: Hotel Access.*** A staircase near the main entrance ascends to a carpeted hallway of numbered, five-star suites. These accommodations exist in demiplanes accessible by guests and casino staff, or anyone else in possession of a room's portal key.

***F1c: Kitchen.*** Five **steam mephit** chefs prepare meals for guests in this hectic kitchen.

***F1d: Stage.*** Opening acts take place on a small, curtained stage. Between shows, performers can be found in a dressing room adjacent to the stage.

***F1e: Wheel.*** This room, reminiscent of a museum exhibit, houses the original fortune's wheel: an eye-catching, vertical iron cartwheel. Gilded payouts decorate its weathered surface, including one coveted gold square that once paid out ludicrous sums. This roulette has since been decommissioned, replaced by the one in *area F7*.

#### F2: Casino Cages

Here gamblers can cash out their winnings or purchase razorleaves for 10 gp apiece. An attentive **imp** cashier sits behind each barred window, retrieving chips and funds from secure portals only they can access. There are two cages in Fortune's Wheel: one in the Dragon Bar with two cashiers and a slightly larger office in the casino proper with three.

***Welcome Gifts.*** When the characters first visit one of the casino cages, a teller gives them each a black satin bag containing 10 razorleaves. If the characters aren't already aware of the casino beyond the Dragon Bar, an imp encourages them to speak with Vez the oni.

#### F3: Illusory Fountain

>>Heavy doors swing inward, revealing a jingling fountain of gold coins rising from the floor of an extravagant gambling hall. The glittering spout originates from the open palm of a statue depicting a confident arcanaloth cast in solid gold. The fountain's inscription reads, "Fortune Favors the Bold."
>>
>>Hundreds of people from across the planes congregate around all manner of games, refreshments, and performances in this lavish, magical casino.
>>

This golden statue depicts the casino's owner, Shemeshka. The coins are an illusion. Physical inspection of the fountain, a *detect magic* spell, or a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals them as such.

***Scrying Statue.*** Creatures in the security room (*area F10*) can see and hear through the statue as if they were standing in its place. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the statue.

***Treasure.*** The statue is worth 5,000 gp, but damaging any part of it draws the immediate ire of two **mezzoloth** bouncers in the crowd nearby.

#### F4: Slot Machines

The first time a character approaches a slot machine, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>A wiry-haired night hag jumps for joy before a boxy clockwork machine fitted with a hand lever. The machine's three, faintly glowing reels display the images of two gray worms and a golden ring. "Come to mama," giggles the hag as three writhing grubs wiggle from the dispensary slot and into a brass bucket at her feet.
>>

![Duodrone Slot Machine](img/adventure/ToFW/015-01-08.slot-machine.webp)

Putrice, a friendly **night hag**, just hit it big on the slots, a maze of gambling machines. Most of the slot machines are clockwork cabinets of gnomish construction, but four are stationary, indifferent **duodrones** that work for the casino. As she pockets the worms for use in dark rituals, Putrice is happy to explain how the luck-based machines work.

A game of slots costs 1 razorleaf to play. When a participant inserts a chip into the machine, roll three d6s. Each number on the die corresponds to a symbol displayed on the slot machine's reels and its prizes, as shown on the Slot Machine Results table. Prizes are dispensed from a slot at the base of the machines.

There are four possible outcomes when playing slots:

- **One of a Kind.** If the reels display three different symbols, the participant doesn't win a prize. The slot machine produces a sad trumpet noise.
- **Two of a Kind.** If the reels display two identical symbols, the participant wins the two-of-a-kind prize listed on the Slot Machine Results table for that symbol.
- **Jackpot.** If all three symbols match, the participant wins the jackpot prize listed on the Slot Machine Results table for that symbol. Each jackpot can be won only once. Subsequent jackpots for a given symbol result in a two-of-a-kind prize.
- **Modron Time!** If the reels display a tooth (2), a gear (4), and a pitchfork (6) in any order, the four duodrone slot machines do a coordinated jig, and the participant gains the ability to reroll one or more of the d6s on their next pull of a slot machine lever, as fortune tilts in their favor.

#### F5: Table Games

Various games take place at velvet-lined tables in this open area. Three games are detailed below; at your discretion, Fortune's Wheel might contain other table games of your own creation. The buy-in for a table game is 1 razorleaf per game unless anyone is feeling lucky and wants to up the ante.

The dealers at each table game are indifferent toward the characters. Dealers abstain from combat but defend themselves if threatened. A **mezzoloth** pit boss watches over each group of tables, keeping an eye out for cheaters and troublemakers.

![Dare to test your luck with a spin of fortune's wheel](img/adventure/ToFW/016-01-09.spin-the-wheel.webp)

***Dead Hand's Dice.*** A **vampire** croupier coalesces from a cloud of mist to conduct dead hand's dice, a dice game popular among spacefaring pirates in the Astral Sea. The rules are as follows:

- Each participant's player chooses any number of d6s (known as "bones") and shakes them in a cup.
- You choose any number of d6s as well, and roll for the dealer and participating NPCs.
- Everyone rolls and reveals their dice at once.
- The participant with the highest total wins, but anyone who rolls a 1 automatically loses.

***Olidammara's Bounty.*** Named after a god of revelry, this game is played on a long table embroidered with a flat pattern of an unfolded, twenty-sided die. The game's dealer is also its deciding piece: a **spectator** shaped like an icosahedron that rolls itself on the table once all bets have been placed to determine the outcome. The rules are as follows:

- **Participant Bets.** Participants bet on one or more numbers between 1 and 20. To place a bet, a participant places at least 1 razorleaf on that number's triangular space on the game table. There's no limit to how many numbers a participant bets on, but they must wager at least one chip for each number.
- **Dealer's Roll.** After all bets are placed, the dealer rolls itself. Roll a d20; if the number on the die matches a number on which the participant bet, the participant collects five times the amount of chips they wagered. Chips wagered on any other numbers are lost.

#### F6: Big-Ticket Prize

This area displays a gilded *apparatus of Kwalish*, a prize that can be won by spinning the fortune's wheel in area F7. If the characters take the apparatus for a joyride, two **mezzoloth** bouncers arrive in 3 rounds and demand the characters vacate the apparatus or be escorted to their room by force.

#### F7: Fortune's Wheel

>>This hall holds the game after which the casino is named: fortune's wheel. The dazzling, upright roulette wheel, decorated with blinking lights and prizes galore, rises from an ornate stage of its own. A plush throne sits before the wheel before a marble platform fitted with a coin slot and a large level.
>>

Fortune's wheel is the casino's signature experience: an exciting game of chance where fortunes are won or lost. The fortune's wheel consists of three concentric spinning wheels and measures 10 feet in diameter. It occupies its own roped-off stage.

***Spinning the Wheel.*** Fortune's wheel costs 5 razorleaves per spin, and a creature is allowed only one spin every 24 hours (the wheel doesn't function if more spins are attempted). To play, the participant sits in the chair, inserts the chips into a slot in the pedestal, and pulls the lever. To determine the result, roll a d10 and consult the Outer Wheel column of the Fortune's Wheel Results table, following its instructions or comparing the result to the entries below. The game always starts on the outer wheel and ends with a single result.

The wheel is magical. Any physical prize winnings appear before the stage after each game.

##### Fortune's Wheel Results

***Bag.*** The participant wins a *bag of holding*.

***Big-Ticket Prize.*** The participant wins the gilded *apparatus of Kwalish* in *area F6*. The apparatus remains in Fortune's Wheel for the evening. At your discretion, Valek can arrange for the apparatus to be delivered to the characters in the Outlands during *part 2* of the adventure.

***Coin.*** The participant wins 50 gp.

***Coins, Two.*** The participant wins 500 gp.

***Coins, Three.*** The participant wins 5,000 gp.

***Compass.*** The participant wins a *portal compass* (see *Sigil and the Outlands*).

***Crown.*** The participant becomes a quasi-deity with a petty portfolio, such as dust mites, scheduling conflicts, gazebos, or three-toed sloths. Celestials and Fiends acknowledge the participant's godly status, but with no followers to boast, the participant is divine in name only. At your discretion, the winner might gain additional minor abilities related to their portfolio, such as controlling dust mites or understanding sloths. The Lady of Pain and other figures who seek to oust gods from Sigil pay the winner no attention.

***Feather.*** The participant wins a *Quaal's feather token (bird)*.

***Flask.*** The participant wins a *flask of holy water*.

***Four-Leaf Clover.*** The participant wins a *stone of good luck*.

***Fox.*** The participant wins a citrine *figurine of wondrous power (onyx dog)* that becomes a Medium fox (**mastiff**) when its command word is spoken.

***Ghost.*** The participant wins a bottle containing the soul of an unknown creature. Removing the stopper frees the soul inside, allowing it to proceed to the afterlife.

***House.*** The participant wins a property deed to a modest home in a gate-town of your choosing.

***Key.*** The participant wins a random portal key.

***Letter.*** The participant wins a *letter of recommendation* (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) penned by Shemeshka.

***Star.*** The participant gains a boon of luck (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***Stein.*** The participant wins a drink at the Ice Lounge (*area F8*).

***Sword.*** The participant wins a *+1 weapon* of their choice.

***Tentacle.*** The participant wins the still-writhing tentacle of a mind flayer. It's sticky.

***Trinket.*** The participant wins one random trinket (roll on the *Trinkets table* in the *Player's Handbook*).

***Tongue.*** The participant gains the ability to speak one language of their choice.

***Tunic.*** The participant wins a tunic sized for them that reads "I spun Fortune's Wheel, and all I got was this lousy tunic."

#### F8: Ice Lounge

Chilly fog emanates from the Ice Lounge, a bar chipped from a magic glacier. Its bartender is Phiwi, a warm-hearted **yeti** who speaks Common. The mixologist's specialty is a face-numbing cocktail called the Abominable Yes Please.

![One of the Dubious Vecna Impersonators Who Perform at Fortune's Wheel](img/adventure/ToFW/017-01-010.vecna-impersonator.webp)

***Sulking Dragon.*** Winter's Bite, a piteous **young white dragon**, sits at the bar with his head hung, fidgeting with a single gold piece as he drowns his sorrow. The coin is all that remains of the dragon's hoardÃ¢ÂÂhe gambled the rest away in a single night. Worse yet, the foolhardy dragon has racked up a 100 gp bar tab he can no longer afford. If a character pays off the dragon's debt, Winter's Bite thanks the character, calling them a "friend of dragonkind" before he departs the casino, never to return.

#### F9: Stage

A lofty, curtained stage rises at one end of the hall. Each evening, it boasts an assortment of acts. Behind the stage, performers prepare for the next act. A high-strung **satyr** stage manager, Grigsby, roves between storage spaces and a dressing room strewn with makeup and bewitching costumes.

Three acts take place on the stage:

- **Beyond Reality with Bimdom Baffletrick.** A charming illusionist in glittery, purple robes, Bimdom Baffletrick (chaotic neutral, gnome **mage**) performs arcane feats. His assistant is a friendly, white-furred **weretiger** named Felix.
- **Star Performer.** A silver-haired singer of great renown named Estrella (chaotic neutral, elf **noble**) brightens the stage each night in a shimmering sequined dress.
- **Tombstone Troubadour.** An icon from the faraway land of San CitlÃÂ¡n, Cecilia Tlapaya (chaotic good **ghost**) takes the stage dressed in a sharp suit. The short-haired troubadour haunts a pearl-white guitar and is accompanied by a brassy band of ten lawful good **skeletons**.

#### F10: Security Room

Three **nothics** sit in this dim room, staring at screens connected to invisible sensors spread throughout the casino. The nothics can hear and see through the sensors as if they were there, but they can't move them. In addition to their observation capabilities, the sensors extend the range of each nothic's Weird Insight action, allowing the Aberrations to probe the minds of suspicious patrons.

The sensors are located in the following areas:

- In front of the stairway in the Dragon Bar (*area F1b*)
- Inside the statue of Shemeshka (*area F3*)
- Directly above the participant's seat at the fortune's wheel (*area F7*)

If the nothics observe any questionable activity, they raise an alarm heard only by the mezzoloths throughout the casino, directing them to the scene.

#### F11: Private Rooms

These lavish rooms are used for private meetings or exclusive table games. In one room, three **hound archons** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) are playing dead hand's dice (see *area F5*).

#### F12. Portal to the Platinum Rooms

This unremarkable alcove stands in a back hall used by casino staff. Within is a portal that opens for creatures carrying an exceptionally rare platinum razorleaf chip. Those who brandish such a chip and step into the alcove emerge into the Platinum Rooms, which are detailed in *chapter 14*.

### Timed Events

The following events occur at the end of each hour.

#### Hour 1: Identity Thieves

Three amicable Vecna impersonatorsÃ¢ÂÂ**doppelgangers** mirroring the archlich of the same nameÃ¢ÂÂwalk the casino floor doing inaccurate but amusing impressions. The trio approaches one of the characters and begins to recite cheesy one-liners, asking the party to "give a lich a hand."

The impersonators are pickpockets who prey on the casino's patrons. While one **Vecna impersonator** distracts their target, another rummages through the mark's pocket for valuables.

A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check catches the impersonator in the act. The doppelgangers attack if they equal or outnumber the characters present. Otherwise, they attempt to break line of sight with the characters and assume new identities. Characters have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to notice the dopplegangers as long as the impersonators are still wearing their Vecna costumes.

While the impersonators were hired by Shemeshka's staff, the house doesn't condone their thievery.

#### Hour 2: Disgruntled Patron

If the characters didn't pay the bar tab of Winter's Bite, the **young white dragon** in the Ice Lounge (*area F8*), the dragon finally snaps. The dragon wreaks havoc as he heads for the stage to bully the current performer, who retreats into the dressing room. If the characters don't intervene, four **mezzoloths** arrive after 3 rounds and subdue the dragon, who continues to cause a scene as he's removed from the casino. A character who spends an action and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check can convince the dragon to stop attacking and leave the establishment.

#### Hour 3: Shemeshka Arrives

Read the following text when **Shemeshka** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) makes her appearance:

>>The lights dim, and the crowd murmurs with anticipation. Like a spotlight, a portal appears in the hall's vaulted ceiling and casts a golden glow on the casino floor. A grand, spiral staircase twists down from the portal, accompanied by an orchestral fanfare. A copper-furred, fox-headed being in an exquisite gown gracefully descends the stairs. Her arrival is met with thunderous applause.
>>

#### Roleplaying Shemeshka

Shemeshka is dignified and dangerousÃ¢ÂÂa gregarious yugoloth who emanates an aura of grace and royalty. In conversation, she is composed and cordial, exuding confidence and sophistication without appearing pretentious or insincere. However, her smiles are hollowÃ¢ÂÂa placid veneer that masks her ruthless nature. To Shemeshka, the multiverse is a chessboard. She moves her pawns deliberately across the planes, using them to further far-reaching schemes. She views her enemies the same way she does her allies: unworthy, easily manipulated, and disposable.

#### Talking with Shemeshka

As Shemeshka's guests, the characters can easily secure an audience with the casino's owner, who suggests they speak privately in *area F11*.

Once settled, the arcanaloth asks the characters if they've enjoyed themselves in her casino. If the characters respond positively, she's happy to hear it; otherwise, she smiles and tells them Lady Luck has finally found them. Shemeshka then inquires about the characters' unique plight, listens to their response, and proposes a deal.

***Shemeshka's Offer.*** The arcanaloth promises to dig up information on the characters' pasts in exchange for a favor. She asks the characters to locate **R04M**, a monodrone that vanished into the Outlands some time ago and hasn't returned. She's too busy with the casino to track him down herself.

Shemeshka claims the modron is a rogue accountant that knows sensitive information about her enterprise and her powerful associates. This is a lie. In truth, the modron is a loose end in one of Shemeshka's untold plotsÃ¢ÂÂa massive scheme involving a legion of lost modrons. Shemeshka's plans are further detailed in *part 3* of the adventure.

If a character doubts the arcanaloth's intentions, she commends them on their caution; it's rarely wise to trust a Fiend. Shemeshka assures the characters that her line of work thrives off mutual distrust and that her intentions with the modron don't concern them. What difference does it make if both parties get what they want? To sweeten the deal for hesitant characters, Shemeshka offers an immediate payment of 300 gp per character.

***Distraction.*** The arcanaloth's mission is largely a distraction. Shemeshka doesn't expect the characters to return from the Outlands anytime soon, if at all. The wheels of a grand scheme are in motion, and she wants the characters out of her affairs.

#### To the Outlands

If the characters accept her deal, Shemeshka gives the characters a piece of lapis lazuli shaped like an eye. She explains that it's a key to a portal, located in the Clerks' Ward near the base of a gigantic statue of a rearing, three-eyed horse. The portal stands in an archway and leads to the Outlands (detailed in *chapter 4*).

After providing this information, Shemeshka excuses herself, supposedly to set her agents to work hunting down details about the characters and their situation. She welcomes the characters to continue to enjoy Fortune's Wheel. The characters can explore the casino further or Sigil as they please, so long as they avoid the Harmonium.

This chapter ends when the characters use the portal to head to the Outlands. Each character should gain a level before starting the next chapter.

------

# Part 2: The Mosaic Mimir

## Chapter 4Ã¢ÂÂInto the Outlands

While Shemeshka investigates the characters' origins and the strange magic affecting the adventurers, the party travels to the Outlands in search of a fugitive modron. Their trail leads to a mysterious castle with the ability to traverse the plane. The magical fortress has recently been occupied by Fiends, which prove to be an impediment to investigating the site, learning more about the missing modron, and exploring the Outlands beyond.

![The walking castle Iedcaru endlessly explores the Outlands](img/adventure/ToFW/018-02-001.splash.webp)

### Arrival in the Outlands

When the characters emerge from the portal, read the following:

>>You find yourself standing amid ruins of weathered black marble. The last recognizable remnant of these ruins, a solitary stone archway, provides a frame for the portal you just passed through. Glittering, deep-blue sand spreads before you in all directions. Great impact divots mark the passage of something enormous. The trail leads toward a sudden transition in the terrain, where a forest of magenta trees climbs craggy hills that look like wizened faces.
>>
>>Much farther in the distance, an impossibly tall stone spire stretches from the horizon into the clouds.
>>

The portal from Sigil opens into a nameless ruin in the Outlands that is roughly halfway between the Spire and the gate-town of Torch. The portal, which leads back to Sigil, can be reopened with a piece of lapis lazuli etched with an eye. The surreal nature of the surrounding desert, forest, and hills, as well as the rapid transition between the terrains, is natural for the Outlands.

Creatures can follow the tracks toward the forest. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check knows the tracks weren't made by an animal, but rather by a large magical device or machine.

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the stone spire in the distance as the Spire that marks the center of the Outlands and atop which floats Sigil.

Characters who follow the trail find a walking castle (see the following section) after an hour of travel. Those who avoid the trail come across the castle in another direction.

*"I am a mimir, a magical device designed to provide information. I can be, be, beÃ¢ÂÂ" *Cacophonous gibberish and overlapping voices ensue.* "Infinite unlikelihood error: data not found."*Ã¢ÂÂ The Mosaic Mimir
### The Walking Castle

The walking castle Iedcaru is a treasure from ages past. It was created by githzerai as a hermitage where ascetics could travel the Outlands and meditate on the nature of realms beyond. While the castle has been forgotten by most githzerai scholars in Limbo, it remains the home of **Zaythir**, a sage who seeks to glean multiversal truths from mystical planar forces.

Iedcaru has recently seen more visitors than usual. The first was the modron **R04M**, which stopped at the castle and learned much about the Outlands. More recently, though, a host of Fiends discovered and occupied the castle. They've captured **Zaythir** and are now working to discover how to operate the castle. The Fiends' goals are up to you; they could be seeking to claim the castle and sell it as a war machine, or they might be working for Shemeshka through intermediaries seeking to track **R04M**.

When the characters come within sight of the walking castle, read the following description:

>>Amid a grove of strange trees stands an ornate tower. Around it, toppled pillars lie scattered. A short stairway rises from the ground to a stone terrace, where six openings lead into the structure.
>>

The walking castle is currently immobile. Those who climb the stairs reach *area W1*.

#### Walking Castle Features

The castle has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings in the castle are 30 feet high on the first floor and 15 feet high on other floors.
- **Doors.** Doors in the castle are stone reinforced with iron. The doors have AC 17, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. They can be broken open as an action with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Locked doors can be picked as an action with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.
- **Light.** Crystals embedded on the interior walls and ceilings of the castle fill rooms with bright light.
- **Water.** Taps in the kitchen, washroom, and workshop provide endless streams of fresh water.

### Walking Castle Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.1. The compass on the map and directions in the following descriptions are provided for ease of use.

![Map 4.1: Walking Castle](img/adventure/ToFW/019-map-2.01-walking-castle.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/020-map-2.01-walking-castle-player.webp)
#### W1: Terrace

A paved ring with a 2-foot-high lip provides a foundation for the castle. The base of the tower opens into a hall without exterior doors. Along the west and east interior walls of this hall are doors that lead to area W2. The door to the east is locked. The door to the west has been shattered inward.

A character who walks around the tower and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the perch and door to *area W4c*, 30 feet above.

#### W2: Library

>>All manner of tomes, scrolls, tablets, and folios cram the towering shelves of this airy library. An ancient wooden table surrounded by matching benches stands at the room's center, near an ornate spiral staircase that climbs through the ceiling above. To the north are statues of githzerai scholars and an alcove with a table covered in candles. To the south, in another alcove, stands a crystal sarcophagus.
>>

The library holds the collected writings of Iedcaru's scholars. The majority focus on esoteric philosophies of the Outer Planes and multiversal theories.

The spiral stairs rise to *area W3*.

***Research Collection.*** A character who spends 1 hour researching the Outer Planes here can make an Intelligence check with advantage, obtaining the knowledge sought with a successful check.

***North Alcove.*** This alcove holds two braziers, a threadbare mat, and a table covered in candles and used incense sticks.

***Sarcophagus.*** Visible through the transparent lid of this sarcophagus is the mummified body of Iedcaru's first caretaker, the githzerai scholar Laxuelu, whose name is etched on the lid. The mummy has brass eyes, and its sarcophagus can't be opened. Whenever a creature in the library speaks its desire for a text on a particular topic, the mummy's eyes magically move to look in the direction of a relevant work in the collection (if it exists).

***Treasure.*** Among the candles in the alcove sits a partially melted *candle of invocation* of a random alignment that has 1 hour of use remaining.

#### W3: Main Room

A character who listens carefully before entering this area and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear the tieflings inside discussing whether to betray someone named Thlaarsh.

When a character enters this area, read or paraphrase the following:

>>A spiral staircase emerges through the floor into this multiuse kitchen and social area. To the north, a ladder ascends to the floor above, and six simple doors ring the room. To the west are several cabinets and cooking spaces that have been pillaged, with pots and foodstuffs scattered across the floor. Two tieflings in spiked armor conspire over the table.
>>

The tieflings are neutral evil **gladiators** in the service of Thlaarsh (see *area W5*). They're hostile, but a character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check or who offers each tiefling at least 1,000 gp convinces the pair to betray their yugoloth allies. Otherwise, the tieflings scream battle cries as they fight to the death. If the characters don't silence the tieflings quickly, the Fiends in *areas W5*, *W6*, and *W7* are alerted.

Through doors to the southwest are a pantry and washroom. If a character dies in the castle, their incarnation appears in one of these rooms.

The ladder to the north leads to *area W6*.

***Supplies.*** The kitchen has been plundered, but 14 days of *rations* remain. These mostly consist of pickled radishesÃ¢ÂÂa favorite of **Zaythir**'s.

#### W4: Bedrooms

The following bedrooms surround the main room:

- **W4a.** This room has a single bed, a desk, and a cabinet containing loose robes.
- **W4b.** This room has two beds, a writing desk, and an empty cabinet.
- **W4c.** This room contains a large nest, once used by an avian scholar, and a cabinet with clothes suited for a winged wearer. A door to the east opens onto a sturdy log perch covered in old talon scratches.

#### W5: Study

If the nycaloth in this room is aware of the characters, it casts *invisibility*. When a character enters the room, read or paraphrase the following, leaving out the last sentence if the nycaloth is invisible:

>>A sizable desk stands opposite the door in this stuffy study. Cabinets, crowded bookshelves, and maps of the Outer Planes cover the room's walls. In the south corner stands a simple cot. A hulking, green-skinned figure with mighty wings and razor-sharp claws violently peruses the books, discarding those that displease it.
>>

This is **Zaythir**'s study. The **nycaloth** Thlaarsh the Gore Drinker is here, seeking ways to make the castle move. Thlaarsh attacks rival trespassers and fights to the death, but it tries to capture spellcasters, hoping to make them pilot the castle.

***Treasure.*** The desk holds **Zaythir**'s notes on the Outlands, which are written in Gith, as well as *calligrapher's supplies*. On the desk is a broken *mimir* (see *Sigil and the Outlands*) with a skull made of colorful glass shards. This *mimir* is further detailed in the "*Mosaic Mimir*" section later in this chapter.

#### W6: Castellan Chamber

If the two mezzoloths in this room were alerted by noise in *area W3*, they cast *darkness* before the characters enter. Otherwise, read or paraphrase the following when a character enters the room:

>>This chamber is dominated by a sculpture of a gigantic, humanlike figure looming over a broad, circular table. A ladder to the north descends, while a ladder to the south climbs to the floor above.
>>
>>Two four-armed, insectile creatures inspect the sculpture and table, trying to break them loose.
>>

The two **mezzoloths** attack the characters on sight and fight to the death.

***Castellan.*** The statue and table here are together a unique magical being known as the Castellan. It is dormant when the characters initially enter this room. See "*The Castellan*" later in the chapter for additional details.

***Secret Door.*** A character who investigates the south wall and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a secret door that slides open. In this space is a small table on which sit several candles and a *necklace of prayer beads* with 1d4 + 2 magic beads.

#### W7: Meditation Chamber

The lights in this room have been destroyed, leaving the area in dim light.

>>Ancient tapestries of the planes and cosmic alignments cover the walls of this simple room. Ladders descend to the floor below and rise to the level above.
>>

An **incubus** named Arcis, who serves Thlaarsh, waits in this room, guarding the prisoner on the floor above. If he heard battle in *areas W3* or *W6*, he transforms himself to look like a wizened gnome wearing the robes and tall hat of a member of the Fraternity of Order. He pretends to be a prisoner and lies to the characters, begging them to help him get out of the tower before more Fiends arrive. This is a ploy to drive the characters toward any Fiends surviving on the floors below. If none remain, he either tries to escape the tower or uses the characters to his advantage.

#### W8. Signal Tower

>>Narrow windows look out from this stark stone chamber in every direction. In the room's center stands a green crystal atop a stone pillar. A ladder descends to the floor below. Seated in a corner is a githyanki woman with long, white hair and closed eyes.
>>

The Fiends have kept the castle's caretaker, a neutral **githzerai uniter** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) named **Zaythir**, in this chamber. **Zaythir** is eager to be free and evict the devils from her home. She is further detailed in the "*Zaythir*" section.

***Crystal.*** The green crystal affixed to the pedestal is a *gem of brightness*. When the gem is lit, its light can be seen over a mile away.

### Castle's Residents

Once the Fiends are defeated and **Zaythir** is freed, the characters have access to the walking castle and the gratitude of its residents. These residents help the characters however they can.

![The githzerai {@creature Zaythir|ToFW} uses the Castellan to set the walking castle's course across the Outlands](img/adventure/ToFW/021-02-002.zaythir.webp)

#### Zaythir

**Zaythir** is a patient scholar of the planes who rarely shows extremes of emotion. If she is freed and the Fiends are driven out of her home, she's indebted to the characters. She introduces herself and can provide information on the following topics:

- **Personal Background.** **Zaythir** is a scholar of the planes who studies the Outlands and the planes beyond. She has guarded the walking castle alone for years.
- **The Castellan.** This magical being is **Zaythir**'s companion and the heart of Iedcaru. It controls the castle's movement. **Zaythir** can introduce the characters to it (see the "*The Castellan*" section).
- **Walking Castle.** The walking castle is called Iedcaru. It is a repository of learning and a place to study the Outer Planes. It was created by githzerai long ago.
- **Modron.** **Zaythir** was recently visited by a monodrone who called himself **R04M**. He had been using a *mimir* (see *Sigil and the Outlands*) to follow the path of the last Great Modron March, intending to learn truths of the multiverse. He left his *mimir* here, saying it told him where to go after visiting all the gate-towns (though he didn't say where that was). His mimir was damaged during the Fiends' attack (see the "*Mosaic Mimir*" section).

**Zaythir** knows nothing about the multiversal glitch affecting the characters, but she's happy to let them research in the castle's library. Unfortunately, the library contains no information on the characters' circumstances.

If it's clear the characters plan to explore the Outlands, **Zaythir** offers to help, both by sharing her knowledge of the plane and by letting the group travel via Iedcaru and use it as a base.

#### The Castellan

This magical wonder is inert when the characters first enter *area W6*. **Zaythir** can reactivate it with a word, at which point its body animates and the table before it projects an illusory image of the Outlands.

The Castellan has the following features:

- The Castellan is neutral and has an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12.
- The Castellan has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, and it can understand Common and Gith but can't speak. It communicates through gestures alone.
- The Castellan can cause Iedcaru to stand or sit. While the castle stands, its lowest level is 40 feet off the ground. The castle can walk at the rate of 12 miles per hour, but it can go no faster or slower.
- The Castellan controls the walking castle and is friendly toward those who rescued **Zaythir**. If the Castellan's attitude changes, a character must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince it to navigate the castle.
- The Castellan is indestructible so long as the walking castle stands.

Provide the players with the *poster map* of the Outlands, and let them use it to determine where the Castellan should navigate Iedcaru next.

### Mosaic Mimir

The Mosaic Mimir is a *mimir* (see *Sigil and the Outlands*) that looks like a human skull made of gold, silver, jade, and onyx. The *mimir* was badly damaged in the attack on Iedcaru, and it lies in pieces.

The Mosaic Mimir can be physically repaired by a character who spends an hour and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. **Zaythir** can repair it if the characters can't. While this repairs the *mimir* physically, it doesn't restore the lost information about the Outlands. The *mimir* once knew information about all the gate-towns and their portals to the Outer Planes, but it is now missing data on the following gate-towns:

- Automata
- Curst
- Excelsior
- Faunel
- Glorium
- Rigus
- Sylvania

The *mimir* is also missing data on the last Great Modron March (see "*The Last Great Modron March*"). This information still exists, but it's inaccessible until the data on the gate-towns is restored.

#### Restoring the Mimir's Data

![{@creature R04M|ToFW} the Missing Monodrone](img/adventure/ToFW/022-02-003.ro4m.webp)

The *mimir* holds the key to finding **R04M**, but it must have its missing data restored to access its Esoteric Knowledge and Planar Knowledge properties (detailed in *Sigil and the Outlands*). **Zaythir** or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check knows that the following steps are required to restore missing data to the *mimir*:

- **Planar Precision.** The mimir must be in the place it is receiving data about. In the case of a gate-town, this means being within 5 feet of a gate-town's portal.
- **Information Entry.** Whoever is attuned to the *mimir* must record a description of the location and their impression of it. This process takes 1 minute.

Use the Mimir Restoration Tracker (handout 4.1) to note the gist of reports on gate-towns and whether they seem accurate (this is relevant to the *adventure's conclusion*). Consider earnest attempts at reporting accurate even if they lack certain details. Recordings with purposeful omissions, falsehoods, or editorializing should be considered skewed.

![Handout 4.1: Mimir Restoration Tracker](img/adventure/ToFW/023-02-017.mimir-tracker.webp)

#### The Last Great Modron March

Once data on all seven missing gate-towns is restored, the *mimir* can report on the Great Modron March. It provides the following details:

- The Great Modron March is a procession of countless modrons conducted every 289 years to collect information about the multiverse and realign the workings of the plane of Mechanus.
- Untold numbers of modrons are lost during the march, and sometimes whole tangents of the march split off and get lost.
- The march enters the Outlands through the portal in the gate-town of Automata.
- The march visits all the gate-towns, then passes through the rilmani settlement of Dendradis at the base of the Spire. From there, the march ventures through portals into other planes, with a much-diminished number eventually returning to Mechanus.
- The last Great Modron March occurred ahead of schedule and experienced a heightened number of irregularities and losses for tenebrous reasons.

### Around the Outlands

**Zaythir** can help the characters piece together that to find **R04M**, they must restore the Mosaic Mimir by visiting the seven gate-towns for which it's missing data. Then, it should be able to relate the details about the last Great Modron March, which **R04M** was following. The characters might seek other sources for information about the last Great Modron March, but the event was so fraught with incongruities and lost so many modrons that it's impossible to know what tangent of the march **R04M** is following. **Zaythir** also offers to let the characters use Iedcaru as a base and conveyance across the OutlandsÃ¢ÂÂthough **Zaythir** won't leave the Outlands herself or let the walking castle travel to other planes.

>Directions in the Outlands
>
>As in Sigil, there are no literal cardinal directions in infinite planes like the Outlands. Nevertheless, maps and descriptions refer to such directions for ease of use. To aid in navigation, residents of the Outlands refer to the direction toward the Spire as "spireward." This is a relative direction, as spireward in Automata is the opposite direction from spireward from Xaos.
>

#### Adventures in the Outlands

*Chapters 5* to *11* detail exploits in the seven gate-towns where the characters need to collect information to restore the Mosaic Mimir. These seven chapters can be run in any order. *Chapter 12* provides supplementary encounters you can use at any time. The Castellan can provide the characters with an illusory version of the *poster map of the Outlands* from *Sigil and the Outlands*. Then, the characters can decide where they wish to travel.

#### Travel in the Outlands

The Outlands is infinite in size and changes constantly. This makes the distances between locations and the time it takes to get from place to place variable. How long travel takes is up to youÃ¢ÂÂit could take 3d6 days to get from one gate-town to the next closest one, or weeks, or longer. While traveling in the walking castle, the characters are safe, and encounters occur only when you choose.

Time also has little meaning, as the characters and many of the NPCs in this adventure are effectively immortal. The following chapters could take place over the course of weeks, years, or centuries, and the results would be the same. Creatures in the Outlands might experience time differently from one another, so make use of NPCs and encounters whenever or wherever you want.

#### Advancing in Level

Characters gain 1 level every time they complete two of the gate-town adventures in part 2. This is outlined on the Levels in the Outlands table. The characters will be 9th level before starting *chapter 13*.

##### Levels in the Outlands
| Adventures Completed | Advance to... |
|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
|   In two gate-towns  |   7th level   |
|  In four gate-towns  |   8th level   |
|   In six gate-towns  |   9th level   |

## Chapter 5Ã¢ÂÂAutomata: Recalibration

At the center of Automata stands a massive, toothed cog that encloses the gate to Mechanus, the plane of ultimate order. This towering gear rotates slowlyÃ¢ÂÂone booming tick at a timeÃ¢ÂÂin sync with the workings of the plane beyond. To repair the Mosaic Mimir, the characters must visit Automata's gateÃ¢ÂÂa feat easier said than done in the rigidly structured gate-town. To complicate matters, agents of chaos are eager to disrupt the town's perfect order.

Automata is detailed in *chapter 3* of *Sigil and the Outlands*. Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![Beltha and her chaotic gang operate out of the Inverse, the upside-down realm beneath Automata](img/adventure/ToFW/024-02-004.the-inverse.webp)

### Exploring Automata

*"You think Automata's straight streets and ticks and tocks are order?! Wake up! The powers of Mechanus don't want what's best for you. They want you predicable. Don't feed yourself to their machine!"*Ã¢ÂÂ Legis, former Council of Anarchy member before being imprisoned in MechanusAs the characters approach Automata, read the following description:

>>Rigid beings move purposefully through Automata's perfect street grid. Most travel in sync with the reverberating rhythm of the great, toothed gear that rises like an arch at the gate-town's center. As you near the community, your mimir rattles energetically, and the glow in its eye sockets pulses in time with the pervasive ticking.
>>

Locals can provide the characters with directions to anywhere in the town, but their instructions are precise and tediously step-by-step. To record an entry for the Mosaic Mimir, the characters need to visit the gate to Mechanus.

#### Gate to Mechanus

With its size and persistent ticking, the gate to Mechanus is the central presence in Automata. Using the gate sends travelers to a location in Mechanus designated by complicated factors predicable only to the modrons overseeing the gate.

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters approach the gate:

>>A forest of stanchions creates a mile-long path to the great mechanized gate at Automata's center. Hundreds of travelers stand in queue, seeking to pass through the gate to Mechanus. Amid the line, modron overseers orchestrate the orderly, sluggish procession to the gate.
>>

#### Guarding the Gate

The gate to Mechanus is guarded by a **decaton modron** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) and four **pentadrones**. If any of these modrons are attacked or feel threatened, they can call on more pentadrones, which arrive in 3 rounds. The guards are indifferent to the characters, and they tell anyone who approaches to get in line. It takes 19 (3d12) hours for a creature at the back of the line to reach the gate. Even then, only those with a gate-access permit may approach the gate (see "Accessing the Gate"). If anyone approaches with questions about the gate, the guards direct them to the Gate Travel Administration.

The modron guards don't allow anyone to approach the gate without approval. If anyone refuses orders to move along, the guards become hostile. They try to forcibly move dawdlers away, and they attack to subdue and arrest those who resist. Should the characters come into conflict with the modron guards, Aristimus interrupts and orders the modrons to stand down after 1 round (proceed with "*Agents of Order*").

#### Accessing the Gate

Creatures seeking to use the gate or get close enough to record data using the Mosaic Mimir must obtain an access permit at the Gate Travel Administration building nearby. This monument to bureaucracy is filled with offices, forms, modron officials, and lengthy queues. It takes 26 (4d12) hours of standing in lines and answering repetitive questions before the characters receive the exception forms they need to fill out to approach the gate. This halfling-sized stack of forms takes 1d4 days to fill out and requires a character to succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If a character fails this check, they miss a field or otherwise err and are provided a new stack of forms to fill out. These take just as long to complete as the first set of forms.

If the characters settle in for the long haul of Mechanus bureaucracy, word filters through the administration's ranks until Aristimus hears about the characters and comes to investigate their intentions after 1d4 hours (proceed with "Agents of Order").

#### Agents of Order

Aristimus (lawful neutral **githzerai futurist**; see *Morte's Planar Parade*) is the captain of Automata's guards and a member of the town's ruling body, the Council of Order. If the characters clearly want to use the gate for something other than travel to Mechanus, they come to Aristimus's attention, either at the gate or in the Gate Travel Administration. The guard captain approaches them with a job in mind. Read or paraphrase the following text to introduce Aristimus:

>>A stiff-looking githzerai man with a sharp uniform and sharper mustache approaches, sizes you up, and nods. "You seem like you're in a bit of a hurry. What business do you have in Mechanus?"
>>

Aristimus allows the characters to explain their situation. After they do, Aristimus introduces himself and shares that he's one of the town's leaders. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>"I don't see the harm in admitting you to the gate. Of course, I'll have to convince the rest of the Council of Order of your intentions. If you take care of something that's been vexing us, though, that gesture of good faith could make all the difference.
>>
>>"There are discordant elements operating in Automata. One such individual is an outlaw named Beltha. She recently stole one of the logbooks for the Concordant Express. It contains timetables, passenger lists, manifests, and more. Recover the logbook, and I'll see to it that you can use the gate as you require. And if you bring Beltha in, I'll throw in a bonus."
>>

Aristimus can also offer the following information:

- Beltha is a githzerai outlaw who operates in the underground tunnels known as the Inverse.
- If the characters return the logbook, capture Beltha, and bring her to the Hall of Order alive, he'll reward them with 2,000 gp, or half that amount if she's brought in dead.
- Beltha has a distinctive tattoo around her left eye that looks like a shattered gear.
- Getting into the Inverse isn't difficult, as many staircases, vents, and drains lead to the underground.
- Beltha has previously met contacts at the Divine Machine tavern.

Once their conversation is over, Aristimus wishes the party luck and leaves them to their business.

#### Finding Beltha

The characters have two options to track down Beltha:

- **Search the Inverse.** Characters can search the Inverse for Beltha, but doing so without a lead takes 2d4 hours. A character who then succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check locates Beltha's hideout (see "*Seeds of Chaos*"). Due to the chaotic essence of the Inverse, lawfully aligned characters have disadvantage on this check.
- **Stake Out.** Characters who go to the Divine Machine and spend 1d4 hours watching the clientele eventually see a dwarf **Hands of Havoc fire starter** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) with a tattoo on his arm that matches the description of Beltha's tattoo. This is an associate of Beltha named Xannik. A character can tail Xannik to Beltha's lair in the Inverse by succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check, or they can convince him to give up her location by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. Failing everything else, paying Xannik 200 gp gets him to give up Beltha's location.

### The Inverse

*"The Inverse isn't a mistake; it serves a vital role. All Automata's most disruptive elements shake to the bottom. We'll never be rid of such glitchesÃ¢ÂÂand most will never be a problemÃ¢ÂÂbut when one is, we know where to go to deal with it."*Ã¢ÂÂ Karol Kolcha, Automata guardAn underground complex of tunnels and machinery sprawls beneath Automata, and below that labyrinth is the inverted town of the Inverse. There, gravity pulls toward the surface, allowing rebels and outcasts to create a warped mirror of Automata where chaos reigns.

Stairs leading between the Inverse and the surface have strange angles 30 feet below the surface. There, gravity changes, and creatures descending into the depths start climbing into the Inverse. Eventually they reach a series of caverns filled with haphazardly arranged buildings and interconnected tunnelsÃ¢ÂÂas chaotic as Automata is orderly.

![Map 5.1: Inverse Hideout](img/adventure/ToFW/025-map-2.02-inverse-hideout.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/026-map-2.02-inverse-hideout-player.webp)
#### Features of the Inverse

The Inverse has the following features:

- **Chaotic Essence.** At a point 30 feet below the surface of Automata and lower, the Inverse is saturated with the essence of chaos. Due to disorientation and headaches, lawful creatures in this area have disadvantage on Wisdom checks.
- **Gravity.** Gravity in the Inverse pulls toward an invisible, horizontal plane 30 feet below the surface.
- **Light.** The tunnels and chambers of the Inverse are dark unless otherwise noted. Locals carry their own light sources as necessary.

#### Seeds of Chaos

The residents of the Inverse are largely freethinkers and anarchists, with a smattering of criminals. Most fled here to avoid being prosecuted for crimes. Roll on the Inverse Incidents table for additional encounters characters might have in the Inverse.

##### Inverse Incidents

|  4  | A chaotic neutral **duodrone** carries a sign that reads "Glitch Is Nigh!" It entreats a character to prepare for the great multiversal realignment.                                            |

#### Inverse Hideout

Beltha's lair is a series of chambers at the edge of the Inverse (depicted on *map 5.1*). It takes 30 minutes to find the lair if the characters know the way. Refer to the "*Finding Beltha*" section if the characters don't know where to go.

When the characters reach the steam-pipe-lined tunnels where Beltha hides out, read the following:

>>A gridded iron balcony overlooks an unevenly shaped room full of intertwining pipes and machinery with noisy, exposed gears. Gas lamps shed flickering light across the area.
>>
>>Haphazard furnishings, battered crates, and mismatched knickknacks decorate the balcony above. A rusty iron spiral staircase on the room's far side climbs to this ramshackle lounge.
>>

Beltha (chaotic neutral **githzerai zerth**) is on the balcony above with her allies Kit and Kot (chaotic neutral **quadrones**). Below, near the spiral stairs, is the **red slaad** Kythkyr. The group is hostile to trespassers and demands they leave. The group attacks the following round. The quadrones favor using their Shortbow attacks, while Kythkyr tries to prevent intruders from climbing to the balcony.

A character who uses an action and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince Beltha to call off her gang and talk (see "*Talking with Beltha*" for details).

***Exposed Machinery.*** The area is filled with hazardous machinery that can catch creatures in its gears. A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of these machines, or that moves into that area for the first time on a turn, must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage and have the grappled condition (escape DC 15) as it becomes caught in the gears. A grappled creature can make another saving throw to escape the gears at the start of its next turn.

***Treasure.*** The crates and workbenches in the room are covered in rusted, worthless tools. On the balcony above lie knickknacks and pieces of symmetrical art worth a total of 200 gp. A character who examines the couch on the balcony and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a stash of several well-packed, precision-made lenses hidden between the cushions. These lenses are worth 750 gp total.

#### Talking with Beltha

Beltha is an agitator in the Inverse. She's irreverent and doesn't believe people are meant to live as rigidly as the Council of Order and the powers of Mechanus prescribe. She stole the logbook from Concord Terminus to remind Automata's residents that even the modrons' plans aren't perfect. She plans to sell the logbook and expects to get 1,000 gp for it. She'll sell it to the characters for 1,500 gp, or 1,000 gp if a character succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.

Beltha fights to the death to avoid being taken prisoner.

### Conclusion

If the characters return to him with the logbook and Beltha, Aristimus is outwardly reserved but inwardly delighted. So long as the logbook is recovered, he provides the characters with a pass to access the gate to Mechanus, along with a simple trinket: a precise copper pocket watch with a face that tracks 168 hours. The watch is worth 500 gpÃ¢ÂÂdouble that in lawfully aligned settlements, such as Automata. If the characters also return with Beltha, Aristimus provides the bonus he offered: 2,000 gp if Beltha is alive and 1,000 gp if not.

If the characters failed in their mission, Aristimus thanks them for their time and directs them to the line of applicants seeking gate access.

When the characters have completed their work in Automata, consult the "*Advancing in Level*" section of *chapter 4* and let the party determine their next destination.

## Chapter 6Ã¢ÂÂCurst: Invisible Bonds

The gate-town of Curst stands as an entrapping ring around the gate to the prison plane of Carceri. A sinkhole of betrayers and a haven for those who don't want to be found, Curst is a place where anyone is welcome to enterÃ¢ÂÂbut leaving is another story.

Completing an entry on Curst for the Mosaic Mimir is easy; no one stands in the characters' way. Once the characters are inside the gate-town's walls, though, they're not allowed to leave. A secret path to freedom exists, but the characters must be willing to pay the price and take the risks of accessing it.

Curst is detailed in *chapter 3* of *Sigil and the Outlands*. Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![Without help, Valder and Fellik Sands have little hope of escaping the oppressive gate-town of Curst](img/adventure/ToFW/027-02-005.valder-and-fellik.webp)

### Exploring Curst

As the characters approach Curst, read the following text:

>>The odor of rusty metal stings every breath. Ahead lies the gate-town of Curst, a dismal-looking community surrounded by an imposing wall. Hulking sentries mind the barrier and oversee an open gate into town. As you near the gate-town, your mimir chimes, and its eye sockets flicker like a dying candle flame.
>>

Two **maelephants** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) allow the characters to enter the gate-town. As they enter, characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher notice that the community's gates have bars only on the outsideÃ¢ÂÂas if they're designed to keep people inside. Those who question the guards here are told to move along (see the "*Curst's Walls*" section for details).

Inside, the characters find Curst's townsfolk to be a sour, suspicious lot who are generally uninterested in conversation. Getting terse directions to the gate to Carceri or any of the Curst locations requires a successful DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.

*"We're the refuse of the Outlands, the debris of shattered dreams, the waste of every failed vengeance. We're the scum of the multiverse... but we're still better than you."*Ã¢ÂÂ Tovus Gilaf, former burgomaster of Curst, to his replacement, Villigus Bazengar
#### Encounters in Curst

While exploring Curst, the characters might have any of the encounters listed on the Curst Encounters table.

##### Curst Encounters

| 4Ã¢ÂÂ6 | Eyes peer at the characters from the shadows. Roll a die. If you roll an even number, the watcher is a **spy** who's suspicious of the characters. If you roll an odd number, it's a **cranium rat squeaker swarm** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*).                                      |

### Gate to Carceri

In the center of Curst stands a rusty metal arch filled with swirling crimson sands and echoing with anguished wails. This is the gate to Carceri, also known as the Shackled Gate. No guards or deterrents block access to the gate. The gate is a two-way portal to Carceri, but most locals believe it's a one-way gate and refuse to approach. Characters loitering near the gate with the Mosaic Mimir might draw odd looks, but no challenges.

#### Curst's Walls

A 30-foot-tall wall of rusted metal and razorvine surrounds Curst. It's patrolled by a ruthless cadre of guards called the Wall Watch. These guards are under orders from the town's leader, Baron Villigus Bazengar, to prevent anyone from leaving. Two neutral evil **veterans** and a **maelephant** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) guard Curst's gates. If attacked, these guards call on additional **maelephants**, which arrive in 2 rounds. The Watch also uses a flight of four trained **wyverns** to prevent flying creatures from escaping. If the characters attack and are defeated by Curst's guards, the characters' bodies are thrown in the gate-town's dump.

#### Leaving Curst

The Wall Watch prevents characters from leaving Curst, using either threats or outright force. Characters who ask how to gain permission to leave the gate-town are dismissively referred to the burgomaster's estate to get permission from the burgomaster. Baron Villigus isn't currently in the gate-town, though, so even attempting to get his permission to leave is impossible. The **farastu demodands** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) who serve as the baron's guards stiffly relate this to anyone who appears at the estate before urging them to move on.

Once the challenges of leaving Curst become clear but before the characters make any elaborate escape attempts, proceed with the "Innocent Prisoner" section.

### Innocent Prisoner

Valder (neutral, human **Mercykiller bloodhound**; see *Morte's Planar Parade*) is an ex-Mercykiller in hiding from his former faction. Decades ago, he disobeyed the Mercykillers by refusing to bring in a bounty he believed was innocentÃ¢ÂÂa deed that led to other faction members' deaths. Valder abandoned his family when he fled his home in Sigil and went into hiding. Recently, Valder's son Fellik tracked his father down. The reunion healed old wounds for the pair but was bittersweet, as Fellik (lawful good, human **commoner**) died several years ago and is now a *petitioner* (detailed in *Morte's Planar Parade*). Now, Valder wants to help Fellik escape Curst and move on to his rightful afterlife.

#### Meeting Valder

Valder approaches the characters as they prepare to escape Curst. Read or paraphrase the following text:

>>An aged human wearing a tattered cloak approaches. His skin is crisscrossed with scars, and he carries himself with confidence. In a deep voice, the man rumbles, "They say no one leaves Curst. Really, you just need the right friends to get out, and you all look like you're in the friend-making mood."
>>

Valder introduces himself and asks if the characters want to join him and his son for tea and a chat about the gate-town's signature wall. If the characters agree, proceed with "Meeting Fellik." If the characters are suspicious, he becomes more forthright, telling them he and his son need help and inviting them to discuss details at his home.

#### Meeting Fellik

Valder's home, a tiny shack near the town dump, is made of rusted metal plates and scavenged wood. It is simply furnished with a few chairs, a table, a kitchenette, and a bench cluttered with metal scraps and tools. A curtained-off area holds a single bed.

After Valder hurries everyone inside and bars the door, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>Once you're inside, Valder calls out in a worried voice, "Fellik?" A moment later, a young man enters the space from a curtained-off bedroom. He resembles the older man, though his skin is partially transparent.
>>
>>"Time to go already, father?" the young man asks.
>>

Fellik died in an accident in Sigil several years ago. When he manifested as a *petitioner*, he took the form he had in life. However, his body, while still corporeal, is semitransparent like a ghost. Fellik and Valder have spent several weeks reconciling, but they've agreed it's time for Fellik to move on to his rightful afterlife in Mount Celestia.

Fellik is good natured but cautious and indecisive. He's wary of the characters and won't do anything they say unless a character does it first.

#### A Father's Request

Valder gets straight to the point: he wants the characters to help his son escape Curst. He can share any of the information in the "*Innocent Prisoner*" section, as well as the following details:

- Valder knows of a tunnel in the dump that goes under Curst's walls.
- Fellik can lead the characters to the tunnel, but the way is dangerous.
- Valder wants the characters to protect Fellik on his way out of the city.
- If pressed, Valder explains that he refuses to leave Curst, as he fears the Mercykillers are still hunting for him and he doesn't want to put Fellik in danger by association.

Valder offers the characters no rewardÃ¢ÂÂtheir reward is escape from Curst. If pressed, Valder flips them 2 electrum coins, which is most of the money he has in the shack (he saves another 5 coins for Fellik).

If the characters agree to help, Valder encourages them to wait until nightfall, then return, collect Fellik, and head to the dump. He urges the characters to leave so he and Fellik can say their goodbyes. Use this time to let the characters explore or run scenes from the *Curst Encounters table*.

### Curst Escape

When the characters return to Valder's shack, Fellik is ready to go. Valder gives his son a pouch containing 5 ep, and the pair share a brief hug. Fellik then leads the characters toward the dump. The journey through town is uneventful, but characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher notice locals watching them suspiciously.

When the characters arrive at the dump, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>Mountains of junk fill countless acres of Curst's dump. Debris range from simple trash to the ruins of massive structures to the blasted remains of mighty constructs. Fellik quickly leads you through a series of trash canyons.
>>

#### Curst Escape Features

Curst's dump has the following features:

- **Garbage Heaps.** Trash heaps are 20 feet tall.
- **Garbage Tunnels.** Interior spaces are cavities in the surrounding junk with 8-foot-high ceilings.
- **Lighting.** During the day, the dump is brightly lit. At night and in interior spaces, the dump isn't illuminated. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.
- **Sludge.** Viscous runoff pools in the dump. Unless otherwise noted, this sludge is 2 feet deep and is *difficult terrain*. Creatures that try to leave a pool of sludge must succeed on a DC 8 Strength saving throw or have the restrained condition. A restrained creature can make another saving throw to escape the sludge at the start of its next turn.

#### Curst Escape Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.1.

![Map 6.1: Curst Escape](img/adventure/ToFW/028-map-2.02-curst-escape.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/029-map-2.02-curst-escape-player.webp)
#### C1. Junk Heaps

>>The paths through the junk open into a canyon of smashed statuary. The largest sculpture is a two-story-tall dragon skull made of rusted metal, which protrudes from a towering trash heap. Noxious sludge pools around the skull.
>>

Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher hear bubbling and dirge-like humming from the pool. These noises come from two **otyughs** partially submerged in the sludge. They are influenced by energies from Carceri that make them gray, dour, and envious of anyone seeking freedom. If the characters don't make themselves known as they approach, the otyughs are startled and attack. Should the characters try to communicate, the otyughs speak in Otyugh and insist to know what the characters are doing. If characters reveal they're trying to escape, or if they're unable to answer, the otyughs attack. Otherwise, the otyughs are indifferent to the characters.

***Dragon Skull.*** Fellik knows that the dragon's eye sockets hide a hidden path. It can be accessed by climbing 20 feet up the garbage heaps.

#### C2. Hidden Tunnel

>>A narrow passage winds through tons of debris before opening into a leaking, dead-end cavity. Oily sludge pools along the east edge of the chamber.
>>

There is no obvious exit from this chamber, and Fellik doesn't know where to go from here. The young man swiftly grows concerned, fearing he and his father have been betrayed.

A character who inspects the ground and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check finds footprints leading into the sludge. Creatures that enter the sludge and search for a passage find a submerged tunnel leading through the opaque slime. Although the prospect is disgusting, creatures can swim through the sludge as if it were water.

#### C3. Escape Route

>>A pool of sludge opens into a small, air-filled chamber buried in the junk heaps. A tight tunnel runs from here into darkness. Two figures in bladed armor lean against a wall, a fist-sized, glowing sphere of red light floating over them.
>>

The figures are Amod Ka and Lot Sheng, lawful neutral, human **Mercykiller bloodhounds** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). Lot's *driftglobe* lights the room. On spotting Fellik, Amod asks, "Any luck finding your pops, kid?"

Amod and Lot are indifferent to the characters, but not to Fellik. They share the following details:

- They followed Fellik to Curst, hoping to track down Valder.
- They intend to capture Fellik and force him to lead them to his father.
- They encourage the characters not to get involved, explaining Valder is a criminal who let a murderer go free, resulting in multiple Mercykiller deaths.

Fellik stammers and lies poorly to the Mercykillers, but they're convinced Valder is in the gate-town. Amod and Lot soon move to drag off Fellik. If the characters impede or attack the pair, the Mercykillers attack. The Mercykillers fight to the death.

A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check convinces the Mercykillers that Valder is dead or not in Curst.

***Tunnel.*** The tunnel to the north winds for nearly a mile before ending in an arch in the wall. This a portal to a stand of trees 3 miles outside Curst. The portal's key is an electrum coin.

### Conclusion

The chapter concludes when the characters escape Curst. Once they do, consult the "*Advancing in Level*" section of *chapter 4* and let the party determine their next destination.

If Fellik is with the characters, he tells them he plans to head to Excelsior. If the characters offer to escort him, he welcomes the help but can't reward them. On reaching the gate-town, Fellik thanks the characters before departing to Mount Celestia.

## Chapter 7Ã¢ÂÂExcelsior: Lost Souls

Excelsior, the gate-town to the heavenly plane of Mount Celestia, welcomes any who are willing to embrace the lofty ideals of good and law. Good-hearted characters can easily reach the town's gate and update the Mosaic Mimir. In the process of doing so, they discover that while Excelsior strives to be an idyllic paradise, the gate-town has its problems.

Excelsior is detailed in *chapter 3* of *Sigil and the Outlands*. Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![A mysterious criminal uses sinister magic to capture souls in Excelsior](img/adventure/ToFW/030-02-006.sinister-magic.webp)

### Exploring Excelsior

As the characters approach Excelsior, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>Floating gardens and palaces orbit the towering structures of Excelsior. From amid the tallest buildings rises a tower of alabaster and gleaming, colored glass that reaches into the clouds. As you near the tower, your mimir rings like a bell, and its eyes pulse with golden light.
>>

Celestial and Humanoid townsfolk go about their business in peaceful harmony, moving between lush gardens and crisply clean shops and homes. Shortly after the characters arrive, a smiling **lantern archon** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) approaches, welcomes the characters to Excelsior, and politely offers them directions to destinations in town.

*"Excelsior isn't just a home; it's a way of life. We strive to live Excelsior every day. It's not always easy, but it's worth it to show the planes how little acts of good matter and can add up to something great."*Ã¢ÂÂ Bibiana Tama, Excelsior florist
#### The Godstrand

The gate to Mount Celestia stands atop the Godstrand, a soaring pillar whose top is perpetually hidden by clouds. Spiraling stairs ascend the tower. These are open to any who wish to climb, but those with corrupt intentions find the journey harrowing.

#### Climbing the Godstrand

Nearly a mile of stairs and ramps leads from the base of the Godstrand to its top. The stairs take most creatures approximately 18 minutes to climb.

Creatures of evil alignment see visions of judgment and shame in the mosaics that decorate the ascent. Every minute that an evil creature climbs the Godstrand or is otherwise within 100 feet of the gate to Mount Celestia, it must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has visions of its past wicked deeds and gains 1 level of exhaustion that can't be removed until it finishes a long rest away from the Godstrand. Creatures that reach level 5 exhaustion are eventually found by heavenly denizens and removed from the tower. This effect never causes a creature to have level 6 exhaustion.

#### Gate to Mount Celestia

When the characters reach the gate to Mount Celestia, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>A fragrant breeze wafts across the platform atop the Godstrand. Several benches and bare pedestals surround a final flight of seven golden stairs. Atop these stairs, an archway of endlessly interweaving golden strands forms the gate to Mount Celestia. Two towering, bear-headed sentinels in heavy armor guard the gate. Other locals linger nearby, meditating on the gate.
>>

The gate's guards are **warden archons** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). They question the intentions of anyone who nears the gate, but they allow the characters to ascend and use the Mosaic Mimir.

#### Uncertain Investigations

After the characters update their *mimir*, they're approached by a **hound archon** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). He's one of the locals who's been reflecting on the gate, and he introduces himself as Varrel, a member of the town guard. He asks if the characters are adventurers who'd be interested in helping him with a task. If the characters agree to hear him out, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>The canine-headed archon lowers his voice and says, "I'm in an unusual predicament. Locals have been disappearing from Excelsior for weeks. My investigations led me to a tiefling named Sincerity, who has been seen near many of the places where people went missing. Recently I saw her enter a garden, and an individual there vanished soon after. Sincerity is being questioned at our headquarters now, but unless the interviewers turn up something, we have no proof to hold her. I have my suspicions, but I won't accuse someone who could be innocent based on my own possibly flawed perspective.
>>
>>"That's where you come in. You're not from Excelsior. I'd love to get visitors' insights on the situation and see if they reveal anything new. What do you say?"
>>

Varrel is willing to pay the characters for their aid, offering the group 2,500 gp and a *brooch of shielding* sculpted with watchful canine features. If the characters agree to aid Varrel, he shares what he knows and can lead the characters to either the headquarters of the Excelsior Guard or *Sincerity's home* (detailed later in this chapter).

#### Law and Archons

As a hound archon, Varrel is a being of absolute law and goodness. Even if the characters are helping him, he won't condone crimes. If he sees a character commit a crime or finds out about it, he fines them 100 gp. If they discover evidence while committing a crime, he disregards it and informs the characters that he won't let it be used against Sincerity.

If the characters repeatedly commit crimes, Varrel pays them as promised, then escorts them out of Excelsior.

### Viper in the Garden

The following sections detail the cause of the disappearances in Excelsior, what information Varrel already has, and other details the characters might gain in their investigations. The characters might discover these details in any order, but the information should ultimately point toward Uncle Longteeth. If the characters reach a dead end, use Varrel to offer them a hint.

#### The Soul Trade

No one in Excelsior is sure of it yet, but Sincerity is behind the disappearances in town. She uses empty *iron flasks* provided by the night hag Uncle Longteeth to capture victims, then uses her trained sunflies to deliver the flasks to him. The night hag plans to take the souls to Hades, where he'll transform them into **larvae** (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) and sell them as delicacies to deplorable immortals. The characters gradually discover this in the course of their investigation.

#### Missing Saints

Five lifelong residents of Excelsior have gone missing. Varrel and others can share the details from the Missing Excelsior Residents table.

##### Missing Excelsior Residents
| Name     | Type       | Last Seen at...             |
|----------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Adorae   | Dragonborn | Her home                    |
| Changle  | Gnome      | An alley near the Godstrand |
| Irruwabi | Human      | The Temple of the Sunweaver |
| Wobeke   | Human      | His home                    |
| Yoi      | Tiefling   | The Forum                   |

None of the missing individuals had known rivals or left behind evidence. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check notes that none of these individuals is a native of the Outer Planes (a fact that matters for *iron flasks*).

#### Speaking with Sincerity

The headquarters of the Excelsior guard is a palatial tower filled with simple but comfortable offices, libraries, and meeting rooms. Varrel can escort the characters to the meeting room where Sincerity is being questioned. Read or paraphrase the following description when the characters arrive:

>>In this clean but stark and undecorated room converse two figures in comfortable chairs. One is a hound archon with long, straight hair, and the other is a venerable tiefling with gray braids and tiny horns, who smiles and nods as you enter.
>>

The **hound archon** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) is Rolm, an investigator who has features like a terrier. The tiefling is Sincerity, a lawful evil **assassin** (without weapons at the moment). Sincerity benefits from a supernatural gift that permanently grants her the effects of the spell *glibness*.

Varrel and Rolm let the characters question Sincerity. The tiefling is patient and polite and assures them this is a misunderstanding. She can share the following information:

- Her name is Sincerity, and she's lived in Excelsior for over thirty years. Before that, she lived in Sigil.
- She doesn't work, but she occasionally volunteers to play instruments for local youth theaters.
- She doesn't know any of the people who have gone missing, but she hopes they're found safe soon.
- She has nothing to do with any disappearances.

Sincerity answers the characters' other questions along similar lines. If the characters ask her any of the following questions, she responds as noted:

**Why are so many sunflies at your house?** Sincerity says they're her petsÃ¢ÂÂshe likes their colors.

**Why do your sunflies fly to Uncle Longteeth's wagon**? Sincerity claims not to know. Maybe he's trying to steal away her babies?

**Who is Uncle Longteeth**? She claims not to know.

Varrel and Rolm don't allow the characters to harm Sincerity or use magic on her. Even if the characters detect and note Sincerity's evil alignment, the archons dismiss this as invasive, inconclusive, and inadmissible in Excelsior's courts.

#### Sincerity's Home

If the characters ask to go to Sincerity's home, Varrel directs them to a tower of comfortable apartments. He won't go with them, as a lantern archon calls him away for some official errand.

The characters can decide what they want to do once they know where Sincerity lives. Her home has the following elements:

- **Front Door.** The door to Sincerity's home is locked, but it can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.
- **Cozy Interior.** Inside, the characters find a cozy but simple living space, kitchen, and bedroom. Sincerity's home holds no evidence of anything sinister and nothing worth more than 5 sp.
- **Terrace.** This terrace of blooming lilacs is accessible from Sincerity's home or by creatures that can reach its 150-foot height. A large cage there holds eight **sunflies** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). The sunflies glow in rainbow hues. The door to their cage is closed by a simple hook.

If a character opens the sunfly cage, a sunfly hops forward and raises its foremost limbs, as if it wants a tiny hug. If a character places any Tiny object in a sunfly's grip, the creature takes the object and begins flying spireward out of Excelsior. It ultimately lands at Uncle Longteeth's wagon, drops whatever it was holding, and then flies back to the cage.

#### Questioning Locals

The characters might question Excelsior locals, witnesses Varrel knows were near a disappearance, or Sincerity's neighbors. If so, relevant locals might share the following information:

- Sincerity seems like a nice person, but she keeps to herself.
- The local saw Sincerity walking near where someone went missing, but they didn't see her do anything wrong.
- Sincerity keeps sunflies. They're unusual in town, but they're harmless, pleasant creatures. The local sees them buzz around sometimes. (If pressed about the sunflies' travels, the local recalls they've seen the sunflies follow a regular path spireward.)
- A character who mentions strange lights or succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check causes the local to recall that they saw colorful lights near where a missing person vanished.

### Uncle Longteeth's Wagon

If the characters head a mile spireward out of town or follow Sincerity's sunflies, they find Uncle Longteeth's wagon. Read or paraphrase the following when they arrive:

>>An enclosed wagon sits in a soggy dell outside Excelsior. It appears to be made more of mold and moss than timbers. Instead of wheels, the wagon rests atop what appears to be six giant, rolled-up pill bugs. A rickety door stands at its rear.
>>

This wagon is the home of Uncle Longteeth, a **night hag** that trades in artisanal larvae across the Lower Planes. Uncle Longteeth is waiting for another delivery from Sincerity and rudely tells visitors to go away. He attacks if his wagon is broken into or if he's presented with evidence that he's involved with Sincerity's crimesÃ¢ÂÂsuch as the fact that her sunfly pets are trained to come to him. The night hag flees using *plane shift* if reduced to 30 or fewer hit points.

Uncle Longteeth's wagon is filled with empty, filthy cages. It also holds a locked chest, which a character can pick by succeeding on a DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Inside the chest are six bottles that function similarly to *iron flasks*, but they work only in the Outlands. Trapping a creature or releasing a creature in any of these flasks is possible only on this plane.

One of the flasks is empty, but the other five hold the individuals detailed in the "*Missing Saints*" section. If any of these individuals are freed, they confirm it was Sincerity who imprisoned them.

#### Decisive Evidence

Sincerity drops her act and confesses to her crimes in the following circumstances:

- **Freed Captives.** The missing individuals are freed and identify her as having imprisoned them.
- **Captive Accomplice.** Uncle Longteeth is captured and handed over to Excelsior's guards.
- **Compelling Story.** A character presents multiple compelling circumstancesÃ¢ÂÂlike locals noticing colored lights that could belong to Sincerity's sunflies and her sunflies flying to Uncle Longteeth's wagonÃ¢ÂÂand succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

Sincerity pleasantly surrenders after confessing her crimes. The guards collect Uncle Longteeth's *iron flasks* as evidence. If the characters refuse to surrender the flasks, Varrel explains he needs the bottles to ensure Sincerity meets justice at her trial. He'll look the other way if the characters take one *iron flask*, but if they try to take more, he calls upon five other **hound archons** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) who insist the characters relinquish the evidence.

### Conclusion

The chapter concludes when Sincerity confesses to her crimes or the characters' investigation reaches a dead end. In either case, Varrel thanks the characters for their efforts and rewards them as agreed. Even if Varrel didn't get new evidence to use against Sincerity, he plans to keep working the case and see the missing locals saved in accordance with the law.

If the characters got Sincerity to confess, the hound archon Rolm seeks them out before they leave Excelsior. She thanks them on behalf of the gate-town and gifts them a *lantern of revealing*.

If Uncle Longteeth escaped, he resents the characters for interfering with his business. Sometime later, he has a **smoke mephit** deliver them a threat: a **larva** (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) that bears a shocking resemblance to one of the characters.

After the characters complete their investigation, consult the "*Advancing in Level*" section of *chapter 4* and let the characters determine their next destination.

*"The day I think it's us versus the people we serveÃ¢ÂÂthe day I stop thinking we're all the sameÃ¢ÂÂis the day I can never call myself an archon again."*Ã¢ÂÂ Rolm, Excelsior investigator
## Chapter 8Ã¢ÂÂFaunel: Vicious Alliances

The gate-town of Faunel is undergoing a rebirth after the previous incarnation of the town merged with the Beastlands, leaving behind only its buildings. Amid the overgrown ruins of the previous community, factions of sapient animals vie to control the town's future. When bloodthirsty gnoll hunters arrive in the area, the town's peace becomes even more tenuous.

Faunel is detailed in *chapter 3* of *Sigil and the Outlands*. Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![The leaders of Faunel's three packs of sapient animals argue over how best to lead the gate-town](img/adventure/ToFW/031-02-008.leaders-of-faunel.webp)

### Exploring Faunel

*"Faunel's one of the wildest places in the OutlandsÃ¢ÂÂmost of the locals here are talking animals! But don't let yourself go primal. The last time things got too wild, the whole gate-town tipped right into the Beastlands!"*Ã¢ÂÂ Zendri Cork, halfling herbalist at Camp GreenbriarAs the characters approach Faunel, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>The calls of wildlife echo through a region where varied types of wildernesses meet. Forests, savannas, rocky deserts, mangrove swamps, tundras, and more form a wild patchwork. A faint ribbon of smoke leads to a collection of temporary structures that form a modest trading camp amid a sparse woodland. As you draw closer, the eyes of your mimir glow green.
>>

The region ahead is Faunel. The gate-town is a collection of sites scattered across the region the former community used to occupy. Faunel's citizens are predominantly sapient animals. At Camp Greenbriar, these animals and a small population of Humanoids meet amid simple structures within a wooden palisade, where traders barter for the basics of survival. The entrance to the camp is unguarded.

Soon after the characters enter Camp Greenbriar, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>"Hello, travelers!" calls an energetic giant sloth wearing a bracelet of claws and feathers. The creature dangles from a nearby tree and waves a three-clawed paw. "Fresh faces are always welcome in Camp Greenbriar!"
>>

The sloth is named Razak. He uses **black bear** stat block, with the following adjustments:

- Razak is neutral good.
- He has a climbing speed of 10 feet.
- He has an Intelligence of 10 and a Charisma of 14.
- He speaks Common.
- His bracelet functions as a *ring of animal influence*.

Razak is gregarious and has a groan-worthy sense of humor. He welcome the characters and offers to answer any questions they have about the town or guide them to particular points of interest. He doesn't owe his allegiance to any of the three animal groups that hold power in Faunel (see the "*The Three Packs*" section later in this chapter) and instead works as a messenger between them.

#### Gate to the Beastlands

Nearly a mile from Camp Greenbriar stands the gate to the Beastlands: a peaceful pond surrounded by vine-covered ruins. A 20-foot-tall statue of a human with glowing eyes kneels by the pool. This is the guardian of the gate, an ancient being known as Wrath. It uses the **empyrean** stat block, with the following changes:

- Its creature type is Construct (Titan).
- Its Maul attack is a Slam instead.
- It automatically knows when it hears a lie.

Wrath questions any creature approaching the pool, asking the creature's business in a booming voice. The guardian attacks any non-Beast who lies, refuses to answer, or tries to use the gate without Wrath's permission. If the characters are honest about why they want to use the gate, Wrath allows them to bring their *mimir* close to the gate and record an entry for Faunel.

### Ravenous

While the characters are exploring the area around Faunel or headed back from the portal to the Beastlands, they happen on the following scene:

>>From ahead comes the sounds of voracious snapping punctuated by frantic, laugh-like vocalizations. The source is a band of gnolls messily consuming the recently slain carcass of a giant ibex.
>>

These six hunters (use the **gnoll pack lord** stat blocks) are members of the Vile Hunt, a group of poachers murdering animals around Faunel. On noticing the characters, the gnolls attack. If four or more gnolls are killed, the survivors flee.

If Razak is with the characters, he avoids battle.

#### After the Battle

If Razak is with the characters after the battle, he identifies the ibex as Oka, a storyteller and advisor to **Ophelia**, leader of a group of local herbivores. If Razak wasn't with the characters, he comes across the scene as the battle ends and shares the same information. The ibex's body bears a distinguishing accessory: a beaded necklace with an eye-shaped topaz. The necklace is worth 40 gp.

Razak encourages the characters to come with him to Heart Delta to meet **Ophelia** and convey the news of Oka's death.

#### The Vile Hunt

Razak or others at Camp Greenbriar can identify the gnolls as members of the Vile Hunt. This group of local criminals hunt and kill for sport, targeting unawakened animals and Faunel's sapient residents indiscriminately. They're led by a cruel hunt master called Mick Mangehide. So far, the Vile Hunt has evaded locals' attempts to capture its members or drive them off.

### The Three Packs

Three factions of awakened animals seek to control Faunel. These factions are roughly divided into predators, flying creatures, and herbivores. Razak or the locals at Camp Greenbriar can direct the characters to the nearby wildernesses where these groups dwell.

#### Heart Delta

Heart Delta lies a few miles away from Camp Greenbriar. When the characters visit there, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>Sleepy rivers wind through a sprawling expanse of high grasses and fruiting trees. Giant herbivores, such as long-necked giraffes and brachiosaurs, munch on tall vegetation, while herds of bison, gazelle, and goats wander the surrounding plains. In the distance, rock formations encircle a broad crater.
>>

The crater at the center of Heart Delta is called the Hollow. Here the elephant **Ophelia** addresses hundreds of gathered animals nightly. Characters seeking **Ophelia** find her here.

**Ophelia** uses the **elephant** stat block, with the following changes:

- **Ophelia** is lawful good.
- She has an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14.
- She speaks Common.

#### Talking with Ophelia

**Ophelia** is wise and patient, and she seeks to protect her people. She wants to create a new Faunel where sapient animals overcome their instincts and live communally. If the characters converse with her, she shares the following information:

- She's saddened to hear about Oka's death but thanks the characters for informing her.
- She suspects the Vile Hunt is working for **Ebonclaw**, the leader of the predators at Razortooth Rock.
- She recently defeated **Ebonclaw** in battle when he and some of his predators attacked a herd under her protection.
- She suspects Oka's death is **Ebonclaw**'s retaliation.
- She asks the characters to go to Razortooth Rock and find out if **Ebonclaw** is working with the Vile Hunt.

If the characters can find out who is behind Oka's death, **Ophelia** promises to reward them with a *figurine of wondrous power (serpentine owl)*.

#### Razortooth Rock

Razortooth Rock stands 5 miles spireward from Camp Greenbriar. Read or paraphrase the following description as the characters approach:

>>An arid land of stark rock formations and rugged cliffs stretches ahead. Amid the dust, brush, and murky streams doze groups of wolves, tigers, hyenas, crocodiles, and more. A fang-shaped peak rises at the center of the wilderness, its surface etched with paths and caves.
>>

Sapient predatory animals follow the characters through this wilderness but don't bother the characters. At Razortooth Rock, the peak at the center of this rugged land, the characters find **Ebonclaw**.

**Ebonclaw** uses the **saber-toothed tiger** stat block with the following changes:

- **Ebonclaw** is lawful neutral.
- He has an Intelligence of 12 and a Charisma of 12.
- He speaks Common.

#### Talking with Ebonclaw

**Ebonclaw** is arrogant and cunning, but he is nursing his wounded pride after a clash with **Ophelia**. He seeks to create a Faunel where the residents embrace their skills, becoming proud and powerful.

**Ebonclaw** is suspicious of visitors, even if Razak is with them. He converses only if a character succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check or brings him a gift of fresh yak meat. Characters might purchase yak meat at Camp Greenbriar for 20 gp or ask **Ophelia** to provide it from a non-sapient source.

Once **Ebonclaw** agrees to speak with the characters, he is forthright and shares the following:

- He was recently defeated in battle by **Ophelia**. He and his hunters attacked a group of reindeer, not realizing the group was under her protection. His group was in the wrong.
- He knows nothing of Oka's death but is sad to hear of it. He doubts any creature in his territory was involved.
- **Ebonclaw** loathes the Vile Hunt.
- Although he doesn't know who killed Oka, he suggests asking **Parvaz** at Eagles' AerieÃ¢ÂÂthe albatross leader's flying followers see all.

#### Eagles' Aerie

A forest of exceptionally tall trees lies a few hours away from Camp Greenbriar. If the characters visit the forest, read the following description:

>>Straight, high-branched trees create a lofty canopy. Broad nests and tree houses hide among the branches. Below, small forest creatures scamper across shadowed trails.
>>

Any of the sapient birds who make their home in Eagles' Aerie can direct the characters to their leader, **Parvaz**. Currently, the albatross is at a meeting place called Watcher's Talon, deep in the forest. The most direct route to the site takes 2 hours. Unless a character succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check, they follow a winding route that takes twice as long.

On reaching Watcher's Talon, the characters find a petrified, leafless tree. Here the giant albatross **Parvaz** holds court with a congress of winged creaturesÃ¢ÂÂsapient **eagles**, **owls**, **pteranodons**, winged lizards, and more.

**Parvaz** uses the **giant eagle** stat block, with the following changes:

- **Parvaz** is neutral.
- He has an Intelligence of 16 and a Charisma of 14.
- He speaks Common.

#### Talking with Parvaz

**Parvaz** is guarded and pragmatic. He seeks to create a Faunel on par with other gate-towns, where the residents trade and leverage their unique abilities.

During a conversation with the characters, **Parvaz** shares the following information:

- He knows nothing of Oka's death and doesn't particularly care.
- The Vile Hunt rarely bothers his followers.
- He knows where the Vile Hunt lairs, but he doesn't know why he should share that information.

A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince **Parvaz** to share the location of the Vile Hunt's camp. Otherwise, the characters need to make sharing this information worth **Parvaz**'s while. **Parvaz** would be interested in the *figurine of wondrous power (serpentine owl)* **Ophelia** offered the characters. He's also willing to accept a gift at a later date, at which point he sends agents to see if the characters have anything he'd be interested in.

Once the characters have struck a deal with **Parvaz**, he shares the location of the Vile Hunt.

#### Pursuing the Vile Hunt

The Vile Hunt gnolls lurk in a clearing a half-day's travel from Camp Greenbriar. If the characters bring this information to **Ebonclaw** or **Ophelia**, the first leader they speak to offers the characters 2,000 gp worth of gemstones to participate in a raid. They also send friendly animals equal to the number of characters. **Ebonclaw** sends **dire wolves**, and **Ophelia** sends **rhinoceroses**.

![Map 8.1: Vile Hunt Camp](img/adventure/ToFW/032-map-2.03-vile-hunt-camp.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/033-map-2.03-vile-hunt-camp-player.webp)
#### Vile Hunt Camp

The Vile Hunt's camp is depicted on map 8.1. Read the following when the characters reach the camp:

>>The smell of charred meat fills a disorderly camp hidden between tangled woodlands and a rugged cliff. Bedrolls, cages, and drying racks with stretched animal skins cluster around smoldering bonfires. At the camp's rear, a filthy tarp covers a large cage.
>>

Mick Mangehide, the **gnoll fang of Yeenoghu** who leads the Vile Hunt, camps here with four hunters (use the **gnoll pack lord** stat block). They attack as soon as they see any outsiders, and they fight to the death. One hunter stays near the cage at the rear of the camp. After 1 round, the hunter opens the cage and releases the panicked **triceratops** inside.

***Triceratops.*** The triceratops uses its Trampling Charge trait as often as it can, attacking a random creature every round. A character who spends an action and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can direct the dinosaur to flee from the camp toward the south.

***Treasure.*** Among the filthy gear is a sack containing three *potions of healing* and 1,400 gp. The cages are empty except for one holding a lengthy snakeskin that functions as a *rope of entanglement*.

### Conclusion

The chapter concludes when the characters leave Faunel or when they have defeated the Vile Hunt. If the characters return to any of the leaders of the animal groups, the leaders commend the characters' actions and provide them any promised rewards. Razak also thanks the characters for their help and gifts them his *ring of animal influence*.

Once the chapter concludes, consult the "*Advancing in Level*" section of *chapter 4* and let the characters determine their next destination.

## Chapter 9Ã¢ÂÂGlorium: Heroes of the Day

he gate-town of Glorium rings with songs of glory. In the bay beyond the town swirls a great whirlpool that regularly swallows and disgorges ships. This is the gate to Ysgard, where the characters must bring the Mosaic Mimir.

Glorium is detailed in *chapter 3* of *Sigil and the Outlands*. Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![Whirlwyrms attack the living ship, Courier, in the whirlpool-portal to Ysgard](img/adventure/ToFW/034-02-009.courier.webp)

### Exploring Glorium

When the character near Glorium, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>Songs and shouts rise over a sturdy-looking town between snowy mountains at the mouth of a bay churning with rough waters. In the surrounding fields, warriors and martial artists hone their skills. As you near, your mimir chimes as its eyes brim with a swirling, blue-green light.
>>

The people of Glorium are a hearty lot. Locals can offer directions anywhere the characters want to go, but some might make a good-natured demand for a contest first (see the following section). If the characters ask about the gate to Ysgard, residents point them to the docks (see the "*Gate to Ysgard*" section).

#### Contests

The people of Glorium delight in good-natured competitions. Treat these competitions as a series of three ability checks. If a character succeeds on two or more of the three ability checks, they win. If a character fails on two or more ability checks, their opponent wins. The Glorium Contests table lists several competitions along with a suggested DC and ability check to use in competitions against Glorium's residents, which you can use as inspiration for contests of your own.

##### Glorium Contests
|  d4 | Contest       |  DC | Ability Check                          |
|:---:|---------------|:---:|----------------------------------------|
|  1  | Arm wrestling |  17 | Strength (Athletics)                   |
|  2  | Pinfinger     |  15 | Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)            |
|  3  | Goat milking  |  14 | Wisdom (Animal Handling)               |
|  4  | Flyting       |  13 | Charisma (Intimidation or Performance) |

#### Gate to Ysgard

The gate to Ysgard is a maelstrom a mile offshore. Characters directed to the gate can see it in the distance from Glorium's docks. Spells like *fly* or *water walk* can help characters reach the gate, but getting close enough to update their *mimir* is a damp, miserable experience that attracts the attention of whirlwyrms (see the "*Whirlwyrm Attack*" section).

Hiring a boat to sail to the portal is less treacherous. If the characters ask locals about hiring a boat or wander the docks, they'll meet Bkol Steelbane, captain of the *Courier*.

#### Courier

Bkol Steelbane (chaotic good, orc **veteran**) is a lanky sailor and one of two captains of the *Courier*. The other captain is the *Courier* itself, as the vessel is an amalgam of longship and joke-loving, sapient giant raven. The pair has been ferrying folks through the portal to Ysgard for years.

#### Passage to the Maelstrom

Bkol and the *Courier* have recently returned from Ysgard and are willing to sail to the portal. Bkol charges 100 gp for the ride, but he allows the characters free passage if one of them beats him in a sea-urchin-eating contest. This contest (see the "*Contests*" section) requires a participating character to succeed on at least two DC 17 Constitution ability checks. Even if a character loses, they earn Bkol's respect, and he reduces his price to 50 gp.

Once Bkol and the *Courier* are hired, they and their crew of eight rowers (chaotic good **guards**) are ready to leave at the characters' convenience.

### Whirlwyrm Attack

Reaching the gate to Ysgard by boat takes an hour. As the characters near the maelstrom, a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices two serpentine shapes in the water. These are deadly giant eels known as whirlwyrms (use the **giant crocodile** stat block). If no character notices the whirlwyrms, the characters and all the sailors on the *Courier* are surprised when the eels burst from the waterÃ¢ÂÂone on each side of the shipÃ¢ÂÂand attack. A **whirlwyrm** dives underwater and flees if it is reduced to 10 or fewer hit points.

If the characters didn't journey to the whirlpool using the *Courier*, the whirlwyrms still attack, rising 10 feet out of the water to snap at the characters.

#### Battle on the Courier

*Map 9.1* depicts the *Courier*. The bird-boat has the following features:

- **Crew.** Bkol and the ship's rowers stay out of battle, trying to keep the ship on course.
- **Movement.** The Courier moves 40 feet away from any creature in the water each round. The whirlwyrms use all but 10 feet of their movement to keep pace with the ship.
- **Wing Sails.** The Courier's wings are *difficult terrain*. Any creature on a wing that takes 10 or more damage must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the water.

Once the whirlwyrms are defeated, a character can update the Mosaic Mimir with a report on Glorium.

### Saga of the Whirlwyrm

Whether aboard the *Courier* or back on shore, the unusual nature of a **whirlwyrm** attack becomes clear. If the characters haven't met Bkol, he witnessed their encounter with the whirlwyrms and approaches. The captain is shocked to see whirlwyrms, as they typically hunt near Grakenok, a bariaur community across the bay. If the whirlwyrms are moving into the bay, Bkol suspects that something has happened to the bariaurs.

Bkol shares his concern with the characters and asks them to come with him to meet Tyrza Bonebreaker, Glorium's leader.

#### Hero among Heroes

Read the following when the characters find Tyrza:

>>You come across Tyrza Bonebreaker shot-putting a laughing halfling into the air. The halfling fellow soars over twenty feet, nearly overshooting bales of wool in the town circle. A cheer rises from the motley crowd surrounding Tyrza, who shrugs and laughs.
>>
>>The leader of Glorium strands well over six feet tall, with an artistically etched prosthetic arm and an impressive collection of tattoos covering her copper-colored skin. She notices Bkol as he approaches and gives a friendly shout: "Bkol! Back from the land of legends! Glad to see we keep you coming back!"
>>

Tyrza Bonebreaker (chaotic good, human **gladiator**; *detailed further* in *Sigil and the Outlands*) is loud, powerful, and free with her feelings and praise. She's fond of Bkol, and listens as he encourages the characters to recount the **whirlwyrm** attack. When he's done reporting, Tyrza says the following:

>>"Whirlwyrms! Lost villagers! Certain peril! Hear that, Glorium?" Tyrza booms. "It sounds like we're in need of heroes!"
>>
>>Around her, the people of Glorium go wild with cheers and the shouts of volunteers. Tyrza points dramatically at two heroic-looking locals, then turns to Bkol. "And what about you and your crew here, Bkol? You up to saving someone's world?"
>>

Bkol leaves the choice up to the characters. If asked what's going on, Bkol explains that Glorium is a town full of glory seekers and that Tyrza rewards those who serve the gate-town. Bkol assures the characters it's worth their while if they offer aid.

If the characters agree to go to Grakenok and find out what's happening, Bkol ferries them free of charge. Tyrza bids them a glorious adventure.

#### The Competition

The characters aren't the only heroes headed to Grakenok. These two rivals also step up and seek to find out what's happened at Grakenok:

- **Sytri.** A silent, masked woman wearing Doomguard armor, Sytri is a chaotic good **Doomguard rot blade** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). She unfurls a *carpet of flying* measuring 3 feet by 5 feet and woven with the image of a flying demon skull.
- **Tol Frostmane.** Full of flattery and bravo, Tol is a towering **equinal guardinal** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) with a neatly braided black mane and a loose poet's shirt. He sails a swift sailboat called the Allure.

Both heroes are respectful toward the characters but defend themselves if attacked.

#### Off to Adventure

Sytri and Tol want to be the first to find out what's happening in Grakenok, and Bkol encourages the characters to act swiftly to keep up with them. Sytri and Tol set off immediately, using their *carpet of flying* and ship, respectively. The characters can travel to Grakenok however they like. It would take their walking castle days to circle the bay and reach Grakenok, so Bkol offers them use of the *Courier*.

As with all places in the Outlands, the distance between Glorium and Grakenok varies. How long the journey takes is up to you, but so long as the characters don't pause for any amount of time longer than a short rest, they arrive in Grakenok at about the same time as their rivals. The events in the "Perils at Sea" section might also delay the characters or their rivals.

### Perils at Sea

Use the following encounters to add peril to the characters' journey.

#### Lost Dingy

Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher see the following scene:

>>In the distance, you can see a dingy being tossed by the bay's choppy waters. The vessel seems to be taking on water, sinking into the waves. You can make out one small occupant on the craft.
>>

The sailor in the dingy is a human youngster in danger. Changing course to save the ship delays the characters' arrival in Grakenok (see the "*Arriving in Grakenok*" section).

The characters might be traveling close enough to Sytri or Tol that the other hero can hear them. A character who points out the floundering ship to the other hero and succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces their rival to investigate the boat, delaying that hero's arrival in Grakenok.

The dingy is doomed, but its lone sailor is easily saved. This precocious human **commoner** calls himself Kai and is impressed by whoever rescued him. Kai might be either a young thrill seeker from Glorium or the Lemming Boy (see the "*Glorium*" section of *Sigil and the Outlands*).

If no one tries to save the dingy, both it and its occupant eventually fade from view and don't reappear.

#### Whirlwyrm Spotted

A giant splash reveals another **whirlwyrm** (use the **giant crocodile** stat block) swimming near the characters. If sailing characters want to sneak by the creature, they must succeed on a DC 10 group Dexterity (Stealth) check, or the monster notices them and attacks. If the characters engage the creature in combat, they're delayed in arriving at Grakenok (see the "Arriving in Grakenok" section).

A character who calls out to a nearby rival and succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince the rival to fight the **whirlwyrm**, which delay's that hero's arrival in Grakenok.

### Arriving in Grakenok

Determine the order in which the characters and their rivals arrive at Grakenok. The characters, Sytri, and Tol would reach the town at the same time, but each arrives 1 round later for each time they were delayed during the "*Perils at Sea*" section. This order influences events in the following sections.

If the characters took a long rest or made a lengthy detour after Sytri and Tol left Glorium, the characters arrive in Grakenok after their rivals have already defeated the threat there. Proceed with the "*Victory at Grakenok*" section.

### Beast of Grakenok

When Grakenok comes into sight, read or paraphrase the description below. If Sytri or Tol reached Grakenok before the characters, they are already engaged in battle.

>>With its colorful homes and varied goat and sea-serpent carvings, the village of Grakenok would look cozy were it not being attacked by a behemoth **whirlwyrm**. Over thirty feet long, the giant eel towers over the town's few bariaur defenders, smashing fishing boats and cottages in its rampage.
>>

The bariaurs of Grakenok have put up a heroic defense of their home. They've been suffering **whirlwyrm** attacks for days, culminating in an assault by a massive elder **whirlwyrm**. This **giant whirlwyrm** uses the **behir** stat block with these adjustments:

- Replace its climbing speed with a swimming speed of 60 feet. It slithers swiftly on land and retains its 50-foot walking speed.
- Change its lightning breath to deal thunder damage. This represents its discombobulating roar.

The enraged **whirlwyrm** fights to the death.

![Map 9.1: Courier](img/adventure/ToFW/035-map-2.04-courier.webp)

#### Four-Way Battle

The characters, **Sytri**, and **Tol** all seek the glory of defeating the elder **whirlwyrm**. Track how much damage each character and the rival heroes deal to the monster every round. Instead of rolling damage, Sytri and Tol both deal 10 damage to the **whirlwyrm** on each of their turns. For every round by which a rival hero beats the characters to Grakenok (if any), that hero has already dealt 10 damage to the monster. If the characters beat Sytri or Tol to Grakenok, the rival heroes enter battle as soon as they arrive.

Sytri and Tol focus on the monster and ignore the characters unless the party attacks them first.

### Victory at Grakenok

When the elder **whirlwyrm** is defeated, the bariaurs of Grakenok laud the heroes who saved them. They treat whoever dealt the **whirlwyrm** the most damage as the true hero, thoughÃ¢ÂÂwhether this be one of the characters, Sytri, or Tol. To this true hero, the bariaurs present one of the **whirlwyrm**'s foot-long fangs. If a character wins, Sytri and Tol prove to be graceful competitors and congratulate the victor.

### Conclusion

On their return to Glorium, the characters are greeted by Tyrza and locals who want to know everything that happened. If a character brings back the **whirlwyrm** fang the bariaurs gave them, Tyrza recognizes that character as the Hero of the Day. She also rewards that character with a *silver horn of Valhalla* and your choice of one of the following treasures:

- A wide-brimmed *hat of disguise*
- A *+1 weapon* once wielded by Tyrza's father, Flatnose Grim
- A *cloak of protection* embroidered with patterns of bariaur travelers

Tyrza then hosts a daylong feast in the character's honor.

If no character returned with the **whirlwyrm** fang, Tyrza invites them to the feast she throws for whoever did. Bkol then thanks the characters for the adventure and rewards them with three feathers from the *Courier*. These function as three random *Quaal's feather tokens*.

Once the chapter concludes, consult the "*Advancing in Level*" section of *chapter 4* and let the party determine their next destination.

## Chapter 10Ã¢ÂÂRigus: Eternity's Rampart

The gate-town of Rigus is under siege. Brutal attacks through the portal to Acheron have pinpointed the town's weaknesses and worn its defenders down. If the characters wish to access the gate to Acheron, they'll have to help the gate-town's defenders discover how their foes strike with such uncanny precision.

Rigus is detailed in *chapter 3* of *Sigil and the Outlands*. Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![An ettin warlord emerges through the gate to Acheron, leading an invasion of Rigus](img/adventure/ToFW/036-02-010.ettin-warlord.webp)

### Approaching Rigus

As the characters approach Rigus, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>From a flat, dusty plain rises a seven-tiered hill girded by ring after ring of iron battlements. Towers and siege engines bristle across these rising walls, and even from a distance, you can make out regimented patrols of armored figures. Simple structures and homes squeeze between the town's daunting fortifications. Your mimir chimes as you draw closer, its glowing eyes pulsing in time with a distant drumbeat.
>>

If the characters draw near Rigus in their walking castle, the gate-town's defenders believe they're under attack, as detailed in the following section. Otherwise, proceed with the "*Entering Rigus*" section.

#### Attack on Rigus

*"Do as I say, and you won't have any problems."*Ã¢ÂÂ Captain Timoroth Brezd, Rigus soldierThe sight of a walking castle closing on the gate-town puts all of Rigus on alert. Blaring horns precede every gate into town closing and patrols outside the gate-town converging into a small army in the walking castle's path. Moments later, a **Harmonium captain** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) who imbibed a *potion of flying* approaches the walking castle. When the captain is close enough to be heard, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:

>>A human solider wearing rust-red plate armor flies through the air. He comes to a halt, hovering several dozen feet away from the walking castle. "I am Corporal Piang Shu, representative of the Crown Generals of Rigus," he shouts in a commanding voice. "Declare yourselves, and remove your war machine beyond sight of Rigus's highest tower. Otherwise, we will defend ourselves with full martial force!"
>>

By pleading their case and succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check, a character can convince Shu they don't intend to attack Rigus. Shu's demand to remove the walking castle is nonnegotiable, though, and the distance he insists on is a day's travel away. The Castellan can drop the characters off, then move the castle without them.

Once the misunderstanding is clarified, Shu has the town's forces stand down, escorts the characters to the entrance to Rigus, and then departs.

#### Entering Rigus

Read or paraphrase the following description as the characters near the entrance to Rigus:

>>Soldiers wearing plate armor stop those attempting to enter the gate-town. While soldiers are waved through with a few words, others undergo more rigorous questioning. Most are given some sort of badge and move on, while a few others are brusquely escorted away.
>>

Ten lawful neutral **knights** guard the entrance to Rigus. The guards ask each character a few questions:

- Have you come to join the army of Rigus or proceed on to wars in Acheron?
- What is your business in Rigus?
- Do you have any weapons of interplanar destruction to declare?

If a character answers truthfully, or lies and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check, the guards grant the character a gray badge that can be worn as a pin or medallion. A guard explains that the badge identifies the character as a visitor and must be worn at all times. Anyone found not wearing a gray badge is removed from town.

The guards are humorless. Any character who tries to avoid the guards or who makes light of their questioning is subjected to an hour of thorough but frivolous questioning before being admitted.

### The Sealed Gate

Once inside, the characters can explore Rigus. Any patrolling soldier can curtly direct the characters to the gate to Acheron. The path to the gate, which lies beneath Rigus's hill, is accessible from the highest district. Reaching the gate involves a winding walk of over a mile from the town's entrance.

On reaching the gate, the characters find it sealed by an intimidating iron gate guarded by eight lawful neutral **knights**. These guards are under orders not to admit "slates"Ã¢ÂÂslang for nonmilitary folk who wear slate-gray badges. A character who demands to see the guards' superior is directed to Major Kalar, who has a command tent nearby.

#### Meeting Major Kalar

If the characters follow the guards' directions, they arrive at a field covered in simple command tents. It takes 15 minutes to find Major Kalar's white tent amid the bustle of officers and messengers. When the characters enter the tent, read the following:

>>A stony-faced hobgoblin woman in a sharp-looking uniform looks up from a desk covered in neat stacks of papers and folded envelopes. Her brow furrows. "This isn't the welcome center, slates. March on."
>>

Major Nirra Kalar (lawful neutral, hobgoblin **gladiator**) is busy and not eager to be interrupted. If the characters explain themselves, she listens. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- The portal to Acheron is closed after a series of deadly attacks from the gate's far side.
- Assaults from Acheron are common, but these attacks have been highly effective and have caught Rigus's defenders off guard each time.
- Extra troops now defend the gate, but the attacks exploit every shift change and flawed positioning.
- Kalar fears a spy is in Rigus's midst.
- If the characters can prove they have any sort of martial aptitude, Kalar offers to hire them to seek out how the forces through the gate are getting intel on Rigus's defenses.

If the characters agree to help end the threat, the major promises them access to the gate to Acheron, 1,000 gp each, and their choice of equipment from the Rigus officer's armory (detailed in the "*Conclusion*"). Once Kalar and the characters come to an arrangement, she can escort them to the gate to Acheron when they're ready.

### Acheron Incursion

Reaching the gate to Acheron involves following a long tunnel to a massive mechanical lift. So long as the characters are with Major Kalar, the town guards don't impede them.

Read or paraphrase the following description when the characters reach the gate:

>>Within a cavernous, steel-lined bunker deep below Rigus stands the gate to Acheron, an archway of iron spikes and bone. The area around the gate looks like a battlefield and is littered with heaps of broken metal and shattered armaments. A ring of barricades circles the gate, beyond which at least two hundred Rigus soldiers maintain a rigid, watchful formation.
>>

#### Rigus Forces

Rigus's forces are largely hobgoblin and human **guards**. Two commanders oversee these troops:

- **Sergeant Gauller.** A quick-to-smile, lawful neutral **cambion**, Gauller welcomes the characters' help but has no idea why foes from Acheron are attacking so aggressively. Gauller is wary of being targeted by the enemy and has a spellcaster in his service cast *nondetection* on him every 8 hours.
- **Sergeant Luggik.** Luggik looks like an armored human woman and behaves like a veteran solider. In fact, the real Luggik was replaced by a **gray slaad** (see the following section) that wears a *ring of mind shielding*. The slaad has blended in with Rigus's forces and learned much about the gate-town's defenses.

Kalar introduces the characters to both sergeants. While the soldiers are polite, they both have duties to perform and are watchful of the gate.

#### Invaders' Methods

The invading Acheron forces serve a warlord named Thalir Heartbane, a goblin warlord favored by the god Maglubiyet. Recently, an ettin servant of Thalir with heads named Zot and Sotu came into possession of a gray slaad's control gem (see the *Monster Manual*). The gray slaad uses its Shapechanger trait to pose as Sergeant Luggik. During assaults through the portal, the slaad uses telepathy to relate information to Zot and Sotu's agents, who then slip back through the portal. This helps the invaders prepare ever-deadlier attacks.

#### Before Battle

The characters can inspect the gate to Acheron or speak to any of the soldiers at the gate. Major Kalar won't let the characters attune the Mosaic Mimir to the portal, though, insisting they fulfill their deal with her first. There's little evidence to discover, but the soldiers reinforce the direness of their situation and convey their dread of the next attack. When the characters are done investigating, proceed with the following section.

### Acheron Attacks

When the attack from Acheron comes, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>The gate to Acheron flares to life, the portal resembling a great, burning feline eye. Gigantic, conical projectilesÃ¢ÂÂeach made of rusted iron and over fifteen feet longÃ¢ÂÂblast through the gate in rapid succession, impacting amid Rigus's defenders. Soldiers scream and barricades shatter. Then a wave of berserk invaders charges through the gate.
>>

In moments, dozens of Rigus guards and berserkers from Acheron clash in battle. Three massive projectilesÃ¢ÂÂslivers of the great iron cubes that make up the plane beyondÃ¢ÂÂand their impact craters mar the battlefield.

This battlefield is keyed to map 10.1. The characters start anywhere in the southernmost 10 feet of the map. Five neutral evil human and goblin **berserkers** near the gate notice the characters and attack. Those foes fight to the death.

The characters' alliesÃ¢ÂÂlike Major Kalar, Sergeant Gauller, and the fake Sergeant LuggikÃ¢ÂÂhold their own elsewhere on the battlefield.

![Map 10.1: Gate to Acheron](img/adventure/ToFW/037-map-02.05-gate-to-acheron.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/038-map-02.05-gate-to-acheron-player.webp)
#### Gate to Acheron Battlefield Features

The battlefield around the gate to Acheron has the following features:

- **Barricades.** Any Large or smaller creature that attempts to move over one of these barricades must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it fails, the creature doesn't cross the barricade, and its speed is 0 until the end of the turn.
- **Difficult Terrain.** The heaps of debris and the impact craters surrounding the Acheron projectiles are *difficult terrain*.

| 1Ã¢ÂÂ3 | A random character sees something suspicious, such as Sergeant Luggik not striking a foe or a foe shielding her from a blow.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4Ã¢ÂÂ5 | A hostile **berserker** appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the map's edge near a random character.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6Ã¢ÂÂ9 | A stray heavy crossbow bolt targets a random character. The attack has a +4 bonus to hit and deals 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  10 | A 10-foot-wide, iron projectile blasts from the gate to Acheron along the path that affects the greatest number of characters. Creatures in the projectile's path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |

#### Midbattle Deductions

During the battle, a character can spend an action to watch for something unusual. If they do, the character makes a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check is successful, the character notices "Sergeant Luggik" stage fighting with a foe who clearly doesn't intend her harm. Unbeknownst to the character, the fake Luggik is using telepathy to relate information to this spy mid-battle.

If called out for this, the fake Luggik appears at the map's edge near a random character and stalls until the second wave of battle. If attacked or impeded, the **gray slaad** assumes its true form and tries to escape through the gate.

#### Second Wave

After the berserkers are defeated, the characters have 1 round to recover. If no character has already noticed Luggik's behavior, the character with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices Luggik's mock fighting, as noted above. At the end of this round, read the following description:

>>The portal to Acheron flares again, and three two-headed giants stride through. One wears plates of armor riddled with spikes. From one of its helmets glints a gray gemstone.
>>

Three ettins emerge through the portal. Two use the stat blocks of normal **ettins**, but the third is Zot and Sotu, who are an **ettin** with an Armor Class of 16.

Any character who observes the gray gem and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes it as a slaad control gem: a stone that gives the wearer control over a slaad. A second successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check also allows a character to realize that some slaadi can change shape.

If Zot and Sotu are reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, they call for aid. If the fake Luggik hasn't reverted to its **gray slaad** form, she does so now and appears on the battlefield as noted above.

### Conclusion

The characters might have pieced together that Luggik was replaced by a slaad spy. If they didn't, Major Kalar notices the control gem on Zot and Sotu's armor and makes suggestions until the characters have the gist of the details from the "*Invaders' Methods*" section.

Major Kalar then grants the characters access to the gate to Acheron. Afterward, she leads the characters to the officer's armory, from which each character can choose one of the following magic items:

- *+1 weapon* of any type from the *Player's Handbook*
- *+1 wand of the war mage*
- *Cloak of protection*
- *Dimensional shackles*

Kalar sees the characters paid and thanks them before heading off to file a lengthy report.

After this, consult "*Advancing in Level*" in *chapter 4* and let the party determine their next destination.

## Chapter 11Ã¢ÂÂSylvania: Titan on the Town

Sylvania, gate-town to Arborea, lies in the embrace of a mystical forest. Ephemeral lights drift along mossy streets, and whimsical architecture complements a wilderness of ageless trees, talking vegetation, and colorful toadstools. Sylvania's gate is unique among the gate-towns, as it shifts locations around the community, confounding efforts to locate it. Further complicating the characters' efforts in town, a powerful being who has reached an emotional tipping point has become a problem for the community.

Sylvania is detailed in *chapter 3* of *Sigil and the Outlands*. Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![The revels of {@creature Kopoha|ToFW} the empyrean get out of hand in the gate-town of Sylvania](img/adventure/ToFW/039-02-011.kopoha.webp)

### Exploring Sylvania

As the characters approach Sylvania, read or paraphrase the following description:

>>Merriment and music fill the air beneath a canopy of colorful foliage. Marvelous buildings encircle the trees or are built amid their spreading boughs. Passing revelers wave and offer you crowns woven of fresh, colorful flowers. As they do, your mimir chimes, and its eyes twinkle in rainbow hues.
>>

Sylvania's residents welcome the characters and can answer questions about locations in the town and the gate (see the following section).

As the characters explore the gate-town, any of the events on the Sylvania Encounters table might occur.

*"I said I'm coming! I just need to say a few words about the gate-town for this mimir fellow first. Hold on waitÃ¢ÂÂwait. Who's here? And they're doing what?! YoooooÃ¢ÂÂthat's epic level! Let's goooo!"*Ã¢ÂÂ King Ewren III of Ewrendar, a pixie kingdom in Sylvania

|  2  | A **cranium rat squeaker swarm** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) wants to help one its members that has a hangover. The swarm asks if the lone rat can sleep in a character's pack or asks if the characters know another good place for a nap.    |
|  3  | Three **musteval guardinals** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) mistake a character for a stranger who sang with their band last night. They insist the character perform in the show the guardinals are headed to.                                  |

#### Gate to Arborea

The gate to Arborea lies in the woods near Sylvania, but it changes location randomly, rarely settling in a location for more than a day. Locals can explain the gate's wandering nature, but they can't locate it. The only beings who always know the gate's location are the ephemeral rulers of Sylvania: the Seven Spiritors. Usually the spiritors are busy overseeing festivities in town, but as luck would have it, one of them has need of the characters.

### A Titanic Problem

Among the endless celebrations ongoing throughout the gate-town, the scion of a god is nursing a crushing defeat and is on the verge of making it everyone's problem. As the characters are exploring Sylvania, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>A booming, furious voice followed by a peel of thunder cuts through the din of laughter and celebration. Nearby celebrants turn from their revels to look in the voice's direction, while others relocate their festivities. One of these locals approaches youÃ¢ÂÂa satyr in an airy gown, whose eyes glow with tangerine light.
>>

This is Spiritor Danai, a spirit of revelry who is inhabiting the body of a willing host, a **satyr** named Kallista. Danai is chaotic good, friendly, and unflappably optimistic. As she approaches, each character becomes aware of the spiritor's name and her nature as a bodiless spirit and leader of the gate-town. Danai greats the characters, asks if they're enjoying themselves, and inquires about their business in town. Whether the characters ask about the yelling or she has to bring up the matter herself, she also shares the following information:

- The ruckus is coming from a despondent **empyrean**: **Kopoha**, the Celestial child of a god of storms who is trying to crash a private event.
- Empyreans are creatures of incredible power and overwhelming emotion.
- Should **Kopoha**'s dark mood grows much stronger, she might become a danger to the town.
- If the characters distract **Kopoha** from the event at the Yearning Timbers event hall, Danai will lead the characters to the gate to Arborea.
- Danai doesn't know the cause of the empyrean's foul mood, but there are celebrations aplenty in town where the characters might lighten **Kopoha**'s mood.

#### Meeting Kopoha

When the characters seek out **Kopoha**, they find her in the following scene:

>>An eighteen-foot-tall, humanlike woman with marble skin and eyes crackling with lightning crouches to agitatedly argue with a calm, silver-haired elf. Beyond the elf is a rollicking celebration taking place inside a towering banyan tree strobing with colored lights.
>>

**Kopoha** (chaotic good **empyrean** without a Maul attack) argues with an elf named Manalath (neutral good **mage**), who's respectfully preventing the empyrean from entering the Yearning Timbers. Inside is a rare, invite-only event being hosted by Rillifane Rallathil, an elf god of nature. Manalath apologizes and calmly repeats that **Kopoha** isn't on the guest list. As **Kopoha** grows more insistent, winds carrying the scent of a thunderstorm rise around the pair.

The argument continues until the characters intervene. Any interruption catches **Kopoha** off guard. She sizes up the characters and says, "I suppose you're not completely unworthy of my time. Why do you approach **Kopoha**?" Her demeanor is challenging but not hostile.

A character can talk **Kopoha** away from the Yearning Timbers through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Characters who flatter **Kopoha** have advantage on this check.

Once the characters convince **Kopoha** to leave the Yearning Timbers, they need someplace to take her; otherwise, she returns to arguing with Manalath.

#### Kopoha's Bad Day

**Kopoha** recently endured a crushing defeat by her bitterest rival, her sister Alethira. The two are always trying to outdo each other as they vie for their parents' approval. They are usually well matched, but this time Alethira humiliated **Kopoha** by beating her at cards and taking her maul as a prize. This defeat exacerbated the worries **Kopoha** harbors (see the following section). She's trying to bury her worries by recklessly celebrating in Sylvania.

#### Titanic Pain

In situations noted later in this chapter, **Kopoha** might share the following truths and a quandary about her life:

- **Familial Expectations.** **Kopoha**'s parents expect her to become a god one day. They're constantly watching her and judging whether she's good enough for godhood. That's a lot to live up to! How do the characters think she can ever live up to the expectations of literal gods?
- **Sibling Jealousy.** **Kopoha** thinks her sister, Alethira, is amazing at everything. **Kopoha** respects her sister but feels she has to prove to her parents that she's just as worthy a daughter and future god. How do the characters think she can be a loving sister while proving she's just as amazing as Alethira?
- **Divine Insecurity.** **Kopoha** dreads becoming a god. She doesn't even know herself yet. What if she becomes a god of the sea? She hates seafood! Or what if she becomes god of something embarrassing, like smelly winds? It's a big deal for an immortal! What do the characters think she should be god of?

How characters react to these confessions affects how **Kopoha**'s visit to Sylvania ends (see the "*Closing Time*" section).

### Celebrations in Sylvania

Revelry is in no short supply in Sylvania. Characters looking for celebrations or distractions in the gate-town might stumble across or be directed to the events in this section. Use the events you think the characters will enjoy, in any order.

#### Dryad Dance

In a clearing lit by energetic fireflies, a group of ten **dryads** sings and dances. The group welcomes anyone who comes in peace to enjoy the serenity of their trees. **Kopoha** eagerly participates, but her size makes her a menace to smaller dancers. While **Kopoha** is dancing, a character must keep those around the empyrean safe, perhaps by maneuvering her around the dance floor with a successful DC 14 (Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand) check.

If the characters fail at helping **Kopoha** dance safely, she accidentally knocks over some dryads or damages a tree. Embarrassed, the empyrean insists on leaving immediately.

If the characters succeed, **Kopoha** has a great time and dances for an hour. While taking a break, she shares one of the truths from the "*Titanic Pain*" section. Afterward, she's ready to move on to another celebration.

#### Pixie Parade

*"This song's about me!"*Ã¢ÂÂ Tyuffayn Tinilyn, pixie celebrant (known as "Faerie Fire" but not for the reasons you think)The **pixies** of Goodberry Grove party hard, and their party is in full swing. Wine, juice, and fruit desserts flow along with music and laughter among the toadstools. If the characters enter the party, they're shrunk down to pixie size, while **Kopoha** becomes the size of a halfling. This delights the empyrean, and she tests her strength by picking up tiny mushroom structures or visiting forest animals. **Kopoha**'s feats and boasting quickly irritate the pixies. A character can make this more entertaining by succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma (Performance) check or by otherwise casting **Kopoha**'s efforts as charming.

If the characters fail to compensate for **Kopoha**'s boasting, the pixies ask the characters and the empyrean to leave.

If the characters succeed, the pixies encourage **Kopoha**. She insists on taking a break after an hour. While doing so, she shares one of the truths from the "*Titanic Pain*" section. Afterward, **Kopoha** wants to move on to a new party.

#### Skull Bocce

Amid a field of memorials, a retired god of the dead and a retinue of skeletons and morbidly dressed competitors play a casual, good-natured game of bocce. The god (perhaps Jergal, an apathetic former god of death) invites **Kopoha** and the characters to play, but instead of normal balls, they're using the skulls of the group's skeletons. **Kopoha** is eager to play but is both bad at the game (which she's never played) and far too competitive for this group. She might also attempt to use the Mosaic Mimir as a ballÃ¢ÂÂwhich doesn't harm it but might make some characters anxious. A character must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check or Charisma (Persuasion) check to help **Kopoha** either win or deal with her loss gracefully.

If the characters fail, **Kopoha** throws a tantrum that annoys the god. The god insists **Kopoha** and the group leave, or their skulls will be used for the next game.

If the characters succeed, the game goes well, but eventually the god decides to move on. **Kopoha** takes a break and shares one of the truths from the "*Titanic Pain*" section. Afterward, she wants to move on to a new party.

*"My guy, I get it. We've all got some afterlife or eternity or obliteration to get to, but right now, I'm on break. Now, watch this throw."*Ã¢ÂÂ Ose Obol-Eyes, merrenoloth ferryman and skull bocce champion
#### Widow's Henge

In a silent glade, a ring of standing stones surrounds a fallen menhir. The toppled rock is laden with an inviting but unattended feast. Any local or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check knows that this is Widow's Henge and that anyone who eats from the stone vanishes.

A character can dare **Kopoha** to eat a portion of the feast by succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. If a character knows the legends about Widow's Henge, this is abjectly not a good act and could affect the character's alignment. If **Kopoha** eats from the feast, she vanishes the next time she is out of the characters' sight and doesn't return. The same happens to any character who eats from the feast, but the character's incarnation reappears after an hour with no memory of what happened.

#### Other Celebrations

There are countless other celebrations around Sylvania. Use the events here and challenges like those outlined in the "*Contests*" section of *chapter 9* to create more festivities and chances for **Kopoha** to confide in the characters.

### Closing Time

The characters' celebrations with **Kopoha** might end in the following ways:

- **Chance to Think.** After **Kopoha** shares all the information from the "*Titanic Pain*" section, she grows introspective. She thanks the characters and tells them she has decided to go talk to her sister, Alethira, about what's on her mind. Before **Kopoha** departs, she gives the characters a *periapt of wound closure* that resembles her face.
- **Missing Titan.** If **Kopoha** goes missing while celebrating with the characters, Danai is displeased but upholds her end of their deal. Afterward, the spiritor asks the characters never to return to Sylvania.
- **Titan's Rage.** If the characters mock **Kopoha**'s feelings or encourage self-indulgent behavior, the rampage Spiritor Danai feared comes to pass. **Kopoha**'s trail of destruction eventually leads out of town, and she's not seen in Sylvania again. This disappoints Danai, but she helps the characters find the gate to Arborea nevertheless.

### Conclusion

Danai finds the characters soon after **Kopoha** departs and leads the characters to the gate to Arborea. The portal currently resides in an overgrown well in the forest outside town. The spiritor then returns to Sylvania to attend to other ongoing parties. If the characters are still in Danai's good graces, she might invite them to join her for one more celebration.

When the characters are ready to leave Sylvania, consult the "*Advancing in Level*" section of *chapter 4* and let the characters determine their next destination.

## Chapter 12Ã¢ÂÂOutlands Explorations

This chapter presents encounters for use while characters explore the Outlands. These events aren't vital to the adventure and can be used in any order. Some reinforce recurring themes in the adventure, while others are exciting digressions. Use these events and the *encounter tables* in *Morte's Planar Parade* to further develop the Outlands. These events don't influence when characters advance in level.

### Planar Glitch

The characters' incarnations are just one manifestation of the planar instability caused by the inaccurate beliefs of modrons lost in the Outlands (see *chapter 15*). At any point during the characters' exploration of the Outlands, they might experience one of the events on the Glitch Encounters table.

### Angels in the Outlands

*"If you think you're prepared for the ultimate struggle between good and evil, the deciding contest between all that is righteous and all that is foul, then to you I say, 'Play ball!'"*Ã¢ÂÂ Valorlayn the Adamant, hound archon Spireball playerEvery three hundred years, Celestials and Fiends gather to play a ballgame in observance of an ancient agreement between a god and a demon lord. The victors of this match claim a priceless trophy: the fate of an innocent soul.

The encounter begins when the characters happen on the playing field. Read the following text:

>>A gigantic flat diamond, its three points marked with squat pedestals, shimmers within a ringed field. Celestials in radiant uniforms practice at swatting glowing orbs on one side of the field, while elephantine demons on the other side trumpet at them through barbed trunks to break their concentration.
>>
>>A boxy, winged modron in a padded helmet with a face cage hovers in front of your castle. "Greetings! It appears you've stumbled on our ballgame," reports the modron. "Care to participate?"
>>

The **quadrone**, G041, is an impartial umpire appointed to observe the ball-and-stick game, which is called Spireball. The modron happily explains the game's rules, its stakes, and the two teams, all of which are detailed below.

#### Good versus Evil

Two teamsÃ¢ÂÂthe Noxious Stampede and the Righteous HandsÃ¢ÂÂvie for a single soul in the Outlands. Both teams need players, but the characters can join only one. Alternatively, the characters can join neither and instead influence the game's outcome from afar.

#### Noxious Stampede

The Noxious Stampede consists of nine **maelephants** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). Their star pitcher, who goes by "Snot Rocket," shoots stinking balls from its trunk like a cannon. The Fiends are sore losers and insufferable winners.

#### Righteous Hands

A team of Celestials, the Righteous Hands consist of eight **hound archons** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) and their star player, a **deva** named **Shariel** whose flanged mace rings deeply when it connects with its target. The Righteous Hands are paragons of sportsmanship and honesty, rooting for each other and never disrespecting their opponents, no matter how low the Noxious Stampede stoops.

#### Spireball Rules

![{@creature Shariel|ToFW}, Star Player of the Righteous Hands](img/adventure/ToFW/040-02-012.shariel.webp)

Spireball takes place on a flat, triangular diamond surrounded by a ringed field. Three low pedestals at each of the triangle's points serve as bases. The last of these, where batters take their swings, is known as home plate. During the game, batters navigate these bases in order from home plate to first base, first base to second base, and second base back to home plate. The game has the following rules.

#### Setup

The offensive team rolls initiative to determine the batting order. Meanwhile, the defensive team designates a pitcher, who stands in the middle of the triangle facing home plate; all other participants on that team are fielders.

#### Batting

On their turn, each batter makes a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the batter hits the ball with their implement and sends it flying into the field, and the batter attempts to move to first base. The defensive team can try to catch the ball (see the "Catching" section).

Each batter can attempt this check up to three times; after three failed checks, the batter strikes out and must stand down, and the next batter steps up to home plate.

***Home Run.*** A batter who rolls a 20 on the die hits a home run. The defending team doesn't get a chance to catch the ball, and the batter and every other team member currently on a base reach home plate.

#### Catching

If a batter hits the ball, the defensive team moves to catch it. One fielder of your choice must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the batter is out and must stand down. On a failed check, the batter advances to first base, moving any other batters ahead of them forward by one base.

#### Scoring Points

Spireball has three bases corresponding to its three pedestals. Each time a batter returns from second base to home plate, their team scores 1 point.

The round ends when three batters are out, either by striking out or by having their ball caught, at which point the two teams switch places.

#### Play Ball!

Once the characters chose their team or decline, the game begins. The Righteous Hands are first to bat.

The game ends after each team has played offense and defense once. The outcome of the encounter hinges on the winning team and whether the characters assisted them.

#### Noxious Stampede Wins

If evil triumphs, members of the Noxious Stampede revel with Abyssal brags and celebratory gestures. If the characters joined this team or reveal they secretly assisted the maelephants from the sidelines, Snot Rocket produces a slimy *eversmoking bottle* and gives it to one of the characters.

#### Righteous Hands Win

If good prevails, the Righteous Hands celebrate and offer to shake hands with their opponents, who refuse the Celestials' gesture of goodwill. If the characters joined the Righteous Hands, **Shariel** gifts the characters with a prismatic chalice from Mount Celestia that functions as a *gem of brightness*.

If the characters reveal they helped the Righteous Hands from the sidelines in some way, **Shariel** still awards the chalice but shamefully notifies the modron umpire. The angel asks for a rematch in a year, adding "cheaters never truly win."

#### Tie Game

If the teams tie, the soul's fate is delayed for three hundred years. Both teams are visibly disappointed.

### Mausoleum of Chronepsis

*"Chronepsis's Mausoleum is huge! Gigantic like no city you've ever seen. Sure, there's the dragonsÃ¢ÂÂand Chronepsis himselfÃ¢ÂÂbut how many wyrms could there be? Like, a hundred? How hard could it be to steal something from a city with only a hundred folks in it?"*Ã¢ÂÂ Master Thief Hie Akee, before his disappearanceIn these encounters, a dragon disconnected from the linear flow of time befriends the characters. Use these scenes in the following order, with the first occurring after characters visit a gate-town or two.

The encounter starts while the characters are in the walking castle. There's a boom and the castle sags, as if something heavy just landed on it. When a character investigates, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Coiled atop the walking castle is a mighty, pearl-colored dragon with branch-like horns. Its brilliant eyes fix on you. In a warm, slow voice that sounds as though it were coming from far away, it says, "My old friend. How good it is to see you again."
>>

This is Renesnuprah, an **adult time dragon** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). Renesnuprah warmly greets the characters by name and calls them friends. She can share general details about each of them. Use the following details to guide the conversation with the time dragon:

- Renesnuprah claims to know the characters from when they first met hundreds of years ago. The characters have no memory of this meeting.
- The dragon realizes she might not have met the characters at this point in time. She doesn't elaborate, as she fears interfering with events to come.
- Renesnuprah gives the characters a *talisman of the sphere* and says, "Give this to the one who sees silver." She explains the characters will understand in time.

If attacked or driven off, the dragon is saddened but leaves behind the *talisman of the sphere*.

![Dragons from across the planes visit the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, seeking to learn the secrets of fate](img/adventure/ToFW/041-02-013.chronepsis.webp)

#### The Witch and the Wyrmling

This encounter occurs after the characters have the previous experience with Renesnuprah and visit another gate-town or two. The encounter begins while the characters are in their walking castle, and they hear a panicked cry from outside. When a character investigates, read or paraphrase the following:

>>A cerulean dragonÃ¢ÂÂno bigger than a huskyÃ¢ÂÂfrantically flaps its wings as it barrels toward the walking castle. It nearly crashes and quickly tries to hide amid the structure's sculpted facade.
>>
>>Pursing the dragon is a woman with wild gray hair streaked with crimson. She rides a flying, red broom and wears matching red goggles. An oversized birdcage dangles from her broom."
>>

The dragon is Renesnuprah, now a **time dragon wyrmling** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) reduced to 10 hit points. The dragon quickly spots a character and begs to be hidden from the witch. If asked, the dragon refers to herself as Reenee.

The witch is Trikante, a neutral evil **archmage** on a *broom of flying*. Her mirrored goggles prevent others from seeing her eyes. She demands the characters give back her property. If asked, she shares the following details:

- She is Trikante, one of the greatest magical researchers the planes have ever known.
- She's conducting magical experiments that are surely beyond the characters' understanding.
- She purchased a time dragon for good money in the gate-town of *Ribcage*. The time dragon escaped, and she wants it back.

Reenee doesn't elaborate, but the wyrmling knows Trikante has dire plans for her.

If the characters don't stop Trikante, the mage easily recaptures Reenee and departs. If the characters intervene, she laughs but entertains trade offers. If the characters offer Trikante anything, she removes her goggles to get a better look. The character with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices her eyes are silver pools. Trikante will accept any magic item of legendary rarity in trade, such as a *talisman of the sphere*. If she's given such an item, she leaves Reenee alone and departs.

If the characters attack Trikante, she is a formidable foe. She fights until she's allowed to reclaim the wyrmling or she's reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, at which point she flees on her broom.

#### Wyrm Reception

If Trikante is dealt with, Reenee thanks the characters and says the following:

>>After taking a moment to catch her breath, the wyrmling lets out a long sigh. "Woo wee! First it was kidnappers, then nasty merchants in Ribcage, then that witch. I thought I was a goner! Thanks bunches for helping me out. I'm Renee!" The dragon pauses and looks around uncertainly. "You wouldn't know where home is, would ya?"
>>

Reenee was kidnapped and wants to get home, but she can't tell the characters more. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check knows that time dragons dwell in the *Mausoleum of Chronepsis*Ã¢ÂÂlair of a god-like dragon with unique insights into draconic fate. Characters can also learn this by spending an hour researching in the walking castle's library. If the characters share this information with Reenee, she asks them to take her to the mausoleum when they can. She doesn't rush the characters, so include the wyrmling in the adventure for as long as the characters like.

#### The Mausoleum

This event occurs when the characters near the Mausoleum of Chronepsis while the time dragon Reenee is with them. As soon as the mausoleum is within sight, read the following description:

>>From an expanse of ruins and dragon bones rises a great fortress. On its towering facade, brilliant light beams from an opening shaped like an hourglass. High above wheel the silhouettes of soaring dragons.
>>

As soon as the mausoleum is in sight, Reenee asks the characters to stop the walking castle. She knows the dragons are territorial, and she doesn't want to provoke them by bringing the castle closer. If the characters treated Reenee well, she thanks each character personally and gifts the group one of her scales. She then flaps off.

#### Scales of Time

If Reenee leaves the characters one of her scales, as the characters are departing the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, read the following:

>>As the walking castle strides away from the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, a shadow passes overhead. A massive shape settles atop a nearby ruin. It's a gigantic, ancient-looking time dragon with huge, branching horns that pulse with opalescent energy. A voice like a whisper reaches you: "Call, and I'll be there."
>>
>>With that, a portal of swirling colors opens around mighty dragon. The great wyrm fades into it, then the portal vanishes.
>>

The dragon is Renesnuprah as an **ancient time dragon** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). She departs before the characters can act. The scale Reenee left begins to glow as it transforms into the following charm (a type of supernatural gift detailed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

- Time of the Dragon

### Semuanya's Bog

In this encounter, a group of lizardfolk petitioners invite the characters to join them in visiting the realm of the lizardfolk deity Semuanya. Use this encounter wherever and whenever you please, particularly to lighten the mood after exploring a somber gate-town like Curst or Rigus.

The encounter starts when the characters hear a group of jovial cheers outside the walking castle. Read or paraphrase the following text when a character investigates:

>>A group of a dozen lizardfolk cheer as one among them strains, then hefts a barrel-sized boulder over her head. She holds it for a moment, then lets it drop to the ground amid even more cheers.
>>

A character who understands Draconic can hear the lizardfolk shouting support and cheering the lifter's "new personal best." The focus of the lizardfolk soon shifts to either the walking castle or any visible character. They energetically wave and ask the characters to stop for a minute.

#### Lizardfolk Competitors

The twelve **lizardfolk** are friendly Celestial *petitioners* (detailed in *Morte's Planar Parade*). They are led by the largest of their number: the colorfully frilled Sesspech. She introduces herself and eagerly shares the following information:

- She and her companions have just completed a jog around the Outlands and are on their way back to the realm of their god, Semuanya.
- Semuanya is a deity of survival, athleticism, and physical prowess widely revered by lizardfolk.
- The lizardfolk are tired from their years-long jog and would appreciate a lift to *Semuanya's Bog*.
- The lizardfolk can't offer much, but they're certain their fellows in Semuanya's realm will welcome and reward the characters.

If the characters refuse, the lizardfolk understand and take it as a sign from their deity to push themselves toward greater gains. If the characters agree, the lizardfolk are appreciative. They board the walking castle and take to sunning themselves and doing light stretches on the terrace. The lizardfolk are polite passengers, full of encouragement, lifestyle advice, and enthusiasm for varied athletic pursuits.

*"What's my secret? Well, I died, but then I started working out and seeing serious gains!"*Ã¢ÂÂ Visshear Sher, crocodile toss champion and devotee of Semuanya
#### Reaching Semuanya's Bog

The lizardfolk can travel with the characters for as long as you like. When the group finally reaches Semuanya's Bog, read the following text:

>>The domain of the deity Semuanya is a pleasant-smelling swamp full of bright flowers and colorful bugs. Through trees draped in vibrant moss come the cheers of lizardfolk engaged in competition.
>>

Sesspech thanks the characters for bringing her group home and invites them to relax in Semuanya's Bog. If the characters decline, she thanks them again, and she and her companions depart. If you so choose, the lizardfolk might appear later when the characters need aid.

If the characters enter Semuanya's Bog with Sesspech, they're welcomed as guests. They can rest here for as long as they want, and followers of Semuanya can cast *cure wounds*, *greater restoration*, or *reincarnate* if the characters ask.

If the characters ask to meet Semuanya, a lizardfolk tells them that the deity comes and goes unpredictably, but that Semuanya often appears to those who accomplish some great physical feat.

![Athletic petitioners train and compete in the swampy realm of the lizardfolk deity, Semuanya](img/adventure/ToFW/042-02-014.petitioners.webp)

#### Contests in Semuanya's Bog

Life is good but not easy in *Semuanya's Bog*. The spirits of lizardfolk champions engage in endless competition here. If the characters wish to join them, they're welcomed. Run any of the competitions from the Semuanya's Bog Contests table as detailed in the "*Contests*" section of *chapter 9*.

##### Semuanya's Bog Contests
|  d4 | Contest                        |  DC | Ability Check           |

|  4  | Swimming race or weightlifting |  17 | Strength (Athletics)    |

#### Meeting Semuanya

If the characters win three or more competitions, a manifestation of the god Semuanya appears. This manifestation of Semuanya is a muscular, 8-foot-tall lizardfolk. They have no game statistics and vanish if attacked.

Semuanya is bombastic. They think they're amazing and that everyone in their realm is also amazingÃ¢ÂÂthis includes the characters. Semuanya compliments the characters on their victories and rewards them with a trophy made of eternally blooming flowers and a small green dragon skull. The trophy functions as an *alchemy jug*, but in addition to the liquids it can normally produce, it can create up to half a gallon of effervescent spring water. However, it can't produce beer, mayonnaise, or wine.

If the characters question Semuanya, the lizardfolk deity claims to know nothing of any disruptions in the Outlands or conflicts beyond the recent competitions in their bog. Soon after, Semuanya grows bored and departs to judge some fantastic competition elsewhere on the planes.

## Chapter 13Ã¢ÂÂSecrets of the Spire

Once the characters restore the Mosaic Mimir's missing data, the magic device relates the information from "*The Last Great Modron March*" section in *chapter 4*. From this, the characters learn that the missing modron, **R04M**, likely followed the march's path to Dendradis, a rilmani community carved into the Spire. Upon traveling to Dendradis, the characters meet Ascetelis, a rilmani who offers to escort them into the Spire where the modron was last seen. Within the Spire, surrounded by mysteries of the multiverse, the characters finally catch up to **R04M**Ã¢ÂÂbut they're not the first to do so.

### Dendradis

Beings of absolute neutrality, rilmani originate from the Outlands, and their few communities cling to the Spire. These crystalline cloisters rise in clusters of crooked towers or fill natural crevices.

Among the largest of these communities is Dendradis, a lattice of crystalline structures weaving between the walls of a mile-high fissure in the Spire. Home to hundreds of rilmani, the town is accessed by a single gate. Within, a maze of corridors and ramps connects scattered dormitories, communal work halls, and chambers where varied scrying methods are used to monitor the planes. Visitors aren't welcome inside without an escort.

#### Unwelcome to Dendradis

When the characters approach Dendradis, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>Ahead rises the Spire, the infinitely tall, tapered column at the heart of the Outlands. While its height is lost amid clouds and the boundaries of sight, its lower reaches spread in wild foothills.
>>
>>As you approach the base of the Spire, a narrow seam in its stony slope comes into view. The fissure is filled with a lattice of rainbow-colored crystals. Tiny windows and distant figures reveal these crystals to be towers and bridges, interweaving across the fissure. The structures obscure a great shape within the cavity: a giant, fossilized, multilimbed body.
>>
>>At the seam's base stands a glimmering, crooked tower with a prominent gate. Two gray figures with armored bodies and bladed limbs flank the gate.
>>

Two **ferrumach rilmani** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) guard the entrance to Dendradis. They're indifferent to the characters but refuse to let non-rilmani enter without a rilmani escort. They turn hostile should anyone try to infiltrate the town. The ferrumachs share the name of the town, but they know nothing of **R04M**. The rilmani don't comment on the mysterious body their city is sealing back into the Spire. Feel free to develop or ignore this mystery as you please.

*"Rilmani abet good, evil, law, and chaos to maintain their vision of equilibrium, no matter the cost. What does that mean? It means I'd rather deal with demons. At least with them I know what to expect!"*Ã¢ÂÂ Sazraen Tildoma, Fraternity of Order scholar
#### Ascetelis

Before the characters depart or the situation with the ferrumachs grows too tense, a third rilmani arrives from inside. Read or paraphrase the following text:

![Dendradis, a Rilmani Community in the Spire](img/adventure/ToFW/043-02-015.dendradis.webp)

>>A third rilmani strides from the gate. This figure is leaner than the others, with a copper cast to their skin. They're reading a scroll intently, but they look up as they draw near. This new rilmani halts and does a double-take, looking from you to the scroll and back again. The newcomer then approaches, holds up the parchment, and asks: "Excuse me. Is this you?"
>>

This is Ascetelis, a **cuprilach rilmani** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). In her hand is a scroll bearing the name of each character along with a brief and unflattering but accurate description. The final line reads, "**R04M**. Modron. Mismatched."

Ascetelis is friendly, and she comes across as easy to impress, with a welcoming, folksy charm. She quickly explains she was just coming to look for the characters. She asks if **R04M** is with them and gives an "aw-shucks" snap of her fingers when it's clear the modron isn't.

If asked why she's looking for the characters, Ascetelis explains her superiors have deemed the modron **R04M** a threat to multiversal balance. She hopes to find the modron and return it to Dendradis so her leaders can determine what to do with it. She's also been given the characters' names, as the rilmani know the characters have been inquiring about the modron and might know its whereabouts.

If the characters share that they've heard **R04M** is in the area, Ascetelis is clearly surprised, and she says the following:

>>"I'll be! Well, they say good luckÃ¢ÂÂlike all thingsÃ¢ÂÂhappens in threes. Sounds like we've got another surprise in store!"
>>

Ascetelis then asks if the characters will join her in searching for **R04M**. She doesn't know where to go next but offers to escort the characters into Dendradis so they can ask around and see if anyone has seen the modron.

#### Ascetelis's Goals

Ascetelis, like most cuprilachs, is a spy and assassin. She doesn't tell the characters about her role, that the scroll she's holding is a hit list, or that she's been ordered to slay **R04M** and the characters for being threats to multiversal balance. She legitimately doesn't know where **R04M** is and wants to tag along with the characters until they find the modron. Then she plans to manufacture their collective doom.

Until then, Ascetelis is cheery and eager to help her new, temporary friends.

#### Tracking R04M

Hunting **R04M** might lead the characters into Dendradis or to explore the Spire on their own terms. Ascetelis either joins or follows the characters.

#### Rumors in Dendradis

With Ascetelis as an escort, the characters can enter Dendradis and ask residents what they know about **R04M**.

Inside, Dendradis is a labyrinth of beautiful crystals and base metals inhabited entirely by rilmani. So long as Ascetelis is with the characters, the local rilmani ignore them. Rilmani who find an unattended character rush to alert the authorities, who send four **ferrumach rilmani** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) to evict the trespasser with as little violence as possible.

***Questioning Rilmani.*** Ascetelis suggests the group find and question rilmani artisans called plumachs. These rilmani harvest crystals from the Spire and might have seen **R04M**. It takes Ascetelis an hour to find a plumach willing to acknowledge the characters. There's a problem, though. Even among rilmani, plumachs are notorious for avoiding strangers and their troubles. A character can get a plumach to talk by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A character gains advantage on this check if the plumach is offered 250 gp worth of a rare material useful for crafting or the characters promise that after this conversation, no one in the group will ever speak to the plumach again.

If a character gets a plumach to talk, the rilmani shares that a modron was seen in the caves within the Spire called the Desert of Rust. The plumach or Ascetelis can direct the characters there (see the following section).

If the group fails to get the plumach to speak with them, Ascetelis can find them another plumach willing to talk, but doing so takes 1d4 hours. Plumachs avoid conflict; they use the same stat block as **ferrumach rilmani** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*).

#### Steps along the Spire

Characters who spend a day searching the region around Dendradis for signs of **R04M** can make a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check. If they succeed, they find the tracks of a lone monodrone leading into a narrow cave. The cave runs for nearly a mile, then opens into the *Desert of Rust* (see the following section). The characters can't be certain these are **R04M**'s tracksÃ¢ÂÂparticularly if they're not sure what type of modron **R04M** isÃ¢ÂÂbut it's the best lead they find.

### Inside the Spire

As mysterious as the Spire is, even less is known about what lies inside it. Just as the Spire's exterior poses an endless, unclimbable ascent, its interior holds a labyrinth of infinite tunnels and vertical hollows. Unknown to most except the rilmani, the Spire holds more than just these natural caves. Its caverns are lined with eerie rock formations and the eroded ruins of inexplicable structures. The Spire is hostile to magic, and many creatures instinctively avoid its dark, stifling interior.

#### Spire Interior Features

The tunnels in the Spire have the following features:

- **Antimagic Pockets.** The Spire is protected by invisible, drifting pockets of antimagic. Anytime a creature casts a spell, there is a 10 percent chance it triggers an *antimagic field* spell, centered on the caster and lasting for 5 minutes.
- **Darkness.** The interior of the Spire is dark. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.
- **Preternatural Silence.** The Spire's interior is still and silent. Sound travels half as far as it would under normal circumstances. Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing are made with disadvantage.

#### Desert of Rust

This miles-wide cavern within the Spire is covered in flakes of rust and, in some rare cases, fragments of eroded blades. Every few moments, a harmless metal scrap falls from above and clinks against the cavern floor. The cavern has no ceilingÃ¢ÂÂit rises endlessly into the infinite hollow of the Spire's interior.

Ascetelis can tell the characters that rilmani artisans occasionally scavenge useful materials from the cave, but most of the detritus from above is worthless.

Characters find evidence of **R04M**'s passage after searching for 5 hours or by searching for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check. This path leads up an incline toward a series of tunnels.

### Climbing the Spire

**R04M**'s path climbs the Spire's interior. If the characters follow, they pass through gradually sloping tunnels that take hours or even days to traverse. Use any of the following encounters as the characters climb. When you're ready to conclude this section, run the "*Scholar of Impossibilities*" encounter.

#### Memory from Elsewhere

As the characters ascend the Spire, they witness mysterious sights. These scenes aren't dangerous, but you can elaborate on them as you please. Roll on or choose a result from the Sights within the Spire table to break up the characters' climb.

##### Sights within the Spire
|  d4 | Sight                                                                                                                                                                                |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A statue of a giant, three-eyed horse juts from a cavern wall. It's so heavily eroded, it looks melted.                                                                              |
|  2  | As the party skirts a vertical hollow, a body falls past them. A character who manages to catch the body finds that it's an ages-old, rag-clad elf skeleton.                         |
|  3  | A misshapen arch is covered in drooping, metallic, blade-like decorations. The arch was once a portal to a matching gate elsewhere in the Spire, but the portal no longer functions. |
|  4  | A character finds a coin from a familiar world or nation, but its markings refer to a land or ruler no one has heard of.                                                             |

#### The Whisker

>>A long and narrow span of wiry metal forms a bridge across a hollow in the Spire. Other metallic protrusions jut from the vertical walls.
>>

This 200-foot-long, 5-foot-wide bridge connects the characters' path with tunnels ahead. A character who inspects the metallic bridge sees it is covered in fine metal growths. Characters can tell that the bridge is natural, and although it can bear the characters' weight, it is fragile.

***Damaging the Bridge.*** Each 5-foot segment of the bridge is a Large object with AC 15, 10 hit points, vulnerability to lightning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If any segment of the bridge is destroyed, the entire structure crumbles, causing creatures on it to fall. This part of the Spire has no ceiling or floor. Any creature that falls into the hollow plummets until rescued.

***Piercer Demigod.*** This crossing is home to the demigod Kirgaz Vizt the Unerring Avalanche, one of the few deities of **ropers** and **piercers**. Kirgaz uses the **piercer** stat block, with the following adjustments:

- If slain, Kirgaz is restored to life somewhere in the Outlands 24 hours later.
- Kirgaz can cast *teleport* without spell components once per day. The demigod is considered very familiar with the area around its obsession (see below).

Kirgaz hides amid stalactites 30 feet over the bridge and uses its Drop action on the last character to cross. If Kirgaz misses, its Drop action affects the bridge, potentially damaging or destroying it.

Legends of Kirgaz say the demigod has never missed a target. If Kirgaz uses its Drop action and misses its target, the demigod becomes obsessed with that creature. Employing its immortality and ability to teleport, Kirgaz haunts the target of its obsession, dropping from unlikely places day after day until it strikes the creature. After doing so, Kirgaz is satisfied and returns to the Spire.

#### Tomb of the Frog

On entering this area, the character with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score hears heavy breathing. Those who investigate see the following:

>>This broad cave is humid and covered in thick mold. At the center sprawls a greasy, gray, wart-covered giant. He stares hopelessly into the darkness above. Dozens of crudely carved, amphibian figurines surround the hulk, staring expectantly with bulbous eyes.
>>

This cavern is roughly circular and hundreds of feet across, and it has a 30-foot-high ceiling. A tunnel on the opposite wall exits the chamber and leads higher into the Spire.

The giant has features suggestive of a human mixed with a fantastically ugly toad. He uses the **fomorian** stat block. The creature is in a deep despair and is indifferent to the characters. Creatures that don't disturb him can walk past him unimpeded.

If one or more characters make themselves known to the giant, he turns his head and addresses them:

>>"Are you here to worship me?"
>>

If one or more characters say yes, the giant invites them to sit with him. If no characters say yes, he goes back to staring.

Characters who speak with the giant get lethargic responses but can eventually learn that he believes he's a god whose followers forgot him, and now even he has forgotten who he is. The giant has no hope of regaining his memory or powersÃ¢ÂÂif he ever had any.

***Followers of the Frog.*** The giant urges characters who speak with him to become the first of his new followers. He ignores characters who refuse, but he's pleased if any characters agree and bids them to spread word of his perfection. Characters who agree to follow the giantÃ¢ÂÂeven if they're insincereÃ¢ÂÂhear faint croaking (that only they can hear) whenever they rest or cast a spell within the next 7 days. The croaking vanishes after this time, the giant having forgotten the characters.

***Slaying the Giant.*** The giant defends himself if attacked, and turns hostile if the characters antagonize him. During battle, any creature affected by the giant's Curse of the Evil Eye action gains amphibian-like features. If the giant is slain, his body rapidly decays into a heap of mold. From the remains grow 2d4 magical, neon-green toadstools. A creature that consumes one of these 3-inch toadstools is affected as if by a *potion of water breathing*.

***Frog Figures.*** All one hundred and eighteen of these misshapen amphibian figurines are worthless, but each looks uniquely shocked.

### Scholar of Impossibilities

Run this encounter when you're ready to bring the hunt for **R04M** to an end.

>>The tunnel ends in a ledge overlooking a vast, empty crevasse. No path clearly proceeds above or below.
>>
>>"Looking for friends, hmm?" comes a cloyingly shrill voice. The words emanate from a crack in the cavern wall fifteen feet above the ledge. A rotten stench emanates from within.
>>

It's easy to climb the stone wall to the 10-foot-wide, 25-foot-deep crag above. The space within is cramped, with a 6-foot-high ceiling. This forces the **baernaloth** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) inside to contort its gangly form in a painful-looking crouch. Around the baernaloth, the walls are smeared with blasphemous symbols, and foul icons dangle from twine made from hair.

#### The Scholar

This baernaloth is an evil being that calls itself the Scholar. It is curious about the characters and seeks to expose them to its corruptive ideas. Should a character converse with it, the Scholar speaks cryptically while sharing the following information:

- It saw a modron climb past its crag recently. It wouldn't suggest following it, thoughÃ¢ÂÂthe darkness above is hungry.
- The Scholar seeks truths of the multiverse, both this one and those that came before.
- It believes that when the time comes, it will be able to change the multiverse to suit its vision of profane perfection.
- The Scholar will share a secret no mortal was meant to know with one interested character (see the "Secrets of Eternity" section below).

If the characters ignore the baernaloth, leave its cave, or refuse its offers, it lets them go.

If the Scholar is attacked, it fights to defend itself. The cave isn't considered the baernaloth's lair, so it can't take lair actions here. If the Scholar is defeated, characters who search the cavern find a cleft surrounded by foul, bleeding runes. Inside is the *Book of Vile Darkness*.

#### Secrets of Eternity

If a character agrees to let the Scholar share a forbidden secret, the baernaloth requests that the character come close and let it whisper in their ear. The baernaloth then speaks in a language the character doesn't know but somehow understands. If the character lets the Scholar speak for a full minute, the character's mind is flooded with terrible knowledge. The character can't process the entirety of that knowledge, but what they can articulate is summarized by a secret from the Impossible Knowledge table or another mystery of your creation. The veracity and implications of these secrets are up to you.

##### Impossible Knowledge
|  d4 | Secret                                                                                                                                                  |

The Scholar shares its secret with only one character. That character gains the following charm (a type of supernatural gift detailed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

- Eyes of the Impossible

### Ravenous Darkness

After a 100-foot climb past the Scholar's lair, the chasm opens onto a 30-foot-wide, 100-foot-long ledge. When the party approaches, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>Nearly invisible strands of black webbing fill the hollow space above a broad ledge in the chasm wall. At the heart of the web hangs an indistinct form of greasy shadows and spidery limbs. Its unsettling, long limbs reach toward a number of bulbous cocoons in the web, at least one of which is still twitching.
>>

The creature here is a **darkweaver** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*). As soon as it spots other creatures, it attacks and fights to the deathÃ¢ÂÂall the while narrating the ways it plans to prepare and consume its prey. If Ascetelis is with the party, she doesn't aid the characters in fighting the darkweaver.

![In the hollow heights of the Spire, RO4M struggles in a darkweaver's web](img/adventure/ToFW/044-02-016.darkweaver.webp)

The wriggling cocoon is a Medium object with AC 11, 8 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Inside is the errant modron, **R04M** (see the following section).

The web holds four other cocoons. Each contains the bones of a long-dead Humanoid. The last cocoon opened also contains a conical hat covered in stars and a *wand of wonder*.

#### R04M, Sigil's Most Wanted

**R04M** is a neutral good **monodrone** with an Intelligence of 8. He speaks Common and Modron. **R04M** is earnest, naive, and desperate to leave the Spire. He shares the following details once out of peril:

- His name is **R04M**.
- He says he fled Sigil because "a fancy fox fiend was trying to disassemble him."
- This fox fiend is holding modrons hostage in a secret prison. The modrons are doing things that are bad for the planes (he can't expoundÃ¢ÂÂit's just bad).
- He escaped this secret prison but was captured and taken to a fancy place. He used a platinum casino chip he found and escaped through a portal behind a big wheel. He still has this chip.
- **R04M** traveled through Sigil and the Outlands to hide but also to follow the path of the last Great Modron March, hoping to complete the march he started long ago and learn how the trapped modrons are disrupting the planes.
- **R04M** can tell the characters are affected by the disruption the fox fiend's modrons are causing.
- The modron doesn't know where to go, but he'd like to leave the Spire. He won't go to Sigil, where he's afraid the fox fiend will get him.

**R04M**'s story contradicts what Shemeshka told the party, and he has never been her accountant. The easiest way to reconcile these discrepancies is to confront Shemeshka (see the *following chapter*). The modron gives the characters the platinum casino chip he used to escape Fortune's Wheel (see *area F12* on *map 3.1*).

#### Escaping the Spire

Once they've conversed with **R04M**, the characters can leave the Spire however they like. On their way out, Ascetelis attempts to ambush and kill the characters and then **R04M**. She attacks whenever is most opportune, perhaps when the group again crosses the *Whisker* (detailed in this chapter).

While attacking the characters, Ascetelis makes it clear that this is just a job and that her betrayal is nothing personal. The glitches affecting the characters make them threats to the planes, and the rilmani have decided the characters' deaths are the surest way to end their menace.

After contending with Ascetelis, the characters aren't readmitted to Dendradis. However, **R04M** can show them a tunnel that connects the Desert of Rust with the exterior of the Spire. The characters can also find this tunnel after 1 hour of searching for an exit from the Desert of Rust. This chapter ends when the characters leave the Spire. Each character gains a level on escaping.

------

# Part 3: Secret Realities

## Chapter 14: Behind the Wheel

Having learned that Shemeshka might not be dealing with them honestly, the characters return to Sigil and Fortune's Wheel. There, **R04M**'s platinum chip grants the characters access to the casino's hidden Platinum Rooms and Shemeshka's private sanctum.

![Shemeshka admires a captive soul in her secret Abyssal realm, the House of Liars](img/adventure/ToFW/045-03-001.splash.webp)

### Return to Sigil

How the characters return to Sigil from the Outlands is up to them. The portal they initially used to reach the Outlands remains open, but if the party wants to use a different portal, one can be found within a day's travel of any gate-town or near any other Outlands site. **R04M**, the Castellan, or another NPC can provide this information.

If the characters haven't put together from **R04M**'s story that Shemeshka is up to no good, **Zaythir** or another ally can suggest the group should be wary on returning to Fortune's Wheel.

When they arrive in Sigil, the characters find it unchanged from when they departed. They can explore the city for as long as they please but should eventually return to Fortune's Wheel. Following **R04M**'s vague directions, they can find the portal behind the fortune's wheel game. A character who questions one of Shemeshka's employees at the casino and succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check can also learn there's a portal behind Fortune's Wheel, but most employees don't know how to open it.

*"Where's the center of the multiverse? Me. I'm the center of the multiverse. And not because of some philosophical brainteaser. Because I'm making it so."*Ã¢ÂÂ Shemeshka the Marauder
### The Platinum Rooms

Hidden through Fortune's Wheel's high-roller rooms lies a demiplanar hub that links to the multiverse's highest-stakes games of chance. Here, powerful beings and entities forbidden from entering Sigil gather to place bets on events where lives and the fates of worlds hang in the balance. Amid this network of hidden games of chance, Shemeshka keeps her personal sanctum and the true riches of Fortune's Wheel: the arcanaloth's trove of secrets.

#### Staff and Visitors

The Platinum Rooms are staffed by approximately a dozen lawful evil tieflings who use the **assassin** stat block. They politely mingle amid the gambling areas, facilitating betting and fetching visitors refreshments. This staff is directed by Colcook, Shemeshka's personal aide, who oversees the Platinum Rooms from *area P1*. These staff carry no treasure, but they can pay out a character's winnings at booths similar to that in area P1.

The Platinum Rooms attract a diverse crowd of strange and powerful players. These beings are focused on their entertainment. They have no interest in the characters or the characters' plans, and they won't use violence unless attacked. Use the Platinum Rooms Visitors table to inspire who the characters might meet in the Platinum Rooms.

##### Platinum Rooms Visitors
|  d6 | Visitor                                                                                          |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | An awakened animal or animate object on a winning streak                                         |
|  2  | A famous mage, such as Bigby, Evard, or Tasha                                                    |
|  3  | A noble from a planar empire, such as a githyanki warlord or a genie noble                       |
|  4  | A down-on-their-luck adult dragon of any type                                                    |
|  5  | An inscrutable being that loves gambling and manifests as a column of light, eyes, or lost socks |
|  6  | A god randomly chosen from a *deity list* in the *Player's Handbook*                             |

#### Guards

Two **warden archons** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) monitor the Platinum Rooms from *area P5*. Shemeshka won an eon of these archons' service in a deal with a Celestial lord, and the bearlike archonsÃ¢ÂÂone black-furred and the other whiteÃ¢ÂÂobey her dutifully. The warden archons visit *areas P1*Ã¢ÂÂ*P4* only if a disruption the tiefling staff can't handle occurs or if a patron is clearly cheating at the games. Any individual who wins at three or more of the games in the Platinum Rooms is considered a cheater. When the archons appear, they politely ask whoever's causing the disruption to come with them to *area P6*, where they lock away culprits. Characters can access area P5 only by having the warden archons open the portal from that area.

#### Interrogating the Staff

Shemeshka's staff are under orders to keep visitors happy and busy gambling while also listening for useful information. The staff have no interest in sharing information about themselves or Shemeshka. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, a character can convince Colcook or another staff member to share the following information:

- An unmarked portal in *Fortune's End* (see below) leads to Shemeshka's personal retreat, called the House of Liars. The unmarked portal is one-way and can be opened only from the opposite side.
- Guards on the other side of the portal monitor the Platinum Rooms for problems and cheaters.
- Any who win too many of the Platinum Rooms' games are considered cheaters. The guards open the portal to Fortune's End and take cheaters through it, where offenders are never seen again.

#### Platinum Room Features

![Platinum Razorleaf Casino Chip](img/adventure/ToFW/046-03-002.razorleaf-casino-chip.webp)

The Platinum Rooms share the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Enclosed areas have 15-foot-high ceilings.
- **Climate Control.** All the Platinum Rooms have breathable air, normal gravity, and a constant temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
- **Light.** Sconces lit by *continual flame* spells or sourceless overhead illumination fill each area with bright light.
- **Realms Beyond.** Each of the Platinum Rooms is on a different plane. The features here affect the areas on map 14.1 and 50 feet beyond that area. Beyond that, the plane functions as detailed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

### Platinum Room Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 14.1.

![Map 14.1: Platinum Rooms](img/adventure/ToFW/047-map-03.01-platinum-rooms.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/048-map-03.01-platinum-rooms-player.webp)
#### P1: Fortune's End

Read or paraphrase the following text when the characters first enter the area:

>>This roughly circular room is made of pitted bone. Along its perimeter stand several alcoves, four of which hold swirling portals. Two large hollows provide a view of vast, roiling nebulae beyond. At the room's center, a tiefling with barbs protruding from his scalp stands behind a desk of polished bone.
>>
>>"Welcome to the Platinum Rooms, illustrious guests," the tiefling says. "I'm Colcook, your concierge. If there's anything I can do to make your stay more comfortable, please let me know."
>>

The portal from Fortune's Wheel connects to the hollow skull of a dead god of misfortune floating at a far-flung edge of the Astral Plane. From here, portals connect to locations across the multiverse.

***Colcook.*** Colcook (lawful evil, tiefling **assassin**) is friendly and eager to serve. If the characters run out of platinum chips, he offers them one in exchange for a valuable secret, such as details about the attacks on Rigus from *chapter 10* or anything the Scholar in *chapter 13* told the characters. Colcook determines what counts as a valuable secret.

If coerced, he behaves as detailed in the "*Interrogating the Staff*" section. If compelled to aid the characters, Colcook encourages them to play and win at the Platinum Rooms' games to gain access to Shemeshka's chambers with minimum disruption.

***Platinum Room Portals.*** Three portals here connect to the gaming events that currently occupy the Platinum Rooms. The portals are permanently open, but opaque energy prevents creatures from seeing or hearing what lies on the other side. Each of these portals has a placard overhead, naming the event beyond. These placards and their portals are as follows:

- **Dungeonland.** A swirling, misty portal leads to area P2.
- **Supertemporal Arena.** A magenta portal leads to *area P3a*.
- **Fiend's Ante.** A crackling crimson portal leads to *area P4*.

***Shemeshka's Portal.*** An unopened, golden portal stands in an empty alcove to the north. This portal leads to Shemeshka's refuge. This portal can't be opened from this room; only creatures in *area P5* with the proper portal key can open it. Once opened, the portal remains open for 10 minutes.

#### P2: Dungeonland

>>An eclectic crowd of onlookers cheers as an image in a floating crystal depicts a knight being ravaged by a violet-striped saber-toothed tiger. Several similar drifting crystals display other armed individuals exploring ruins and engaging in death-defying feats. Beneath, on an island of bare stone floating amid a misty expanse, stands a plain archway and a circular desk attended by a well-dressed tiefling. Luminous symbols on a placard above the desk spell out "Bets," "Submissions," and "Enjoy Dungeonland!"
>>

Dungeonland is a game that takes place on a rocky cluster drifting in the Ethereal Plane. Participants watch a group of adventurers navigate a deadly dungeon and place bets on whether the adventurers will survive or die. The characters can influence the game by submitting magic items, which appear in the dungeon for the game's adventurers to find.

***Crystals.*** Four sizable, floating crystals drift about 8 feet off the ground. Each displays a scene from a lethally whimsical dungeon. The creatures depicted in the crystals are unaware they're being watched. Roll on the Dungeon Scenes table to determine what scene a crystal is depicting at any given time.

##### Dungeon Scenes
|  d4 | Scene                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  2  | An adventurer slowly reaches toward a lurid green sculpture of a yawning, fiendish face.                                                                                     |
|  3  | A bag-like monster that looks like an executioner's hood wraps around an adventurer's head. The adventurer struggles as they begin to suffocate.                             |
|  4  | An adventurer runs, holding an armful of jeweled sculptures that resemble various desserts. Behind them, a furious woman in crimson regalia screams, "Off with their heads!" |

***Dungeonland Results.*** It takes an hour for a game of Dungeonland to play out, after which the adventurers exploring the dungeon either escape or meet terrible ends. Roll on the Dungeonland Results table to determine how the game concludes.

*"You ever get the feeling you're being watched? Not by, like, something sinister, but by throngs of drinky, otherworldly weirdos. No? Me either."*Ã¢ÂÂ Aliss of Arabel, Dungeonland contestant
##### Dungeonland Results

|  10 | Adventurers Win. All the adventurers escape the dungeon.                                            |

The results of this roll can be influenced by submitting magic items at the betting booth.

![In Dungeonland, otherworldly gamblers bet on adventurers across the planes](img/adventure/ToFW/049-03-003.dungeonland.webp)

***Betting Booth.*** Knol Knockturn (neutral, tiefling **assassin**) runs the betting booth, a desk at the center of the island. Knol can explain the rules of Dungeonland and take any bets the characters place. The standard entry is 1 platinum chip with a bet on whether the adventurers will escape the dungeon. If a participant chooses correctly, they double their entry bet. If they bet wrong, they lose the chips they bet.

Knol places the chips bet in a plain-looking lockbox. Anything placed in box is teleported to Shemeshka's personal vault. He can also withdraw legitimately won winnings from the box.

***Magic Item Submissions.*** Knol also accepts magic items to be added to the dungeon, which can influence the game's results. A bettor can send a magic item to the dungeon. The magic item must be in the bettor's possession and be of at least uncommon rarity. Knol takes the item, then has an attendant magically deliver it into the dungeon, where it falls into the adventurers' hands. Once a magic item is delivered to the dungeon, it can't be returned. After the magic item is submitted, roll twice next time you roll on the Dungeonland Results table and use the higher result.

***Portal.*** This permanently open portal connects to *area P1*.

#### P3a: Supertemporal Arena Entrance

>>A sharp tiefling in a stylish gown stands behind a black podium in this stark, white room. On the wall behind her stands an archway filled with violet energy. A similar arch provides entry to this blank space.
>>

Amber Atwert (lawful evil, tiefling **assassin**) welcomes anyone who enters the room to the Supertemporal Arena. She explains that through the portal behind her, two unfathomably ancient beings are about to conclude an eons-long struggle: Bowolg the Cosmic Rot and Volsheez the Ever-Empty.

Amber notes that a character can place a bet of 1 platinum chip on either of these primordials. If the chosen primordial wins, the character wins 2 chips. If they choose the wrong primordial, the character loses their chip. If a character places a bet, Amber accepts it and invites them to pass through the portal to area P3b.

She can also explain everything in the "Time in the Arena" section of area P3b, but she doesn't volunteer this unless asked.

***Portals.*** The portal to the southwest leads to area P3b. The portal to the northeast connects to *area P1*.

#### P3b: Supertemporal Arena

>>All manner of strange immortals fill rows of seating inside a gigantic glass viewing sphere floating amid swirling energy. An unfathomable distance away, two incredible beings composed of stars and crackling magic are locked in the throes of a cosmos-shaking battle while the audience shouts and cheers. A single gate filled with violet light exits the orb.
>>

The Supertemporal Arena drifts at the edge of the Elemental Chaos in an infinity of dissipating energies.

***Time in the Arena.*** The arena moves rapidly through time. Every minute in the arena equals 100 years in Sigil. Any mortal creature in the arena ages 10 years every 6 seconds (1 round). If a creature in the arena ages past its maximum age (as determined by you), it is reduced to dust. Unless noted otherwise, a character's life expectancy is around 100 years. If a character is killed in this way, the multiversal glitch causes them to reappear somewhere out of the other characters' sight, such as *area P1*.

***Winning the Contest.*** There is a 50 percent chance for either Bowolg or Volsheez to win their ages-long battle, but which of these fantastically slow-moving entities will triumph won't be known for hundreds of years. In the sped-up time of the Supertemporal Arena, though, the battle plays out in 3d6 minutes. A creature needs to spend approximately 10 rounds (aging 100 years) to witness the end of the battle. On seeing the battle's end, a creature can use the gate to return to Fortune's Wheel and collect any winnings they've earned from Amber.

***Losing the Contest.*** If a character bets on the loser, the character can't place another bet until 24 hours later, after Shemeshka's agents have found another improbable event to witness using temporal hyper speed, like the deaths of stars or which gate-town will be consumed by a plane next.

***Portal.*** This passage travels through both space and time. Any creature that uses the portal returns to *area P3a* moments after they entered but aged by however long they spent in the arena.

#### P4: Fiend's Ante

>>A lone archway stands atop a cliff overlooking the scorched cities and scourged terrain of a war-wracked world. Nearby, a ring of onlookers keeps a wary distance from a massive, scaled devil and a fiery demon playing a game of cards. Thousands of stars in the night sky bear red or green nimbuses.
>>

Tiefling attendants moving amid the crowd can explain that the gamblers here are Vixsheer the **pit fiend** and Bholmaz the **balor**, two generals of fiendish armies locked in the eternal Blood War. The Fiends are indifferent to the characters and the nearby audience. On the table is a deck of indestructible iron playing cards and several hundred similarly indestructible iron tokens. In the skies above are thousands of stars magically limned in fiery red or crackling green auras.

The Fiends are playing a variation on the game three-dragon ante. The stakes are Material Plane worldsÃ¢ÂÂthose of the nimbus-marked stars. Every token corresponds to one of the worlds, and the token's bearer has the right to lead legions in conquest of that world. The stars glowing with red flames have invasion rights claimed by the Nine Hells' armies, while the stars with crackling green auras are claimed by the Abyss's hordes.

The world beyond the game table is a lifeless planet. It was once lush and populated, but it has been globally ravaged by the Blood War.

***Buying into the Game.*** A character can buy into the game with 1 platinum chip, which a tiefling attendant exchanges for several dozen iron tokens. Dozens of stars in the sky are then highlighted in a new color of the character's choice.

***Playing the Game.*** After every 10 minutes of playing, a character can make a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Wisdom (Insight) check. If they succeed, they double their number of tokens. If they fail, they lose half their tokens. If they fail twice, they lose all their tokens and are out of the game. While the table is large enough to keep a character playing the game away from Bholmaz's Fire Aura, Vixsheer's Fear Aura might affect them.

***Goading the Fiends.*** Any character can goad the Fiends into attacking each other by succeeding on three DC 16 Charisma (Deception) checks. These checks can be made once every 10 minutes during the game. A character doesn't need to be playing the game to goad the Fiends.

***Winning the Game.*** A character wins the game if they succeed on three checks to play the game. The Fiends might attack the character if the character has been rude or is obviously cheating. A character is also deemed the winner if the Fiends slay each other, or if the character is otherwise the only one remaining at the table. A character who wins the game can collect 3 platinum chips from a tiefling attendantÃ¢ÂÂeven if one of character's incarnations was slain by the FiendsÃ¢ÂÂalong with an infernal document noting their right to invade the worlds they won as part of the game.

***Portal.*** A permanent portal connects to *area P1*.

![Shemeshka's uniformed bodyguards, a maelephant and an eater of knowledge, defend the House of Liars](img/adventure/ToFW/050-03-004.bodyguards.webp)

#### P5: Shemeshka's Guard

Characters can only access this area if the portal here is activated, creating a connection with *area P1* (see the "*Guards*" section earlier in this chapter). On entering this area, read the following description:

>>Colorful silks and mosaic patterns cover the walls of this airy entry chamber. Several shallow alcoves line the room's perimeter, and to the north stands a platinum double door. At the center of the room, a crystal sphere hovers over an ornate, burbling fountain.
>>

This area serves as a guard post for Shemeshka's inner sanctum. If they haven't been dealt with already, two **warden archons** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) stand watch here and review scenes from elsewhere in the Platinum Rooms that flicker on the crystal sphere. The archons order anyone who clearly isn't in Shemeshka's employ to leave. They attack 1 round later, fighting to the death.

***Crystal Sphere.*** The crystal sphere shows scenes of *areas P1*Ã¢ÂÂ*P4*, scrying on them as if it were a *crystal ball of true seeing*. The scene in the sphere changes to a different scene every 10 seconds. If removed from where it hovers, the sphere functions as a normal *crystal ball*.

***Portal.*** A one-way portal here connects with area P1. It requires a powdered fox tooth to openÃ¢ÂÂboth archons here carry a vial of such powder. Once opened, the portal remains open for 10 minutes. See the "*Guards*" section earlier in this chapter for details on how to open this portal from area P1.

#### P6a: House of Liars

>>Faint music and sharp perfume drift on the breeze blowing amid the columns and alcoves of this lavish chamber. Gemstone mosaics and platinum gilding glimmer amid hanging silks and furnishings heaped with cushions. The eyes of dozens of vulpine visages, sculpted on columns and decorative statues, stare in your direction.
>>
>>Behind a narrow standing desk, a familiar, red-furred figure sighs and looks up from her work. "I've been expecting you," Shemeshka says, "but not quite so... still alive. I've never had gofers who've needed such convincing to just stay dead."
>>

**Shemeshka** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) wants the characters dead and gone. She calls on her two invisible bodyguards lurking in alcoves near the door: an **eater of knowledge** (that has consumed 5 brains) and a **maelephant** (see *Morte's Planar Parade* for both stat blocks). Shemeshka has dressed them in Fortune's Wheel uniforms and doused them in perfume. The bodyguards attack when called.

Shemeshka avoids battle, as she considers it beneath her. However, she won't retreat and uses defensive spells, her Teleport bonus action, and her Fell Counterspell reaction while she mocks intruders and uses her domain to act against foes (see below). Once her bodyguards are dispatched, Shemeshka calls for a truce (see "*What Shemeshka Really Knows*").

***Shemeshka's Domain.*** The House of Liars is among Shemeshka's favorite safe houses, a layer of the Abyss she conned away from its previous owner, the demon Alrunes. Shemeshka can will the semiliving domain to defend her. During any battle that takes place in area P6 while Shemeshka is present, roll on the House of Liars Defenses table each round at initiative count 0.

|  1  | Mocking Winds. A blast of powerful wind that sounds like Shemeshka's laughter fills the area for 1 round. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  2  | Razorvine Bloom. Razorvines burst from the floor. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in contact with the floor must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) slashing damage and has the restrained condition until the end of the next round. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.                                                                                   |
|  3  | Splendor. The area shimmers, and Shemeshka's visage appears in countless reflective surfaces. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by a *confusion* spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  4  | Crushing Will. Amid the sound of vulpine yips and growls, Shemeshka's will overwhelms the minds of intruders. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in the area must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10) psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack roll or saving throw before initiative count 0 on the next round. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. |

***Mosaics.*** The walls are covered in geometric patterns formed by gemstones. Each of the thousands of gems holds a tiny figure. These individuals are spies, scholars, and foes of Shemeshka whom the arcanaloth keeps bound using the Resplendent Cage (see *area P6b*).

***Treasure.*** A character who searches the room finds curios worth 15,000 gp, a *dagger of venom*, a suit of *demon armor*, and an *instrument of the bards (Anstruth harp)*, all designed with vulpine shapes.

*"As followers of the Soothing Spirit, never speak above a whisper, never wear orange, and never, ever mention the House of Liars."*Ã¢ÂÂ Precepts of the demon lord Alrunes, former ruler of the House of Liars
#### P6b: Resplendent Cage

>>A circular mosaic of tiles on this alcove's floor depicts tormented faces caged beneath a lattice of razorvines.
>>

Shemeshka uses this magical mosaic to lock away her foes and ensure certain secrets stay secret. Any creature with the incapacitated or restrained condition that spends 1 minute within the mosaic's circle is affected by the minimus containment effect of the *imprisonment* spell and is trapped within a randomly colored gemstone that appears on the floor of this area. Any gemstone created by the mosaic that is returned to this area for 1 minute shatters, ending the spell and releasing the creature imprisoned within. This would affect each of the gems in the mosaics in area P6a. The alcove can be used to imprison or free a creature 10 times every 24 hours.

The *detect magic* spell reveals that the mosaic sheds an aura of abjuration magic.

***Prisoners.*** Shemeshka tries to dissuade the characters from freeing random imprisoned creatures, many of which are evil or dangerous.

#### What Shemeshka Really Knows

Once Shemeshka's bodyguards are dispatched, she exasperatedly offers to tell the characters everything they want to know if they swear to leave and never bother her again. If they agree, she shares the following details:

- Each character independently ran afoul of Shemeshka some time ago. She was responsible for their deaths but, to her surprise, they returned.
- She has killed each character dozens of times, only to have them reappear. She finally trapped each using the Resplendent Cage (area P6b).
- The characters still returned, but they were diminished and had their memories fractured. She had her servants dump the characters at the Mortuary.
- When the characters appeared again, she sent them to find **R04M** in the hope they'd never return.
- Shemeshka still has imprisoned incarnations of the characters. She can retrieve them for the characters (a character who searches *area P6a* for 10 minutes also finds them).
- She believes that the characters' unique situation is a result of a planar imbalance caused by a group of modrons lost in the Outlands. She hopes that by manipulating the data these modrons record, she can profitably influence the workings of their home plane, Mechanus.
- Shemeshka corroborates everything **R04M** told the characters in *chapter 13*.

As soon as she has shared this information, or if she is forced into battle after relating this information, Shemeshka uses an *amulet of the planes* to escape. If she doesn't convey any of this information, the characters can learn it from meticulously kept documents stashed in Shemeshka's desk.

### Unity of Self

Each character has another incarnation of themself imprisoned in a gem amid the walls of Shemeshka's sanctuary. If these gems are found and placed in *area P6b*, the incarnations are freed, and the following things happen:

- **Lost and Found.** Each freed incarnation appears and then swiftly vanishes, dropping one or more magic items (see the "*Heroic Equipment*" section). The associated character receives a flood of sensations and their memories as this missing piece of themself returns. Among these are any other details about the character the player wants to be trueÃ¢ÂÂsuch as how the character ran afoul of Shemeshka (see the following section).
- **Incarnations Reunited.** Every player whose character's incarnation is freed must choose one of their character's incarnations or a new one they create now. This is now their one and only characterÃ¢ÂÂwho they truly are and have always been. The other incarnations aren't used again, and the details in the "*Glitch Characters*" section in the *introduction* no longer apply. Each character is now a regular character who lives and dies as normal.
- **Level Jump.** The character gains multiple levels, advancing to 17th level and remembering their former, more powerful self.

If a character doesn't release their lost incarnation, it might make the following chapter more challenging. Let each character decide what to do with their trapped incarnation. If they decide to release it later, they can do so by returning to the House of Liars or by magical means available in Sigil.

*"You never stop being a hero. You might take a break, you might settle down, you might even forget for a little while, but everything you've striven forÃ¢ÂÂall the ways you've worked to be greatÃ¢ÂÂnever really changes."*Ã¢ÂÂ Kheiron, hero trainer of Glorium
#### Returned Memories

When the characters' memories return, they're once again aware of the exploits of their 17th-level selves and how they ran afoul of Shemeshka's plots. Players can detail these memories however they please. They can fill in their characters' backgrounds all at once, or they can take time to process their characters' memories, recovering details a little at a timeÃ¢ÂÂpotentially over multiple sessions.

Use the following questions to help players detail their characters' pasts:

- Did others consider you a hero or a villain?
- For what accomplishment were you best known?
- Did you know any of the other characters?
- Did you have a home on the Material Plane, or did you travel many planes?
- What catastrophe or betrayal led to your demise?
- How do you know Shemeshka was involved in your downfall?

The characters' pasts don't have any bearing on the rest of this adventure, but use these details to inspire where the campaign leads next.

#### Heroic Equipment

Trapped with each incarnation in the House of Liars are magic items each character possessed when they were at the height of their power. Now that the characters have regained that power, their lost magic items return. Each player should choose one of the following options, then select magic items of these rarities from the *Dungeon Master's Guide*:

**Option A**: One magic item of legendary rarity

**Option B**: Two very rare magic items

**Option C**: Four magic items of rare or lesser rarity

As the DM, you must approve any magic items a player selects. Encourage any player who selects a *cubic gate* to make another choice (as one appears in the next chapter). Feel free to also exclude unique magic items, like the sword *Blackrazor*, or items you find disruptive, like the *deck of many things* or a *ring of three wishes*.

### Fate of the Multiverse

With their memories restored, the characters are whole once more. However, they're now aware that they're not the only victims of Shemeshka's schemes. How they might put an end to this interplanar disruption is detailed in the following chapter.

End this chapter with each player deciding which of their character's incarnations is their true self, and advancing the characters to 17th level as described above.

## Chapter 15: Echoes of Delusion

With their memories and capabilities restored, the characters are prepared to face any threat in the multiverse. The modron **R04M** has their first challenge in mind, though: freeing its lost modron brethren and putting an end to the disruption in the Outlands that caused the characters to become unmoored from reality.

After the characters leave the Platinum Rooms, where they go next is up to them. Shemeshka will avoid them for the rest of the adventure. To continue with this chapter, the group should meet with **R04M**, either by returning to the walking castle or by having the monodrone seek them out. There's no rush to move on with these events, though. Feel free to run other events inspired by *Sigil and the Outlands*.

![Modrons marching endlessly through Tyrant's Spiral pass the skull of the former archdevil Beherit... again](img/adventure/ToFW/051-03-005.tyrants-spiral.webp)

### Missing Modrons

When the characters meet with **R04M** again, the monodrone assesses that they can now do what it couldn't: correct the multiversal disruption that affected the party and caused other glitches across the Outlands. **R04M** provides the following information:

- **R04M** was part of the last Great Modron March. The contingent he belonged to became lost in the Outlands.
- **R04M** has deduced that the modrons are caught in the shifting realm of Gzemnid, a beholder god of deception, gases, and obscurement.
- Shemeshka discovered the modrons in Tyrant's Spiral, an ever-shifting part of Gzemnid's Realm. There she exposed the modrons to fiendish influences, convincing them the Outlands are overrun by evil beings.
- The modrons' belief is skewing the underpinnings of the Outlands and the planes beyond, creating multiversal anomalies.
- Shemeshka planned to eventually release the modrons to Mechanus, where they would skew the workings of that plane. She would then take advantage of the chaos.
- **R04M** wants the characters to go to Gzemnid's Realm; find the group's leader, the hexton modron called **X01**; and help the modrons escape.

**R04M** can also reiterate any details he provided in *chapter 13*. While the multiverse might contort to keep **R04M** alive, if the modron is dead, **Zaythir** can provide this information as the result of her studies and investigations into Shemeshka's dealings.

**R04M** notes that, as is customary in such dealings, he has compensation for the characters: a bag of gemstones the modron had stashed in the Outlands, valued at 15,013 gp. He will give the characters the bag if they help the modrons escape (see the "*Unity of Rings*" section later in this chapter for details). **R04M** can't haggle or offer any greater reward, but he can hypothesize on the dire ramifications of the modrons' long-term entrapment.

#### Back to the Outlands

Once the characters agree to aid **R04M**, they'll need to find a way to reach Gzemnid's Realm. **R04M** shares the location of the portal he originally used to escape into Sigil. This portal's location is up to you. Use this opportunity to return to a favorite site in the adventure or to help characters acclimate to their new powers. The **R04M**'s Portal table suggests a few locations for the gate to Gzemnid's Realm.

*"'Anything's possible!' That's what they say. And it's true! Absolutely anything. It's *all* possible. In the infinite infinities, whatever you can think of is out there. And if you think about it hard enough, it'll come thinking for you!"*Ã¢ÂÂ Iyaz Eyaz, Sigil philosopher

#### Phenomenal Power

The characters have gained considerable power since their last adventure, and the challenges in the following section will test that power. Consider giving characters an opportunity to familiarize themselves with their new powers. Unused portions of this adventure, *Sigil and the Outlands*, *Morte's Planar Parade*, or even another anthology of D&D adventures can provide level-appropriate threats. When the characters are ready, proceed with the following section.

### Tyrant's Spiral

The realm of the beholder deity Gzemnid lies beneath the Outlands. Most entrances into these mysterious, gas-filled caverns are found near chaotically aligned gate-townsÃ¢ÂÂlike Bedlam, Sylvania, or XaosÃ¢ÂÂbut Gzemnid's Realm is elusive, even by the mutable standards of the Outlands. The portion of the Great Modron March that **R04M** belonged to became lost in a magically shifting cave system known as Tyrant's Spiral. These gas-filled caverns change constantly, trapping the modrons in an ever-contorting circle that exposes them to the same grim visions over and over again.

#### Tyrant's Spiral Features

Tyrant's Spiral has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Unless noted otherwise, caverns have 30-foot-high ceilings.
- **Gaseous Light.** Harmless, luminous gases shed dim light throughout the caverns. Strong winds, such as those created by the *gust of wind* spell, cause the gases to dissipate for 5 minutes before they refresh. During this time, a cavern is dark.
- **Modron Tracks.** A rut of tracks marks the course of the lost, marching modrons. Any creature that enters this area on foot is affected as described in the "*Marching Modrons*" section.
- **Tyrant Fungus.** Beholder-like fungi cover the cavern walls. See the "Fungal Observers" section for details.
- **Planar Uncertainty.** Gzemnid veils his realm in uncertainty. Only portals and permanent teleportation circles allow reliable transportation into his realm.

#### Fungal Observers

Gzemnid's Realm is covered with fungal growths bristling with eyestalks and harmless maws. The beholder deity Gzemnid sees through these fungi and threatens intruders by whispering through countless lichenous mouths. This effect can't be dispelled. Improvise how the arrogant god comments on the characters' situation. Gzemnid always refers to itself in the third person. Examples of the beholder god's commentary are provided here:

**When a character misses with an attack.** "How can you expect to hit anything with so few eyes?"

**When a character takes damage.** "Cast away your disgusting limbs! Embrace Gzemnid's globular perfection!"

**When a character kills a monster.** "Unworthy, but we accept your offering!"

**When a character calls on the power of a deity or patron to cast a spell.** "You beg for power from a weakling! Their pathetic magic is nothing in my realm!"

#### Marching Modrons

Thousands of modrons march through the caves, unaware that they're traveling in an endless loop. The modrons are indifferent to other creatures and ignore creatures they trample or creatures that try to communicate. If faced with barriers, the modrons create simple structures (like bridges or towers) by linking their bodies or dig around impediments. No matter how many modrons are destroyed, more take their place.

Any non-modron that enters the path of the marching modrons on foot is trampled. The creature must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage and has the prone condition in the closest unoccupied space outside the modrons' path. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage but is otherwise affected the same.

Modrons are unaffected by the march and can move through it unimpeded.

#### Prepared for Power

Before running this part of the adventure, familiarize yourself with the characters' new class features. These powers should make the characters feel potent, but if you find the party overpowering encounters in this chapter, consider adding the following additional challenges after a round or two of combat:

- **Additional Foes.** If an encounter features several of the same creature, have one more of that creature or up to three **beholder zombies** (mindless, chanting followers of Gzemnid) appear after 2 rounds.
- **Gzemnid's Gaze.** One of Gzemnid's massive, aberrant eyes opens on the celling. It is a Huge object with AC 14, 60 hit points, and vulnerability to piercing damage. Every round at initiative count 0, the eye focuses on a different random character it can see. That character must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw, or the eye emits a ray that moves the character up to 30 feet in any directionÃ¢ÂÂtypically into pits, the path of the marching modrons, or other threats. The character has the restrained condition until initiative count 0 of the next turn or until the eye is destroyed.

#### Tyrant's Spiral Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 15.1. This map is divided into six smaller maps depicting sites along the modrons' endless march. The distance between areas varies from yards to miles. Feel free to add additional encounters between areas, to change their order, or to have the characters come across the same areas multiple times to reinforce the space's surreal nature.

![Map 15.1: Tyrant's Spiral](img/adventure/ToFW/052-map-03.02-tyrants-spiral.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/ToFW/053-map-03.02-tyrants-spiral-player.webp)
#### T1: Lair of the Eye

Read or paraphrase the following text when the characters first enter the area:

>>You arrive on a ledge overlooking a massive cavern. Behind you is an archway of fungal stalks covered in eyes and chattering teeth. Eerie clouds of thin vapor drift through the space, emanating from narrow cracks in the floor and several giant holes in the ceiling. Through the space echoes the clangor of thousands of metallic feet. Countless modrons follow a deliberate route through the cave. Each of the geometrically shaped beings scans the strange terrain around them before vanishing into tunnels ahead.
>>

The characters arrive on a ledge overlooking the path taken by the modrons trapped in Tyrant's Spiral. The arch here is a duplicate of the portal the characters used to reach Tyrant's Spiral and connects to where they came from. A 50-foot, sheer cliff drops from the ledge to the cavern floor. The cracks in the floor and holes in the ceiling are winding and stretch endlessly through the depths.

- **Mummified Beholder.** Soon after the characters arrive, a withered **beholder** called Xabash floats into view and greets them. Xabash has an Intelligence of 6, is indifferent to the characters, and is highly forgetful. In a dreamy voice, Xabash asks if the characters are here to put an end to the bothersome noise (the marching modrons) or to ascend in Gzemnid's gaze. The beholder nods with a dull, fanatical gaze no matter how the characters respond. Xabash can provide general details from the "*Tyrant's Spiral*" section earlier in this chapter. Once the characters are done conversing with Xabash or if they attack it, the beholder drifts below one of the holes in the ceiling near the room's center (see the following section).

***Stalks of Gzemnid.*** Soon after the characters enter the area, an ancient beholder drifts under one of the holes in the room's ceiling, then rasps, "Great Gzemnid! See me clearly!" This might be Xabash or another beholder if Xabash was destroyed. A round later, the earth shakes, and a gigantic beholder eyestalk bursts from above. This **giant eyestalk** uses the **purple worm** stat block, but instead of Tail Stinger, it has the following action:

>>***Eradication Gaze (Recharge 5Ã¢ÂÂ6).*** The eyestalk creates an area of magical devastation in a 150-foot cone. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine violet dust.

The eyestalks can bite with fang-like lashes and swallow creatures in its massive pupil.

The stalk devours the ancient beholder and then attacks the characters. If Gzemnid hasn't already spoken to the characters (see the "*Fungal Observers*" section), it does so now, decrying them as "more trespassers," "motes in Gzemnid's divine sight," and "vexingly asymmetrical!"

On the second round of combat, a second eyestalk emerges from the hole in the ceiling. Once reduced to 0 hit points, these eyestalks eject any swallowed creatures, retract into their holes, and don't appear again.

![Modrons trample the endlessly regenerating remains of the demon Arlgolcheir](img/adventure/ToFW/054-03-006.modrons.webp)

#### T2: Beherit's Head

>>The modrons' path continues, leading past a many-horned skull impaled on a moldy stalagmite. Many of the clockwork beings flinch away from the sinister remains as they pass.
>>

The skull belongs to Beherit, a deposed archdevil who ruled the layer of Malbolge in the Nine Hells. It was placed here by Shemeshka's servants to influence the modrons. Although the archdevil is dead, a vestige of its evil remains in its 3-foot-diameter, horned skull. The skull has the following properties:

- Beherit's skull is sapient and lawful evil, having an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision within a range of 120 feet.
- The skull can speak Common and Infernal, and it can communicate with any creature within 10 feet of itself telepathically. Its voice is a hissing whisper. It reveals that it can communicate only to a single creature at a time.
- The skull can cast the *dominate monster* spell (save DC 20) three times per day. It orders charmed creatures to free it, carry it to the Nine Hells, and slay any creature that impedes this. The modrons marching through the caverns are immune to the skull's domination.
- The skull is impervious to damage.

Beherit's skull can be removed from its stalagmite. The skull seeks to restore itself to life, which it believes it can do only in the Nine Hells. If the characters negotiate with the skull, it offers to aid their escape if they promise to return it to the Nine Hells. It knows that somewhere in Tyrant's Spiral is the maw of the beholder god Gzemnid, which has the power to create a portal out of the misty caverns.

#### T3: Ocular Space

>>Billowing magenta fog swirls over the crumbling cavern floor. The modrons march up a narrow ramp, as the rest of the cave falls away into a bottomless pit. Giant rocks sculpted with massive, beholder-like faces float amid the gas, their surfaces bristling with attentive, fungal eye stalks.
>>

The rocks floating in this room are the petrified corpses of long-dead beholder demigods. Creatures can leap between two floating rocks by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that succeeds on three of these checks can climb from the area's northern entrance to the eastern exit. A creature that fails one of these checks falls into the pit below (see the "Pit" section below).

A rock at the northeast edge of the area has a yawning mouth. This mouth holds a portal that opens near the gate-town of *Hopeless*. To open, the portal requires a freshly cried tearÃ¢ÂÂa fact characters might learn in *area T4*.

***Beholders.*** Two **beholders** drift amid the floating rocks. They ignore the modrons but attack any other creature that moves amid the rocks. The beholders fight to the death while arguing between themselves whether to devour or to petrify the interlopers.

***Pit.*** The pit is bottomless. Any creature that falls into it plummets for over 200 feet before landing on a ledge and taking 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Treasure.*** An *Ioun stone (mastery)* is loosely embedded in the sculpted eye of one of the rocks floating over the pit. The first character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher who comes within 5 feet of the rocks, or who checks the rocks with a *detect magic* spell, notices the gem.

#### T4: Arlgolcheir's Morass

>>A fetid stench accompanies the sound of the marching modrons trudging through sucking mud. Thick black sludge covers the floor of the cavern ahead.
>>

The ooze is all that remains of the semidead demon lord Arlgolcheir, a Fiend Shemeshka freed from an Abyssal prison and deposited here to terrorize the modrons. The muck has the following properties:

- The ooze is sentient and chaotic evil, having an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 22, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision within a range of 120 feet.
- It can speak Common and Abyssal. Its voice is a halting rasp that chokes frequently.
- When a creature enters the area covered in ooze for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 55 (10d10) acid damage and have the restrained condition. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Arlgolcheir can choose not to restrain a creature.
- The ooze regenerates rapidly, making it effectively impervious to damage.

Arlgolcheir seeks to reassume its demonic form and escape Gzemnid's Realm. It is being trampled by the modrons, which prevents it from restoring itself. The demon lord tries to convince the characters to halt the modrons trampling it. If the characters can stop or reroute the modrons for 3 rounds, Arlgolcheir changes into a version of its true form, that of a constantly rotting and re-forming corpse with shifting features (chaotic evil; use the **lich** stat block). It revels in its freedom and shares anything it knows with those who free it, such as details of the portal in *area T3* and how to activate it. After this, Arlgolcheir is quick to turn on the characters.

#### T5: Gzemnid's Maw

>>Along the edge of a ravine, fungal clusters grow in ten-foot-tall stalks crowned by gigantic eyes. Below, rows of spear-length teeth bristle within the ravine, forming a gigantic, monstrous maw. Gases billow in and out of the crag in massive breaths.
>>
>>The modrons continue their march over this impossible mouth, crossing it by creating a bridge made from interlocked, living modron bodies.
>>

The beholder god Gzemnid can see through this area's eyestalks and speak from the depths. Gzemnid encourages creatures to leap into its mouth or to destroy the modron bridge and send it toppling into its maw.

Any creature that falls into Gzemnid's maw plummets 200 feet before passing through a shimmering black veil, which obliterates the creature and leaves no remains.

***Modron Bridge.*** Hundreds of modrons form the bridge that spans the ravine while other modrons cross along their backs. These modrons don't defend themselves, but three **nonaton modrons** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) emerge from the marching throng and engage any creature that attacks the bridge. These nonatons fight to the death. If the nonatons are defeated, three more nonatons arrive to defend the bridge after 1 minute.

***Damaging the Bridge.*** Treat the modrons at the base of each side of the bridge as a Large object with AC 14 and 40 hit points. If destroyed, hundreds of modrons plummet into Gzemnid's maw, and the march halts for 5 minutes as more modrons pile atop one another to create a new bridge.

***Outlands Portal.*** In addition to being a destructive rift, Gzemnid's maw is also a gigantic portal controlled by the beholder god itself. If Gzemnid can be convinced to open the portal and suppress the rift, the portal opens to a ravine near the gate-town of Xaos, and matter that passes through isn't destroyed. See "*Escaping Tyrant's Spiral*" later in this chapter for details on using this portal.

#### T6: X01's Throng

>>Ahead marches a cluster of modrons. Among them, a quartet of powerful, gear-studded individuals hoist a unique-looking modron on their shoulders. This singular, elaborately constructed modronÃ¢ÂÂa hulking creature with a single prominent eyeÃ¢ÂÂlooks damaged. Nevertheless, flickering green light shines from its eye, scanning the foggy cavern around it.
>>

Four **septon modrons** carry their fallen leader, the **hexton modron** **X01** (see *Morte's Planar Parade* for both stat blocks). Three septons attack any non-modron that comes within 10 feet of them and any creature that tries to interfere with **X01**. The remaining septon continues to carry **X01**, attacking only if **X01** is stolen. The septons fight to the death.

Septons carrying **X01** move with the other modrons at a rate of 20 feet per round. The septons drop their leader only if they have the incapacitated condition or take 30 or more damage from a single attack.

***X01.*** The modrons' leader has full hit points and the paralyzed condition. **X01** can be interacted with only if it is separated from its septon bearers and moved away from the marching modrons. If the characters move **X01** away and attempt to repair or otherwise interact with it, see the following section.

### Bad Data

The modron leader **X01** isn't just damagedÃ¢ÂÂits mind has been overwhelmed. This is a result of flawed orders **X01** received when it left Mechanus during the last Great Modron March, but more so because the misinformation it gathered in Tyrant's Spiral has skewed its understanding of the Outlands. **X01** and the modrons it leads now believe the Outlands are overrun with fiendish horrors and that the gears of Mechanus require major readjustments to restore balance to the planes.

#### Investigating X01

A character who spends 1 minute investigating **X01** finds a panel on the modron's head leaking green vapor. If the panel is opened or **X01** is deliberately damaged, read the following:

>>The modron jolts up and, with a voice like a klaxon, shouts, "Wrong! All wrong! Outlands: overrun! Great Wheel: at risk! Advisement: full planar realignment! Highest alert!" The modron continues issuing such dire reports. As it does, wisps of green vapor leak from its mouth, eyes, and seams. Gradually this vapor congeals into a nightmarish depiction of the Spire and the surrounding Outlands.
>>

The character with the highest Intelligence who witnesses this realizes the congealing vapor is **X01**'s interpretation of the Outlands, one overrun with evil Fiends. This becomes clear a moment later when **X01**'s shouting escalates. Proceed with the following section.

#### Corrupted Data

>>The modron's shouting becomes a screech of panicked static, and the image of the Outlands shudders and roars. It undergoes a terrifying transformation, blooming into a multilimbed, mechanized terror with a single, baleful eye that turns in your direction.
>>

The modrons' belief that the Outlands have been corrupted are so strong that they've shaken the underpinnings of the plane. Now these mistaken beliefs manifest as a **planar incarnate** (see *Morte's Planar Parade*) of a plane that doesn't exist: a Fiend-overrun version of the Outlands (use the planar incarnate's Fiend form). The planar incarnate is hostile toward non-modrons. The round after appearing, it attacks the characters and fights until destroyed.

***Replacement Data.*** As the planar incarnate is a manifestation of **X01**'s beliefs, those beliefs can be undermined. A character can present to **X01** evidence that the Outlands aren't overrun by Fiends, such as mementos they picked up in the gate-towns or recordings from the Mosaic Mimir. If a character uses an action to present such information and succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the planar incarnate has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of the character's next turn.

#### Lost Data

Once the planar incarnate is destroyed, **X01** collapses. A character with proficiency in Intelligence (Arcana or Medicine) can tell the following:

- **X01** is alive, but its mind is vacant.
- To reactivate, **X01** would need to recover its knowledge about the planes.

The Mosaic Mimir has the information **X01** needs to reactivate. The characters might come to this conclusion on their own, or a character who investigates **X01**'s body might realize that within the damaged panel is enough room for the *mimir*. If a character inserts the *mimir* into **X01**, the hexton reactivates a moment later. This has multiple effects, which are summarized in the following sections.

![The distorted beliefs of the hexton modron {@creature X01|ToFW} and its wayward followers manifest as a godlike incarnation of a nonexistent realm](img/adventure/ToFW/055-03-007.modron-corruption.webp)

### Reactivating X01

![In one possible reality, modrons enter the fray in the endless Blood War between demons and devils](img/adventure/ToFW/056-03-008.blood.war.webp)

Should the characters reactivate **X01** by embedding their *mimir* in the modron leader, **X01**'s perspective on the Outlands shifts. This view rapidly disseminates among the other modrons trapped in Tyrant's Spiral. What this perspective is depends on what information the characters recorded in their *mimir* during *part 2* and whether their reports on the Outlands were accurate, inconsistent, or skewed. Consult the Mimir Restoration Tracker from *chapter 4*, and choose which of the following sections best matches the information the character recorded in their *mimir*. Each entry details the data's effects on **X01**'s personality and has ramifications in the "*Conclusion*" section.

#### Accurate

If the characters' *mimir* largely details the Outlands in an unbiased way, **X01** realizes reality is behaving within expected parameters. It reactivates as a calm, logical modron that is eager to lead its followers directly to Mechanus, where they can make an unremarkable report.

#### Inconsistent

If the characters provided inconsistent details about the OutlandsÃ¢ÂÂseveral accurate and several skewedÃ¢ÂÂ**X01** reactivates and exhibits dramatic mood swings. It seeks to lead the modrons to its home plane, but it is uncertain where that is.

#### Skewed

If the characters' reports on the Outlands reflect their bias for a particular philosophy or alignment, the modrons act in opposition. The Skewed Data Results table notes **X01**'s personality after being influenced by data skewed along the lines of particular alignments. If the information characters provided to their *mimir* strongly reflects the philosophies of a faction in Sigil, choose the result that best corresponds with that faction's agenda.

##### Skewed Data Results
| Data Skewed | X01's Personality                                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chaotic     | Rigid, even for a modron, and insistent that the characters aid it in returning to Mechanus |
| Evil        | Serene and overly concerned about the characters' safety                                    |
| Good        | Manipulative and eager to abandon the characters and the other modrons after it escapes     |
| Lawful      | Distractable and prone to recklessness                                                      |

### Escaping Tyrant's Spiral

If **X01** is reactivated, the modron wants to escape Tyrant's Spiral, but it doesn't know about the portals in the nearby areas. Characters might use the methods here to help the modrons escape.

#### Portal to Hopeless

The portal to *Hopeless* in *area T3* is narrow and a challenge for the modrons to reach. It will take days for all the modrons to pass through, and likely many portal-key tears to keep the portal open. **Beholders** also frequent this area and try to pick off modrons as they escape.

#### Portal to Sigil

The portal in *area T1*, which the characters used to enter Tyrant's Spiral, still functions. However, like the portal to Hopeless, it is difficult to reach. Additionally, unleashing thousands of modrons on Sigil is dangerous. Should this happen, the Lady of Pain intervenes quickly and, through a **dabus**, informs the characters they have 10 minutes to set things right. How the characters can reconcile thisÃ¢ÂÂand avoid the MazesÃ¢ÂÂis up to you.

#### Portal to Xaos

The portal in *area T5* opens only when Gzemnid pleases. Characters can convince the beholder god to let the modrons pass, but Gzemnid demands to consume half the modrons first. A character can convince Gzemnid to eat only a quarter of the modrons by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or they might bribe Gzemnid with the promise of bringing it a more tempting mealÃ¢ÂÂfor example, it has always wanted to eat a dragon or another god.

#### Remarkable Escape

It would take hundreds of castings of spells like *gate* or *teleportation circle* to relocate all the modrons. You might allow the characters to develop outlandish schemes or entreat otherworldly beings to help the modrons escape. Debts and ramifications accrued here can provide springboards to future adventures.

#### Abandonment or Sacrifice

The characters can leave the modrons in Tyrant's Spiral, but eventually Shemeshka or another being will manipulate the modrons to their own ends. If the characters try to destroy the modrons en masse, **X01** commands the modrons to defend themselves. Although annihilating the modrons would maintain the equilibrium of the planes, doing so might have ramifications on characters' alignments.

## Conclusion

If the characters release **X01** and the modrons from Tyrant's Spiral, their work for **R04M** is complete, but the ramifications for the multiverse might be dire.

### Realigning the Multiverse

How the characters contend with the lost modrons has far-rippling effects on the multiverse. The data from the characters' *mimir* affects not just **X01**'s perspective but also those of thousands of modrons. If the modrons return home, this data influences the cosmic alignment of Mechanus. Countless modrons across the multiverse then seek to rebalance the planes in accordance with the new arrangement of the plane of absolute law.

Depending on how the characters' *mimir* affected the liberated modrons, the axiomatic beings affect the multiverse in one of the following ways. Choose whichever one corresponds with the result from the "*Reactivating X01*" section. This determines how the characters' actions and the released modrons affect the planes.

#### Accurate

On returning to their home plane, the modrons report their data, which results in incremental refinements to Mechanus's workings. No precipitable changes to the status quo of the multiverse occur. No other creatures suffer the multiversal glitch the characters experienced.

#### Inconsistent

Unless the characters intervene, it takes months for **X01** and a much-diminished group of modrons to return to Mechanus. When they do, chaos ensues. Modrons behave strangely across the planes, and chaotic creatures like slaadi operate unopposed. Numerous creatures experience the multiversal glitch that affected the characters. Ultimately, the modron leader, Primus, initiates a new Great Modron March to correct the chaos sweeping the planes.

#### Skewed

On the modrons' return to Mechanus, the skewed data in the characters' *mimir* causes all modrons across the planes to react differently toward different philosophies or types of beings. The Multiversal Effects of Skewed Data table summarizes the new behavior of the vast majority of modrons.

##### Multiversal Effects of Skewed Data
| Data Skewed | Multiversal Effects                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chaotic     | Modrons more vigorously oppose chaotic beings; modrons become more hostile against chaotic beings and expressions of lawlessness. |
| Evil        | Modrons oppose evil beings; Celestials ally with modrons to crusade against evil across the planes.                               |
| Good        | Modrons oppose good beings; Fiends manipulate modrons to besiege bastions of good across the planes.                              |
| Lawful      | Modrons withdraw to Mechanus; chaotic beings act unopposed across the planes.                                                     |

### Unity of Rings

Once the characters have dealt with the modrons and escaped Tyrant's Spiral, they're free to go where they please. If they find themselves in the Outlands and seek to return to Sigil, they can find a portal to the city near the closest gate-town. This portal opens within sight of the Mortuary.

Back in Sigil, the characters might seek out any of the following parties.

#### Farrow or Other Sigil Contacts

**Farrow** or another Sigil-based ally is glad to hear the characters resolved the strangeness plaguing them. The ally is well connected and know others who need accomplished adventurers. The ally also knows of useful portals, including those to Material Plane worlds the characters might hail from. Use this ally to lead the characters to future adventures.

#### R04M

Depending on how the characters resolved the situation in Tyrant's Spiral, **R04M** might be pleased or horrified. Nevertheless, if the characters helped any of the modrons escape, **R04M** rewards them with the promised gems. This includes gems worth 15,013 gp as well as an *elemental gem (emerald)* and a resin-encrusted *ring of regeneration*.

If the modron remains on good terms with the characters, **R04M** might seek to join them and see more of the multiverse. Or, if the characters have skewed the planes in some way, **R04M** might seek to set things right, perhaps by pursuing multiversal secrets within the Spire.

#### Shemeshka

The arcanaloth is frustrated by the characters' interfering with her plot and avoids them for a time, but she isn't one to let annoyance get in the way of opportunity. Shemeshka might eventually contact the characters to involve them in future schemes.

Shemeshka might contact the characters sooner if the data in their *mimir* skewed toward evil, as it's possible the characters produced the results she was seeking. If they did, the arcanaloth enjoys increased business selling weapons to demons, devils, and modrons embroiled in the Blood War. Shemeshka sends the characters polite thank-you notes, each with a complimentary platinum casino chip and an invitation to visit Fortune's Wheel anytime.

#### Sigil Factions

A character who reports their exploits to a Sigil faction they're a member of gains the attention of their faction's leaders. If the characters' *mimir* changed the multiverse in a way that their faction is in favor of or opposed to, a character's faction leader might have work for the party, either capitalizing on changes to reality or seeking to set things right.

### The Lady's Gift

After the characters have attended to any immediate business in Sigil, read or paraphrase the following text when next they're traveling together in the city:

>>It's unclear when or how it happened, but the street around you is empty and still. Before you can ponder the cosmically infinitesimal chances of a Sigil street emptying, a somber, gray-skinned figure floats into your path. The dabus hovers silently as a string of illusory images fade in to view around it. Prominent among these symbols is the razored image of the Lady of Pain.
>>

The first character to succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check deciphers the dabus's message. It reads as follows:

>>The Lady saw what you did. She has a message: stay out of trouble.
>>

Once the message is deciphered, the dabus points at the door of an empty building nearby and then floats away. If a character opens the door, read or paraphrase the following text:

>>The rickety plank door opens easily, revealing a wall of crusty bricks and gnarled razorvine. Embedded at the wall's center is a perfectly square, metallic brick with a faintly glowing towerlike rune on its surface.
>>

The glowing brick is a *cubic gate*, which slips from the wall effortlessly. The magic item is keyed to this door in Sigil, a door in the characters' walking castle on the Outlands, a world on the Material Plane, and three other planes of your choice.

As the cube is removed, the brick wall transforms into the glowing arch of an active portal that leads anywhere you choose.

The adventure ends here, with the characters on the threshold of the multiverseÃ¢ÂÂa place every bit as unpredictable and dangerous as it has always been.

*"What happens next? Just see where your imagination leads. I find that's where all good things start."*Ã¢ÂÂ Adahn, newly arrived resident of Sigil
