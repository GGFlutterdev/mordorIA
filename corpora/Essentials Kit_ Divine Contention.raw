# Introduction

![{@creature Ebondeath|DC}'s Lair](img/adventure/DC/000-hf9lp-ebondeaths-lair.webp)

*Divine Contention* is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for characters of 11th through 12th level set in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. By the end of the adventure the characters should reach 13th level. You can run the adventure for as few as one player or as many as six players.

You can run *Divine Contention* as a stand-alone adventure or as the concluding part in a trilogy called *Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak* (of which *Storm Lord's Wrath* is the first adventure and *Sleeping Dragon's Wake* is the second). This adventure trilogy can be played as a sequel to *Dragon of Icespire Peak*, the adventure that comes with the *D&D Essentials Kit*.

## Running the Adventure

To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks: the *Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*. The *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide* is helpful but not necessary.

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in *appendix A*. When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the *Monster Manual*, unless the adventure's text instead refers you to the monster appendix in this adventure.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

>>At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that's meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to the players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes like this one. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe locations or present bits of scripted dialogue.

## Running for One Player

If you're running this adventure for a single player, you can give that player a sidekick as a secondary character. Let the player choose one of the pregenerated sidekicks that come with this adventure. If a sidekick is lost or no longer needed, the player character can return to Leilon and acquire a new one.

### Using Sidekicks

Make sure the player understands the roles and limitations of sidekicks in this adventure:

- Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.
- Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.

![Map 1: The Sword Coast](img/adventure/DC/001-map-sc.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/DC/002-wnecz-map-sword-coast-pc.webp)
### Conyberry

The Triboar Trail runs right through this abandoned town, which was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins.

### Crags

These rocky, windswept hills are dotted with old mines that have become infested with monsters.

### High Road

This highway hugs the coast, connecting Neverwinter to the coastal cities of Luskan to the north and Waterdeep to the south. For years, the stretch of road south of Neverwinter fell into disuse because of frequent monster attacks. Recently, efforts have been made to keep the road safe, with light patrols of guards on horseback moving between Neverwinter and Leilon.

### Kryptgarden Forest

This ancient forest tucked behind the Sword Mountains contains the ruins of bygone dwarven civilizations. The abandoned lair of the green dragon Claugiyliamatar, nicknamed the Old Gnawbone, is found in these woods. During *Sleeping Dragons Wake*, **Claugiyliamatar** was possessed by the wraith of the ancient dracolich Chardansearavitriol, also known as **Ebondeath**, which now loyally serves the worshipers of Myrkul (see "Mere of Dead Men").

### Leilon

This small town along the High Road has just rebuilt itself after being abandoned for years. It serves as the starting location for the adventure. For more information, see "*Welcome to Leilon*."

### Mere of Dead Men

Travelers on the High Road, which skirts the mere to the east, must resist being lured into the cold and desolate waters. Many have perished in the mere, drawn by tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire. The Mere of Dead Men contains the tomb of the dracolich Chardansearavitriol, which is now the headquarters of the cult of Myrkul. For more information on this location, see "*Ebondeath's Mausoleum*."

### Neverwinter

This city was badly damaged when Mount Hotenow erupted some fifty years ago. Now, the City of Skilled Hands works to rebuild under the watchful eye of its Lord Protector, Dagult Neverember, who rules in the absence of an heir to Neverwinter's crown. At present, no legitimate heirs to the old Alagondar royal line are known to exist, and many believe that the line is ended. Lord Neverember, taking no chances, quietly pays off or disposes of anyone claiming a connection to the rulers of old.

### Neverwinter Wood

The forest east of Neverwinter seems to have a magical quality about it, or at least an air of mystical secrecy. Reclusive spellcasters are rumored to dwell deep within.

### Phandalin

Nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, Phandalin is a sleepy mining settlement that recently had dealings with a white dragon named Cryovain. The dragon was dispatched by a group of adventurers. For more information, see *Dragon of Icespire Peak* in the *D&D Essentials Kit*.

### Starmetal Hills

This range of rocky knolls is so named because the area has been the impact site of several meteor showers over millennia. The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.

### Sword Mountains

These steep, craggy, snow-capped mountains are home to scattered tribes of orcs as well as many monsters. Icespire Peak is the tallest among them. Their foothills are strewn with the ruins of bygone kingdoms, and more than a few half-forgotten dungeons and tombs.

### Triboar Trail

This path south of Neverwinter Wood is the safest route between Neverwinter and the town of Triboar, located in the Dessarin Valley to the east. The trail is not patrolled, and monster attacks are commonplace.

## The Adventure Begins

The adventure begins in the town of Leilon, which has been recently reconstructed after being abandoned for many years. The characters can receive quests, choose which ones to pursue, and experience encounters in Leilon. While Leilon is described in *Storm Lord's Wrath* and *Sleeping Dragon's Wake*, the settlers from Neverwinter have now finished their reconstruction of the town, adding new locations the characters can visit.

The "Adventure Background" section describes the events leading up to the adventure and the main threats the characters will face. The "Welcome to Leilon" and "Exploring Leilon" sections describe the town where the adventure begins. Knowing Leilon well ensures a smooth start to the adventure.

### Adventure Background

The ruined town of Leilon was once a fortified settlement on the High Road midway between the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep. The Lord Protector of Neverwinter, Dagult Neverember, hired a group of his citizens to rebuild the town, a construction project that has recently completed. They hope to create a fortified waypoint for travelers and merchants that can ward off the threats of the surrounding wilderness.

Two forces of evil are on the rise nearby, eager to control the region around Leilon and eventually the Sword Coast for themselves. The first is a cult of Talos, god of storms, led by their champion Fheralai Stormsworm. The cult's headquarters are inside a death knight dreadnaught, an undead galleon, which prowls the coast looking for trade ships to plunder.

Ularan Mortus, a priest of Myrkul, god of death, and his followers are raising an army of undead to lay siege to the city of Neverwinter. The spirit of the dead black dragon Chardansearavitriol, known also as **Ebondeath**, has recently allied with Ularan Mortus to steal a mythical artifact called the *ruinstone* from a tower inside Leilon.

The people of Leilon have just begun to uncover the threats both groups pose to the region. They need the help of adventurers if they want their rebuilt settlement to survive the danger.

### Upcoming Threats

Visitors to Leilon soon learn the following troubling rumors. Ensure your players are briefed on these threats before they choose quests from the quest board.

- Two rival cults, worshipers of Talos, god of storms, and Myrkul, god of death, are clashing in the wilds outside town.
- If Fheralai Stormsworn died during Sleeping Dragon's Wake, word reaches town that Talos has raised her from the dead.
- It is said that Myrkul has also performed a miracle to grant Ularan Mortus an undead army.
- The town council believes that the cultists are plotting to invade Leilon in order to seize control of the High Road.

> ##### Divine Contention as a Stand-Alone
>
>Some sections of this adventure reference *Storm Lord's Wrath* and *Sleeping Dragons Wake*, which can be run as prequels to *Divine Contention*. If you run *Divine Contention* as a stand-alone adventure, you can ignore the references to the other adventures, since all the information you need to run *Divine Contention* is contained in the "Adventure Background" section.

# Welcome to Leilon

Leilon was once a mining town that sold copper, nickel, and silver to Waterdeep. It was also a small port where merchants sometimes offloaded goods on barges (since most proper ships cannot traverse the town's shallow mud flats) to be transported to cities all over the Sword Coast.

Two hundred years ago, the wizard Thalivar made his home here and raised a tower at the town center to conduct his mystical studies. The House of Thalivar was topped with a planar beacon that lured creatures from other planes into the structure and trapped them there. After Thalivar mysteriously disappeared, the people of Leilon were content to leave his tower and the monsters within alone.

The Spellplague, a divine phenomenon that twisted FaerÃÂ»n's magic, corrupted the tower's defenses. The creatures sealed within were freed to attack Leilon, and the magic of the planar beacon was redirected back into the Material Plane, causing humanoids who looked upon it to become paralyzed. Leilon was quickly overrun and subsequently abandoned and has remained that way for more than a century.

The first action the soldiery of Neverwinter took in Leilon was to destroy the planar beacon inside the House of Thalivar. The mage Gallio Elibro has now rebuilt the beacon and begun his own studies into the Ethereal Plane. See "*Thalivar's Beacon*" for more information.

Before its fall, Leilon was defended by a loosely organized group of adventurers called the Swords of Leilon. When the House of Thalivar released its monsters, the Swords fought to cover the escape of the townsfolk. They died and became ghosts bound to Leilon's ruins. They now watch the rebuilding of the town with caution, hoping that the reconstructed tower does not bring similar disaster.

When you are ready for the adventure to get underway, show the Leilon map to the players and read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The palisade of Leilon forms a semicircle on the northeastern side of the town, defended by an earthen rampart. To the southwest, docks line the shore of the mere, packed with barges ready to cross the marsh and meet merchant ships at sea.
>>
>>Newly built houses with thatched roofs line Leilon's muddy streets. At the center of it all, the House of Thalivar, a tall wizard's tower, rises like a beacon, four times the height of every other building. The town below is bustling with merchants, workers, and adventurers-for-hire.
>>
>>Visitors with coin to spend are welcome in Leilon, and adventurers are the settlers' favorites. For while there is much work to be done within the town, there are deeds to be done outside as told by notices on the job board at the fishery.
>>

When the adventurers are ready to inspect the job board, proceed to the "Fishery" section.

![Map 2: Leilon Town](img/adventure/DC/003-wjwlc-map-leilon-town-map_dm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/DC/004-qfdcj-map-leilon-town-map_player.webp)
## Exploring Leilon

The characters might wish to explore key establishments within Leilon. These locations are marked on the map of Leilon.

### Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe

This shop is crammed with curiosities dredged from the ruins of Leilon: old fishing rods, swamp idols, mining helmets, and other oddities. A whimsical Illuskan human male named Aubrey Silverspun runs the store. Roll a d20 on Peculiarities table to see what he has on offer when the characters visit.

##### Peculiarities
|  d20  | Pecularity                      |  Price |
|:-----:|---------------------------------|-------:|
|  1-5  | Random Magic Item (Table C)     | 500 gp |
|  6-10 | Random *Trinket*                |  10 gp |
| 11-20 | Unique tool kit (engraved, etc) |  50 gp |

A painted tryptic above the counter shows three adventurers: a dark-skinned warrior woman, a red-bearded dwarf, and a third whose portrait has faded with age. Aubrey explains that these are the "Swords of Leilon": an old adventuring company local to the area.

### Barge Yard

Six mud-covered barges are chained together and beached at the edge of Leilon where the town meets the marsh. The barge master is a gruff elderly female dwarf named Rorsta Anvilhand. She rents a barge for a tenday for 10 gp.

### Fishery

The fishery building serves as the town hall. During the day the warehouse hosts several fishing-folk selling their daily catches at stalls and merchants who sell and repair fishing equipment. At night Leilon's town council gathers within to discuss the business of the town and active threats in the region. The councilors include:

***Grizzelda Copperwraught.*** Lord Neverember tasked this gruff female dwarf with overseeing Leilon's construction work.Now the job is done, some folk whisper that "The Growler" should step down from the council, yet nobody dares say that to her face.

***Sergeant Hazz Yorrum.*** This slovenly male Damaran human oversees Neverwinter's soldiers but defers to the town wizard Gallio Elibro for most decisions.

***Merrygold Brightshine.*** This amiable male halfling is the local priest of Lanthander, god of light. Merrygold helped found the town following its reconstruction and is loved by its people.

***Valdi Estapaar.*** Lord Neverember gave this half-elf female the job of overseeing the town's fishing industry. With the recent opening of the quayside, she's now one of the most important figures in town.

***Vangol Kuskolt.*** This fiery male dwarf priest stands for Tyr, god of justice, and adjudicates most legal disputes in the town.

A job board outside of the fishery holds notices for adventurers looking for work. If the characters inspect the job board, proceed to the "The Quest Board" section.

### House of Thalivar

This wizard's tower has been recently rebuilt as a garrison for the Neverwinter soldiery. Gallio Elibro is a brooding middle-aged male Rashemi human with the **mage** statistics (except that he has the *legend lore* spell prepared instead of *cone of cold*). He came to Neverwinter to find and unlock the secrets of the House of Thalivar. Gallio has found many coded journals inside the ruin, which he decrypted. He has now rebuilt the tower's planar beacon and is using it to study the creatures of the Ethereal Plane.

Gallio does not talk much about his work with adventurers but is willing to cast spells in exchange for gold. The mage casts the *legend lore* spell for 400 gp.

### Idol Island

Idol Island rises from the marshes a few yards from Leilon. It contains the remains of crumbled statues of forgotten human nobles. The settlers claim to hear whispered voices on the island at night, inviting them to view their destinies. If they characters walk by the island at night, they hear these whispers as well.

A character who spends the night on the island taking a long rest has vague, prophetic dreams of adventures to come. For instance, the character might view storm clouds swirling over Leilon, a galleon made from bones, or a glowing statue of a dwarf standing in a canyon. At the end of the rest, the character must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the character is bolstered by the strange dreams and gains inspiration. On a failure, the character gains a level of exhaustion.

### Knight's Goblet Inn

This coaching inn lay in ruin for decades, but has recently been rebuilt and reopened by Amrisiol Touchfire, a cunning half-elf female with the **noble** statistics. The inn caters to rich travelers and the wealthiest of Neverwinter's officers. Visitors must surrender their weapons and swear a "knightly oath" on entry to treat their fellow guests with honor and respect. Those who break their oaths are banned forever from the premises.

### Lathander Shrine

This shrine to Lathander, god of light, was the first temple to be reconstructed in Leilon. Merrygold Brightshine, an outgoing young female halfling **priest**, cares for the shrine and offers council to any who pray at the small stone altar to Lathander within. She conducts services at the shrine each day at dawn.

Merrygold casts the *cure wounds* spell for a donation of 10 gp to the shrine and the *lesser restoration* spell for a donation of 20 gp.

### Torver's Post

Jack Torver is an optimistic young male Turami human who just finished building Leilon's new (and currently only) general store. He is a devout worshipper of Lathander and attends the shrine's services each morning then offers advice from the sermons to his customers.

Jack sells standard adventuring gear, with the exception of *potions of healing*. He directs adventurers looking for potions to the Tymora shrine and those looking for armor or weapons to the town square.

### Town Gates

The town's north and south gates have recently been repaired and are now manned at all hours by 5 **guards** and 1 **veteran** guard captain. Each night, the heavy wood gates are pulled shut, preventing entry to the town until they are opened again at dawn. Travelers passing through town must pay a road toll of 1 sp per horse, oxen, cart, or mule that enters the gates.

### Town Square

The Leilon town square has become a place where local vendors and those passing through town can set up stalls to sell their wares. One vendor, a female Calishite human blacksmith named Zana Taylish, is a resident of Leilon who sells armor and weapons. More exotic items (such as *spell scrolls* or other consumable magic items) could be available from a traveling merchant in the square at the DMs discretion. The cost for such items should be high (and perhaps require a favor of the adventurers in addition to an exchange of coin).

### Tymora Shrine

A shrine to Tymora, goddess of luck, was recently erected in Leilon. Puck Caribdas, a lithe, rambunctious male elf, runs the temple and sells potions for the prices listed on the Puck's Potions table. Other than *potions of healing*, Puck only has 1d4 vials of each potion. Each tenday, Puck's inventory refreshes, and you can reroll to determine the elf's new potion supply.

##### Puck's Potions
|   Price  | Potion                      |
|:--------:|-----------------------------|
|   50 gp  | *Potion of healing*         |
|   50 gp  | *Potion of climbing*        |
|  150 gp  | *Potion of growth*          |
|  150 gp  | *Potion of water breathing* |
| 5,000 gp | *Potion of heroism*         |

### Tyr Shrine

The shrine to Tyr, god of justice, was recently repaired and reopened by Vangol Kuskolt, a male dwarf **priest** who clanks about on an iron peg leg. Many of the town's disputes are settled by Kuskolt on the steps outside his shrine. For the worst crimes, the dwarf heats his peg leg over the fire and brands the offender on the chest before driving them from town.

### Umber Hulk's Shell Inn

Alion Malwyn, a kind-heartedhuman, runs this newly constructed two-story inn. A bed for the night costs 5 sp, while a meal costs 1 sp. If the characters stay here, Alion shares a tale from another traveler with them. Roll 1d6 and consult the Leilon Tales table to determine which tale Alion knows or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet.

##### Leilon Tales
|  d6 | Tale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | "Folk say they've seen Old Gnawbone flying over the lowlands. That green dragon usually stays put in her lair inside Kryptgarden forest. For her to hunt this far afield surely spells trouble."                                                                                       |
|  2  | "Savage half-orcs have been spotted in the wilds outside of town, just standing there watching us. Trouble's coming, that's for sure."                                                                                                                                                 |
|  3  | "There are a couple of fancy pleasure barges anchored just off the marsh. City folk no doubt, but why they've stopped here is anybody's guess. Strange thing is, the crew have only been seen out at night." (If the characters investigate the site, see "*Icingdeath and Twinkle*.") |
|  4  | "Fish are dying inside the Mere of Dead Men. Something is poisoning the marsh waters and killing the animals that dwell within it. Watch what you drink here in town!"                                                                                                                 |
|  5  | "Fisher folk have reported seeing strange fogbanks at sea that move against the wind. Those who dared sail closer say they heard the sound of drumming from somewhere deep within."                                                                                                    |
|  6  | "Crazy Gallio has been locked up in his tower for weeks now. The sergeant says he doesn't let anyone up to the top floor anymore, and strange lights have been seen from his windows at night."(If the characters investigate the site, see "*Thalivar's Beacon*.")                    |

### Quayside

The recently rebuilt quayside has berths for town's many barges and fishing vessels. Fishing nets, coils of rope, and crab pots are laid out over the jetties, which are busy at most hours. Demelza Tackwind, a gruff old female Chondathan human **scout**, serves as the town's harbormaster. Vessels unregistered to Leilon must pay a berthing charge of 1 gp per day (part of which pays for Demelza's nightly tipple at the Umber Hulk's Shell).

### The Quest Board

The job board outside the fishery is where the adventurers can learn about quests. Let the players choose the order in which they tackle the quests. If the players don't like a quest, they are under no obligation to complete it. However, completing quests helps the characters become more powerful (see "Leveling Up").

Most of the notices on the job board are written by members of the town council. The council members are unable to provide context beyond what is written on the board. When the characters return to the fishery after completing a quest, the council pays the reward immediately.

> ##### Adventure Locations
>
>This adventure encourages characters to explore locations marked on the DM's map of the Sword Coast. When the characters embark on a journey to a location, use the section of this adventure that describes that location in detail. For instance, if the players choose to undertake the Dumathoin's Gulch Quest, go to the "*Dumathoin's Gulch*" section. Each location includes an overview that briefly describes what the characters can expect to find there. This overview is followed by information you'll need to run the encounters at that location.
>

#### Starting Quests

When the characters first visit the job board, there are three quests posted. Describe or show each quest so they can choose which to pursue.

#### Gulch Quest

"Leilon is threatened with invasion from several cults, one of which has an ancient dragon in its employ. The gnomes of Gnomengarde have offered to supply a magical weapon to drive off this beast should it trouble the town. Meet the gnomes at Dumathoin's Gulch, collect the weapon, and return to Leilon." If the characters undertake this quest, see "*Dumathoin's Gulch*."

#### Icingdeath and Twinkle Quest

"Two rival factions vie for control of the High Road: the cult of Talos, god of storms, and the cult of Myrkul, god of death. An emissary representing the Sword Coast's merchants would like you to sail to Neverwinter to petition Lord Neverember for troops to protect the road. The emissary's ships are anchored in a bay near Leilon, and the town council offers a reward of 1,500 gp for successfully negotiating aid." If the characters undertake this quest, see "*Icingdeath and Twinkle*."

#### Thalivar's Beacon Quest

"Leilon's wizard, Gallio Elibro, has recently rebuilt the planar beacon atop his tower and is using it to trap and study creatures from across the planes.Gallio has called for your help taming these beasts to defend the town against invasion." If the characters undertake this quest, see "*Thalivar's Beacon*."

#### Leilon Besieged Quest

There is no job board notice for this quest. Instead, it happens automatically after the players have completed two of the three starting quests. At this point, the rival cults launch their attack on the town to seize the House of Thalivar and steal the *ruinstone*. When the characters undertake this quest, see "*Leilon Besieged*." When this quest becomes active, remove the third starting quest from the quest board.

#### Follow-Up Quest

After the characters complete the "Battle for Leilon," the following two quests from Lord Neverember are added to the job board. Completing both these quests quashes the threat to the town and completes the adventure.

#### Storm Lord's Hideout Quest

"Seek out the undead galleon stolen by Fheralai Stormsworn, leader of the cult of Talos. Sink it to the bottom of the Sea of Swords, and then return to Neverwinter to collect a reward of 8,000 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, see "*Storm Lord's Hideout*."

#### Ebondeath's Mausoleum Quest

"The dread mage Ularan Mortus, leader of the cult of Myrkul, has roused the spirit of the undead dragon **Ebondeath**. Seek out **Ebondeath**'s mausoleum in the Mere of Dead Men, destroy the dragon's spirit, and then return to Neverwinter to collect a reward of 8,000 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, see "*Ebondeath's Mausoleum*."

### Leveling Up

Characters advance in level by completing quests. Regardless of the number of characters in the party, the rate of advancement is as follows:

- Characters gain a level when they complete the "Leilon Besieged" quest.
- Characters gain another level when they complete the remaining two follow-up quests in this adventure.

------

# Dumathoin's Gulch

"Dumathoin's Gulch" is balanced for characters of 11th level.

## Location Overview

Dumathoin's Gulch is a narrow canyon in the Sword Mountains, carved into the earth by a small but powerful stream that runs into the Mere of Dead Men. The gulch is named for the dwarven god of mining and protector of the dead, and the place has mysterious powers of its own that lead most to avoid it. This location is where the gnomes of Gnomengarde agree to meet the party and hand over their weapon: the *Gnomengarde grenade*.

The product of gnomish ingenuity and a dash of wild magic, the *Gnomengarde grenade* is the invention of two of Gnomengarde's most gifted inventors, Fibblestib Pinebark and Dabbledob Plasterpatch. Created when their town was threatened by the white dragon Cryovain, the grenade generates a number of unpredictable magical effects when detonated. The gnomes of Gnomengarde have promised the grenade to the residents of Leilon to drive off the green dragon Old Gnawbones. If delivered safely, the grenade should convince any other threats to leave the town in peace, not in pieces.

### Quest Goals

To complete the Gnomengarde's Grenade quest (see "The Quest Board"), the adventurers must obtain the magical grenade and escape Dumathoin's Gulch without the grenade getting stolen or destroyed.

## Travel to the Gulch

The Leilon authorities provide the party with directions to the gulch and explain that three gnomes named Fibblestib, Bindlemint, and Dabbledob will meet them there to turn over the *Gnomengarde grenade*. The gulch is situated almost twenty miles away, and the journey takes characters traveling on foot just over seven hours.

### Encounters on the Way

The characters have the following encounters as they approach Dumathoin's Gulch.

#### Panicked Gnome

The party hears a commotion in the forest as something hurries toward them. A gnome, Bindlemint Mincemower, emerges from the underbrush. Her clothes are torn and her face is bloodied by cuts, and she is terrified to the point of exhaustion. She only has enough energy to utter the word "beasts" before she collapses at the characters' feet. Moments later, a **wereboar**, plus one wereboar per character, including sidekicks, bursts onto the path and attacks.

Bindlemint is unharmed except for superficial cuts and exhaustion, so she can be easily revived. She explains that she was making her way to Leilon when the wereboars spotted her and gave chase. She was in the process of delivering terrible news: Dumathoin's Gulch was attacked earlier that day by terrible creatures that stank of death. They might have been looking for the grenade, but Bindlemint didn't hang around to ascertain their intentions. She fled, presuming that her two comrades were dead.

#### Gruesome Remains

When the party gets within 5 miles of Dumathoin's Gulch, they discover signs that local wildlife has been slaughtered indiscriminately. A cursory investigation reveals that these animalsÃ¢ÂÂsome as large as deer and others as small as haresÃ¢ÂÂwere killed using sharp swords. None of the animals were eaten or skinned; they were just slaughtered brutally and without cause.

Characters who succeed on DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Nature) check notice a single chipmunk watching the party from a tree. The chipmunk witnessed the slaughter in this area, and if magic is used to communicate with her, she relays that several skeletal creatures killed the animals and then continued toward the gulch.

## Arrival

When the characters arrive at the top of the gulch, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>A fast-moving stream crashes down the gulch. Tiers of rock ascend some seventy feet to the clifftop above, and two stone pillars, fifty feet above the gulch floor, are connected by a stone arch that spans the middle of the gulch. A crumpled gnome figure rests in the center of the arch.
>>
>>Near the rear of the gulch, a large glowing purple moonstone, carved into the form of a dwarf, stands on a rocky ledge. Glowing purple runes, etched into the ground and walls of the gulch, encircle the moonstone. Another gnomish figure rests, unmoving, with his back against the moonstone. Bones, bits of armor, and weapons are scattered around him.
>>

### Exploring the Gulch

Dumathoin's Gulch was once a dwarven mine, but the erosion of the stream exposed it to the sky. The mine contained a shrine to Dumathoin, and the power of that deity still infuses the area. As the characters explore, they fall prey to the undead present here (see "Undead Forces").

![Map 3: Dumathoin's Gulch](img/adventure/DC/005-5omvv-map-dumathoins-gulch_dm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/DC/006-oubp4-map-dumathoins-gulch_player.webp)
#### Cliffs

The gulch walls are uneven and climbable with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check even without proper climbing equipment.

#### Stone Arch

The stone arch is slippery. A creature attempting to use the Dash action while crossing the arch must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature slips and falls off the arch, taking damage from the fall appropriate to the section of the arch it fell from.

The gnome on the stone arch is Fibblestib Pinebark, and she holds the main part of the *Gnomengarde grenade*. She is unconscious when the characters arrive. The grenade has a piece of parchment tied to it that bears the following message in Common, *"Do not teleport or place in extradimensional spaces. Keep out of reach of children and orcs."*

#### Stream

The fast-moving stream at the bottom of the gulch is five feet deep and counts as difficult terrain. A creature that enters the stream or starts its turn in it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall prone due to the current.

#### Moonstone

The carved moonstone dwarf is a **sacred statue** that can be possessed by the resident **eidolon** (see appendix A) of Dumathoin to deal with intruders. Until the statue is possessed, it is just an object carved to represent Dumathoin. Refer to the "Guardian of the Gulch" section for information about awakening the eidolon.

The gnome resting against the moonstone is Dabbledob Plasterpatch. He holds the magical key that must be used to wind the grenade before it can be activated (see the "*Gnomengarde Grenade*" sidebar for more information). Dabbledob is frozen with fear and is unable to act until the undead threat has passed.

> ##### Moon Writing
>
>The moon writing is magical Dwarven rune script left by ancient worshippers of Dumathoin. The runes writhe and wriggle until a living creature gets within 5 feet of them. The inscription can only be read while it is still. To decipher it, a character must fulfil at least one of the following requirements:
>
>- Understand Dwarven and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion or Arcana) check.
>- Succeed on a DC 25 Intelligence (Religion or Arcana) check.
>- Belong to the cleric or paladin class and worship Dumathoin as a deity.

>A creature that deciphers the moon runes feels at one with the moonstone statue. As a bonus action, it can attempt a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to command the sacred statue. On a success, the creature takes control of the statue for its next turn. This is a mental compulsion, and the creature doing it does not need to speak but must be able to see the statue. If the check fails, the statue acts independently on its turn.
>

### Undead Forces

The following undead are present in the gulch:

***Boneclaw.*** Near the top of the gulch, a **boneclaw** (see *appendix A*) is hiding among the shadowy trees. As the characters move into the gulch, it rushes from its hiding place and attacks. If there are five or more characters in the party, including sidekicks, a second boneclaw accompanies the first.

Boneclaws can teleport using their Shadow Jump feature, giving them access to most areas of the gulchÃ¢ÂÂand possibly bringing anyone they are grappling with them! You can use this ability to trigger other aspects of the encounter ahead of time, which could complicate things, but also provide some memorable moments.

***Sword Wraith Platoon.*** When an adventurer enters the circle of moon runes, the bits of bone, armor, and weapons fly together to form an undead platoon. The platoon is led by a **sword wraith commander** plus one **sword wraith warrior** per character, including sidekicks (see *appendix A*).

The moonstone's magic temporarily incapacitated the undead here, but the life force of the adventurers brings them back. They immediately return to their mission: kill everything in the area and recover the *Gnomengarde grenade* for their master Ularan Mortus.

> ##### Gnome Reinforcements
>
>If the party needs assistance, ten gnomes from Gnomengarde arrive at the gulch. They intervene if the characters are in trouble, providing healing or drawing attacks to allow the characters to escape from immediate danger.
>
>Nine of the gnomes are **guards**, and the tenth is a **priest**. The priest, Favora Corehoarder, is a follower of Garl Glittergold, brave enough to put herself in danger to save others.
>

### Guardian of the Gulch

When the dwarves abandoned their mine, a particularly devout priest of Dumathoin called Sister Silvergranite insisted that she stay behind to guard the buried dead. She lived a hermit's life until she finally passed on herself. Dumathoin blessed her and transformed her spirit into an **eidolon** (see *appendix A*).

Sister Silvergranite remained here, even as the mine collapsed and became a gulch, exposed to the sky. When called upon to defend the area, she inhabits the large moonstone statue, which acts as her **sacred statue**. While exposed to the sky, the statue gains a fly speed of 25 feet.

When characters enter the inner circle of moon runes, Sister Silvergranite emerges from the moonstone to assess the situation, then withdraws and animates her sacred statue. She attacks the nearest creature, either living or undead, but ignores the gnomes. If the statue is destroyed, the eidolon emerges from the moonstone, appearing as a ghostly dwarf dressed in holy raiments of Dumathoin. If any adventurers took control of the sacred statue during the battle, the eidolon allows the party to leave unharmed. If not, a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check is required to convince Sister Silvergranite that the characters mean no harm and are only here to protect the gnomes.

### Conclusion

If the characters survive the combat and take possession of the grenade, they can return to Leilon with one more weapon for the impending fight to save the village. When they receive the grenade from the gnomes, they're given a thorough briefing on what it's capable of, as well as safety cautions regarding placing it in an extradimensional space or teleportation while the grenade is in one's possession.

# Ebondeath's Mausoleum

"**Ebondeath**'s Mausoleum" is balanced for characters of 12th level.

## Location Overview

Over a thousand years ago, the black dragon Chardansearavitriol, commonly known as **Ebondeath**, settled in the Mere of Dead Men, making his lair in the ruined citadel of Uthtower. **Ebondeath** became a dracolich and was worshiped by the Cult of the Dragon until the death god Myrkul's influence waned across FaerÃÂ»n and the dragon's bones turned to dust.

With Myrkul's return to the pantheon, his worshipers have quested across the seas to rekindle **Ebondeath**'s spirit. Led by the death priest Ularan Mortus, they unearthed the dragon's mausoleum and awakened its slumbering soul, binding it to the unwilling body of the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar. Ularan Mortus hoped to use the dragon to capture the *ruinstone*, an artifact of great power. While they remain on the Sword Coast, Ularan Mortus and his cultists have claimed **Ebondeath**'s mausoleum as their headquarters in the area.

Following the "*Leilon Besieged*" quest, **Ebondeath** returns to the mausoleum: either in spirit form without the artifact, or in Claugiyliamatar's body if it succeeded in stealing the *ruinstone*. In response, Lord Protector Neverember of Neverwinter offers the characters a purse of 8,000 gp to end the threat posed by the dragon.

### Quest Goals

To succeed in this quest, the characters must break into the mausoleum and destroy **Ebondeath**'s malevolent spirit.

## Travel to the Tomb

Once the party agrees to the contract, sages from Candlekeep send a messenger (via teleportation) with written directions to **Ebondeath**'s Mausoleum. The mausoleum lies under the Uthtower, an ancient keep swallowed by the mere. Trekking on foot into the salt marshes is arduous work, with or without a barge, and the journey takes well over a day.

Due to the recent proliferation (and likely destruction) of a great deal of undead from this region, the characters are likely to simply have a miserable day trudging through the muck. However, if you so wish, feel free to through in an encounter or two with undead that are fleeing the site of the battle at Leilon.

## Arrival

Uthtower is buried deep beneath the bog. Using undead as laborers, Ularan Mortus excavated a deep shaft into the mud, shored up with wooden beams. Crude iron rungs were hammered into the walls of this pit, providing access to the entry hall of the catacombs (area E1). On the surface, the entrance looks like nothing more than a timber latrine sitting in the middle of nowhere. The shaft inside descends 120 feet to the catacombs below.

Characters who search the surface area and succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Nature or Investigation) check discern that a nearby saltwater lake has been recently disturbed: mud is splattered around the shore as though a *wave* of water was violently displaced here. The lake is very deep and connects via a murky underwater tunnel to the pool in area E8 of the mausoleum below. The dragon uses this route to enter and exit its lair.

> ##### Mausoleum Features
>
>**Ebondeath**'s mausoleum has the following general features.
>
>***Lighting.*** Unless noted otherwise, the mausoleum is completely unlit and pitch dark. Adventurers require darkvision or their own light sources to see in here.

>***Construction.*** Ceilings, walls, and floors throughout the mausoleum are made from worked stone lined with granite flagstones. Ceilings are 30 feet high inside rooms and 20 feet high inside corridors.

>***Doors.*** Doors inside the mausoleum are 12 feet high and crafted of ebony engraved with images of death. Doors are unlocked but heavy, requiring a successful DC 12 Strength check to open. Unless otherwise noted, the doors groan loudly when opened.

>***Rubble.*** Large sections of the tomb have collapsed over the centuries. Areas of loose rubble count as difficult terrain and grant half cover to creatures hiding there.

>**Wards**. The mausoleum is under the permanent effect of a *forbiddance* spell that is set to damage any fey creatures that enter. When a fey creature enters the mausoleum for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage.

![Map 4: Ebondeath's Mausoleum](img/adventure/DC/007-nokov-map-ebondeaths-mausoleum_dm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/DC/008-xva5z-map-ebondeaths-mausoleum_player.webp)
### Mausoleum Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map of **Ebondeath**'s Mausoleum:

#### E1. Entry Hall

Read the following boxed text aloud when the characters descend the shaft into this area:

>>The shaft descends into a worked stone hallway. One end of the hall has collapsed, and the other terminates in a pair of giant ebony doors. A thin layer of mist swirls over the floor and the air is unnaturally cold. As you step onto the flagstones, a voice from nowhere whispers:
>>
>>"Who is dead but cannot die, the Lord of Bones, whose embrace is patient but sure?"
>>

A *detect magic* spell reveals that the voice is an illusion. Characters who succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check recognize the "Lord of Bones" as one of the ancient titles given to Myrkul, god of the dead. If a character says this name aloud, the door at the end of the hallway silently opens.

#### E2. Cultist Camp

This chamber was once a storeroom but is now used as a camp for Ularan Mortus's cultists. Bedrolls are laid over the floor and a fire burns in a brazier in the center of the room. There is one **necromancer** in here, plus one **ghast** and one **priest** for every character in the party, including sidekicks.

The characters surprise the cultists if they sneak up on them after silently opening the door from area E1. If combat ensues here, any monsters present in areas E3 and E4 are alerted to the battle and arrive after 1d4 + 1 rounds. The cultists in area E5 remain where they are but begin their summoning chant.

**Treasure**. The cultists carry 170 gp and 105 ep in loose coins, as well as five *potions of healing*.

![Zombie Lair in Water](img/adventure/DC/009-fui5e-zombie-lair-in-water.webp)

#### E3. Wine Cellar

Small, round peg holes on the walls are all that remain of the wine racks that once lined this cellar. The cultists use this space to house their mindless dead. There is one **greater zombie** in here per character in the party, including sidekicks.

***Secret Door.*** The secret door in here leads to area E6 and can be uncovered with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. To pop it open, a character must twist a torch bracket on the wall.

#### E4. High Priest's Chamber

This chamber is used by Ularan Mortus and contains his backpack, bedroll, and a casket of treasures. Two giants' skulls are mounted to the wall. If Ularan Mortus survived the "*Leilon Besieged*" quest, he is present here. Ularan Mortus has the statistics of a **war priest**. If **Ebondeath** recovered the *ruinstone* from Leilon, Ularan Mortus wields it in battle here (see the "Using the Ruinstone" sidebar).

***Treasure.*** The death priest's backpack contains 700 gp, 35 pp, *eyes of minute seeing*, and the following spell scrolls: *raise dead*, *forbiddance*, and *holy aura*.

> ##### Using the Ruinstone
>
>Once per day as a bonus action, a villain can activate the *ruinstone* to undo one deed they have performed. The possibilities here are broad, but in combat it's simplest to allow them the opportunity to "rewind" one action and take it again, or to reroll a failed saving throw (if it can still take actions). . Each use of the artifact has a terrible side effect: someone known to the wielder is also erased from reality. After the villain uses the *ruinstone*, roll a d20: on a 5-20, one of their allies disintegrates, on an 1-4, one of the player characters disintegrates. If a creature bound its soul to the *ruinstone* in the "*Thalivar's Beacon*" quest, the artifact explodes when used and the creature who is bound to it disintegrates.
>

#### E5. Ritual Room

These ancient barracks have been cleared for use as a ritual room. A huge circle of ash has been laid out over the floor, surrounding a skull design painted in human blood. Around the circle, the cultists of Myrkul kneel in prayer for guidance from their god.There is one **cult fanatic** here for every character in the party, including sidekicks. Cultists who detect trouble nearby chant to their god for aid. If at least one cultist chants for three rounds, a **bone devil** appears in the circle to serve the cult.

***Secret Door.*** The secret door in here leads to area E6 and can be uncovered with a DC 12 Intelligence (Perception) check. Characters who succeed on this check notice muddy scrapes on the floor beneath the concealed door.

#### E6. Halls of the Fiend

The hallways are haunted by the grotesque vestige of **Ebondeath**'s first high priest. This creature squirms along the passages and can be encountered anywhere in the area or in the nearby Vaults of the Uthlords (area E7). The vestige appears as a bloated, drowned **death knight** with horribly long arms. Its Longsword attack is replaced with the following attack:

**Ghoulish Claws**. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 7 (1d4 + 5) slashing damage, plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### E7. Vaults of the Uthlords

Each of these burial chambers houses the remains of a different noble family of Uthtower. Their bones are interred inside niches in the walls, which are 3 feet wide, 3 feet high, 9 feet deep, and stacked three high along the walls.

When characters who aren't devoted followers of Myrkul enter these chambers, the heaped bones begin to quietly stir. Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check notice the bone piles shifting. If a character disturbs the bones or returns to the same room, the bones arise from their niches and form skeletal swarms. Each burial chamber contains two **skeletal swarms** per character in the party, including sidekicks.

#### E8. Crypt of the First Royals

If the characters approach this area from the west, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Graven steps ascend into a wide, octagonal chamber with a high, vaulted ceiling. The mosaic floor is littered with rubble, and a pool of murky water floods the far side of the chamber. Strange fungi cling to the moist walls.
>>
>>To the north, an arched hallway plunges into the dark. As you approach, a hollow voice booms from beyond: "Who dares disturb the rest of Chardansearavitriol the **Ebondeath**?"
>>

The characters now face **Ebondeath**. If the dragon fled Leilon in spirit form (see the "*Leilon Besieged*" quest), the party faces a spectral version of the dragon. This has the statistics a **ghost**, with the following important modifications:

- It has AC 15 and 225 hit points.
- The saving throw DC to resist its Possession power is now DC 20. When it possesses a creature, it gains access to their knowledge, class features, and proficiencies.
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Ebondeath** uses its possession ability to jump between party members and turn them against each other. It fights to the end to protect its resting place.

If **Ebondeath** left the "*Leilon Besieged*" quest in **Claugiyliamatar's** body, the party is now in trouble. **Ebondeath** has the statistics of **Claugiyliamatar**, except his breath weapon deals necrotic damage instead of poison damage due to **Ebondeath**'s possession. If the characters slay the dragon, they must then also face the ghost within!

#### E9. Ebondeath's Lair

This ruined burial hall contains a heap of treasures that Cult of Myrkul have left as offerings to the dragon.

***Treasure.*** The treasures gathered here comprise 14,000 gp, 1,750 pp, ten jet gemstones worth 100 gp each, two *potions of supreme healing*, a *potion of storm giant strength*, and a *circlet of blasting*.

### Conclusion

Characters who destroy **Ebondeath**'s spirit can report their success to the authorities in Neverwinter, who award them a purse of 8,000 gp. If this is the final quest, their adventure ends here (see "*Ending the Adventure*" for more information).

# Icingdeath and Twinkle

"Icingdeath and Twinkle" is balanced for characters of 11th level.

## Location Overview

Jarlaxle Baenre, a male drow of considerable wealth and power, is the secret lord of Luskan and the head of the Bregan D'aerthe, a faction of renegade drow. He owns two magnificent warships, *Icingdeath* and *Twinkle*, named after the swords of Jarlaxle's sometimes friend, sometimes enemy, Drizzt Do'Urden.

Jarlaxle has much to gain if Leilon's rebuilding is successful, and even more to lose if the followers of Myrkul or Talos control the High Road. He sends members of the Bregan D'aerthe disguised as human merchants to Leilon aboard *Icingdeath* and *Twinkle*. The disguised drow beg the Leilon town council to entreat Lord Dagult Neverember to secure the road with troops from Neverwinter. The town council agrees to send the characters with the disguised merchants to plead their case.

In Luskan, pirates belonging to a lowly faction called Ship Rethnor plan to improve their station by kidnapping the captains of *Icingdeath* and *Twinkle*, forcing Jarlaxle to bargain for their lives. Galas Windrage, a priest of Talos loyal to Ship Rethnor, proposed this plan, knowing that success will bring the cult more allies in the battle to conquer Leilon.

### Quest Goals

To complete the Icingdeath and Twinkle Quest (see "The Quest Board"), adventurers must convince Dagult Neverember to secure the High Road, then survive the journey back to Leilon.

## Arrival

*Icingdeath* and *Twinkle* are anchored near the shore ten miles west of Leilon. The characters can travel overland or take barges. When they can see the ships, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Two magnificent ships are anchored just beyond the marshy shore. Both have long strips of decorative cloth stretched from the tops of their masts down to the railings around their decks. The smaller of the ships is decorated with blue, pink, and purple fabric, and has a massive figurehead shaped like a charging unicorn with a prominent gold horn. A name on the side of this ship reads Twinkle.
>>
>>The larger ship is adorned with white and gold fabric, and its figurehead looks like a lavender-eyed drow leaping forward to attack with twin scimitars. An enormous roaring panther head is attached the aft of this ship. The name on its side reads Icingdeath.
>>

If the characters are traveling by barge, they can row to the side of the ship, where the ship's captain welcomes them aboard. If the characters travel overland to the ships, both captains send rowboats to collect them from the shore. The characters are free to travel on whichever ship they choose, though characters who can cast spells are encouraged to travel aboard *Icingdeath* and meet the ship's mage captain!

### Drow Crews

*Icingdeath* and *Twinkle* each have a crew of forty neutral **drow** sailors. Drow have a reputation as evil, subterranean slavers and are not generally trusted by humanoids living on the surface. While this is not true of the ships' crews, they fear persecution and suspicion, so they are disguised as humans thanks to the ship's figureheads (see the "Icingdeath and Twinkle Features" sidebar). The sailors are focused on the task of sailing the ship and engage with the characters as little as possible. While the characters are aboard, the drow spend most of their time working on the decks of the ships, but might retreat below deck to eat, rest, or get a break from the light of day.

Each ship has six officers: a captain, a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, a surgeon, and a cook. Each officer is disguised as a merchant going to Neverwinter to beg for Lord Neverember's aid. The officers and Captain Deloz Montiv of *Twinkle* are neutral **drow elite warriors**. Captain Xalti Tezzan of *Icingdeath* is a chaotic neutral **drow mage**. The officers can be wherever you choose on the ship and likely move about as they spend time with the characters.

> ##### Discovering the Drow
>
>Any character who spends 1 hour observing a ship's crew can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, the character notices that most crew members speak Common with an Elvish accent and exchange hand signals when they think no one is looking. A drow character recognizes the hand signals as Drow Sign Language.
>
>The changes wrought by the magic of the ships' figureheads fail to hold up to physical inspection, meaning that characters who physically interact with crew members have a chance to notice the illusion. Additionally, any drow character who boards one of these ships instantly takes on the illusory form of a human.
>

### Meeting the Ship Captains

Captain Deloz of *Twinkle* is disguised as a male Rashemi human weapon merchant. He is quiet, calculating, and observant. The captain often does random inspections of his crew, and checks in on his passengers to make sure they're comfortable (and not getting into trouble).

Captain Xalti of *Icingdeath* is disguised as a male Calishite human iron merchant. He is impulsive, nosy, and confident. The captain enjoys showing off his magic and making a bet on the outcome of almost any event.

Each captain wears a *hat of disguise* so they can maintain their illusionary appearance while not on the ship. The drow keep their real identities secret from the characters, but do not deny it if they are accused or caught. They're not willing to die to keep their identities secret.

> ##### Icingdeath and Twinkle Features
>
>Both *Icingdeath* and *Twinkle* are more prepared for battle than they seem and share the following general features.
>
>***Ballistas.*** Both ships have are equipped with ballistae. For more information, see "*Siege Equipment*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

>***Ceilings.*** The ceilings in the lower deck, holds, and cabins of the ships are 8 feet high with 6-foot-high doorways.

>***Doors.*** The ships' doors are made of wood and have AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

>***Figureheads.*** A *detect magic* spell or similar magic reveals an aura of illusion magic around either ship's figureheadÃ¢ÂÂthe effect that makes every drow aboard the ship appear as a human. A drow's gender, height, and weight are unchanged; the illusion affects only appearance, not voice or mannerisms. Casting *dispel magic* on a disguised drow causes the illusion around it to wink out, but only for a moment. An *antimagic field* (including the one generated by the crystal on *Twinkle* in area T5) suppresses the figurehead's magic within the field's area. Destroying the figurehead ends the effect throughout the ship. A figurehead has AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

>***Light.*** Hanging lanterns cast bright light throughout the ships.

>***Rigging.*** Rigging on the ships can be climbed without an ability check.

>***Sails.*** The ships each have three 80-foot-tall masts with sails to catch the wind and oars on the lower deck for rowing.

>***Statistics.*** Each ship has the statistics of a warship (see "*Unusual Environments*" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

>***Sunshield.*** The decorative cloth hanging from the masts of each ship can be unfurled to create a sunshield, shading the deck of the ship in dim light and allowing the drow to avoid the penalties from their Sunlight Sensitivity feature. It takes one creature 1 minute to unfurl all the cloths on a ship. Multiple creatures working together can reduce the time proportionately.

![Map 5: Icingdeath and Twinkle](img/adventure/DC/010-ibovp-map-icingdeath-and-twinkle_dm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/DC/011-enh49-map-icingdeath-and-twinkle_player.webp)
### Icingdeath Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map of *Icingdeath*.

#### I1. Icingdeath Main Deck

A rowboat on this deck of the ship covers a hatch used for loading and unloading large cargo into the main hold (area I7).

A 3-foot-high capstan near the middle of the deck is locked in place. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds that one of the capstan's spokes has a hidden button. Pressing the button unlocks and locks the capstan. While unlocked, a creature can use their action to turn the capstan clockwise, raising the six ballistae and the ammunition in the cargo hold through the six trap doors (three on the port side and three on the starboard side) onto the main deck. While the ballistae are raised, turning the capstan counterclockwise as an action lowers the weapons back into the cargo hold.

***Magic Statue.*** An 8-foot-tall, 4,000-pound stone statue of Drizzt Do'Urden, a famous drow ranger, stands near the front of the main deck, posed with hands on the pommels of his famous, sheathed scimitars. The statue's mouth is open in a goofy grin. A *detect magic* spell reveals that the statue radiates an aura of transmutation magic. Whenever a creature on the main deck speaks the statue's command word ("Artemis"), the statue animates and obeys the creature who animated it. As a bonus action, the creature can direct the statue to move up to 30 feet or shoot a stream of water out of its mouth at a target within 30 feet of the statue. The stream of water has the same effect as the geyser option of a *decanter of endless water*. If the command word is spoken by that creature again, the statue returns to its original position on the ship and is no longer animate. The statue has AC 17, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Captain Xalti Tezzan (see "Drow Crews") knows the statue's command word.

#### I2. Icingdeath Forecastle

This deck contains a ballista and ten bolts for the siege weapon, secured with rope.

#### I3. Icingdeath Aftercastle

This deck holds the ship's wheel. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a hidden button on center of the wheel. As an action, a creature can press the button, causing the panther head attached to the aft of the ship to release a 20-foot-square patch of oil onto the surface of the sea, which the head then ignites by releasing a jet of flame from its mouth. The oil burns on the surface of the water for 1 minute. Creatures and objects that enter or start their turn in the burning oil take 18 (4d8) fire damage.

#### I4. Icingdeath Captain's Cabin

The door to this cabin is locked (see the "Icingdeath and Twinkle Features" sidebar). Captain Xalti Tezzan (see "Drow Crews") holds the key. If the characters enter this room, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Silk pillows and discarded robes surround a central two-foot-high table attached to the floor. At the back of the room, a small wooden chest is built into the wall.
>>

The inside lid of the chest is covered by a **swarm of insects spiders**), which attack any creature who opens the chest, expect Xalti. The chest contains Xalti's spellbook, which includes all the spells he has prepared, as well as *detect magic*, *find familiar*, and *fireball*. The inside cover of the spellbook also contains the phrase "Artemis animates" in Elvish (a clue to animating the statue in area I1).

#### I5. Chart Room

This cabin contains a 3-foot-high table set with navigator's tools, as well as two easels and two frames on the walls holding nautical maps of the Sword Coast.

***Secret Door.*** A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the outline of a secret door in the wall that leads to area I6.

#### I6. Oil Pump Room

When the characters enter this room, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Three brass cylindrical canisters, one at the middle of the cabin and two at either end, stand upright, connected to each other by long pipes which converge and exit to the aft of the ship.
>>

Each 1-foot-diameter, 2-foot-high, 50-pound canister is filled with oil used by the panther head attached to the aft of the ship (see area I3). A character can detach a canister of oil from the pipes with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check using tinker's tools. If more than one oil canister is disconnected, the panther head does not function.

If a canister takes 5 or more points of fire damage from a single spell or attack, it explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere. Creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This also catches the ship on fire, and will require immediate attention to keep it from spreading any further.

#### I7. Icingdeath Main Hold

The sailors rest in shifts using the sixteen hammocks strung up in cabin around many stacked crates. The crates hold rations, supplies needed to maintain and repair the ship, and small barrels of fresh water and ale.

There are also six ballistae below deck, each with ten bolts of ammunition secured by ropes beneath. When the capstan on the main deck (area I1) is turned, a gear wrapped around a pillar connected to the capstan also turns, raising the ballistae and ammunition to the main deck via rising pillars.

#### I8. Icingdeath Galley

Crew members converse, play games, and share meals around the table and eight chairs attached to the floor of this cabin.

#### I9. Icingdeath Cargo Cabin

Several large crates are secured in this cabin. A peek inside the crates reveals what appear to be iron ingots, bars of gold and silver, and other trade goods. Interacting with these objects reveals they are made of painted wood.

### Twinkle Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map of *Twinkle*.

#### T1. Twinkle Main Deck

A rowboat on this deck of the ship covers a hatch used for loading and unloading large cargo into the main hold (area T6).

#### T2. Twinkle Forecastle

This deck contains a ballista and ten bolts for the siege weapon, secured with rope.

#### T3. Twinkle Aftercastle

This deck holds the ship's wheel, which is always operated by at least one member of the crew. A trap door in the floor opens when the crank in area T5 is pulled, raising the *antimagic crystal* onto this deck.

#### T4. Twinkle Captain's Cabin

The door to this cabin is locked (see the "Icingdeath and Twinkle Features" sidebar). Captain Deloz Montiv (see "Drow Crews") holds the key. If the characters enter this room, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>This simple, spotless cabin has a bare desk and chair built into the floor at the center of the room. A twin bed at the back of the room is covered in plain white sheets.
>>

A character who searches the drawers of the desk finds several maps of the waters around the Sword Coast, quite a few romance novels, and a diary written in Elvish tracking the tides around Luskan.

***Treasure.*** A character who searches the bed finds a concealed drawer in the bed frame, beneath the sheets. Inside the drawer are Deloz's neatly folded clothing and a *potion of water breathing*

#### T5. Crystal Chamber

The door to this cabin is locked (see the "Icingdeath and Twinkle Features" sidebar). Captain Deloz Montiv (see "Drow Crews") holds the key. If the characters enter this room, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>A six-foot tall glowing blue crystal stands in the middle of the chamber. A three-foot-long lever sticks up from the floor on the starboard side of the cabin.
>>

As an action, a character can pull the lever, causing the floor beneath the *antimagic crystal* to rise on a pillar and the trap door in area T3 to open, placing the crystal in area T3. Pulling the lever again causes the crystal to drop back into this cabin.

***Antimagic Crystal.*** The antimagic crystal creates a 200-foot-radius sphere of antimagic, as in the *antimagic field* spell, centered on the crystal. While inside the cabin, the crystal's effect is contained in the room. The crystal has AC 13, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### T6. Twinkle Main Hold

The sailors rest in shifts using the floor and the four hammocks strung up in this cabin. Several stacked crates near in the fore of the hold contain rations, supplies needed to maintain and repair the ship, and small barrels of fresh water and ale.

#### T7. Twinkle Galley

Crew members converse, play games, and share meals around the table and eight chairs attached to the floor of this cabin..

#### T8. Twinkle Cargo Cabin

Several large crates are secured in this cabin. A peek inside the crates reveals what appear to be iron ingots, bars of gold and silver, and other trade goods. Interacting with these objects reveals they are made of painted wood.

## Events

The following events occur during this quest.

### Journey to Neverwinter

It takes the ships almost an entire day to travel to Neverwinter. Give the characters a chance to explore the ship, chat with the captains, and plan what they want to say to sway Dagult Neverember to action.

### Audience with Neverember

After the ships arrive in Neverwinter, the ship captains waste no time leading the characters to an audience with Lord Dagult Neverember in Castle Never. Read the following boxed text aloud to set the scene:

>>You stand in the great marble hall of Castle Never, on a red carpet that leads up to a throne. Atop the chair sits a serious man in shining plate armor and blue cloak with gold trim. Lord Dagult Neverember strokes his short, gray beard as he listens to the pleas of the captains to secure the High Road and send troops to Leilon. When they finish, the lord turns toward you.
>>
>>"Each of you make your case. Why should I send my troops to Leilon? By all accounts it should be able to defend itself now. I've already poured many resources into the town and it has yet to pay anything back."
>>

Encourage each character to make a case to Dagult. After making their statement, the character should make a DC 13 ability check. In cases of simple argument, this is a Charisma (Persuasion) check, but allow the characters to get creative. For instance, characters who try to scare Dagult with stories of their enemies could make a Charisma (Intimidation or Performance) check, and characters who try to use a historical example or allegory could make an Intelligence (History) check. Grant advantage on the check to characters who make a well-reasoned or passionate argument.

- If the all the characters succeed on the check, Neverember agrees to secure the High Road and Leilon at no cost to the town.
- If more than half the characters succeed, Neverember agrees to Leilon's demands provided that the Leilon town council pays 250 gp to help cover costs.
- If half or fewer (but at least one) of the characters succeed, Neverember agrees to Leilon's demands provided that the Leilon town council pays 500 gp to help cover costs.
- If none of the characters succeed, Neverember agrees to Leilon's demands provided that the Leilon town council pays 1,000 gp to help cover costs.

### Journey Back to Leilon

After the meeting with Dagult Neverember, the captains are eager to return the characters to Leilon with news of the lord's decision. During the return journey, the characters experience the following encounters.

#### Invisible Assassins

The Talos priest Galas Windrage sends **invisible stalkers** to the ship the characters are traveling on, to kill the captains and officers before the coming battle. There is one invisible stalker per two members of the party, including sidekicks. The encounter begins when the characters hear the captain yell from his cabin as he is attacked. The stalkers fight to the death.

#### Storm

Galas Windrage creates a storm to distract the characters and their allies before the coming battle. When the storm begins, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Lightning and thunder suddenly crack a dark sky as heavy rain pours from above. Cries of, "Hurricane! All hands on deck!" can be heard throughout the vessel. The sailors need all the help they can get.
>>

The characters can help the sailors fight the storm by making any of the following ability checks:

- Characters who help the sailors push through the storm by securing ropes and tying down cargo and equipment must make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
- Character who attempt to steer the ship's wheel must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using water vehicles.
- Characters who help the sailors navigate through the storm must make a successful DC 15 Intelligence check using navigator's tools.
- Allow the characters to attempt other DC 15 ability checks that make sense. For instance, a character trying to inspire others to work harder without fear of the storm could make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

After each character has had a chance to make an ability check, the storm ends. Determine the results of their actions:

- If all the characters succeeded on their checks, the ships make it through the storm unscathed.
- If half or more of the characters succeeded, their ship takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage from the storm.
- If fewer than half of the characters succeeded, their ship takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage from the storm.

#### Battle on the Sword Sea

When the storm ends, *Icingdeath* and *Twinkle* are within 400 feet of *Throatcutter*, a warship, and *Thunderstrike*, a longship (see "*Unusual Environments*" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for statistics). Read the following boxed text aloud to set the scene:

>>The sky becomes clear and sunny as the rain begins to clear, revealing two nearby ships. The smaller vessel, a longship, rows quickly toward you, its crew chanting in prayer. The larger vessel, a warship armed with ballista and catapults, has a large crow painted on its sails. The officers of your vessels cry, "Ship Rethnor! Battle stations!" The ship captain looks at you and says, "Direct the siege weapons!"
>>

*Throatcutter* has the following crew and weapons:

- Six officers: a captain, a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, a surgeon, and a cook (chaotic evil **bandit captains**).
- Forty sailors (chaotic evil **bandits**).
- Two ballista and two mangonels (see "*Siege Weapons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

*Thunderstrike* has the following crew:

- A captain, Galas Windrage, a female chaotic evil **war priest** of Talos (see *appendix A*).
- Forty sailors (chaotic evil **cultists**).
- Ten chaotic evil **berserkers** who attempt to board enemy vessels and kill the crew.

Instead of having each sailor act individually, on each turn assume that they move the ship its speed and aim, load, and fire its siege weapons. Allow the characters to decide how allied ships move and which vessels allied siege weapons attack.

***Ending the Battle.*** If the characters sink *Throatcutter* and *Thunderstrike*, or kill all the enemy officers, any remaining enemies try to retreat by any means necessary. Characters who interrogate a captured pirate or cultist learn who is behind the attack with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check.

### Reward

When the characters return to Leilon with word of Dagult Neverember's decision, they are given a reward of 1,500 gp minus the money that must be paid to Neverwinter (see "Audience with Neverember").

# Leilon Besieged

"Leilon Besieged" is balanced for characters of 11th level. The quest is triggered when the characters complete two of the three starting quests.

## Quest Overview

Ularan Mortus, high priest of the death god Myrkul, has mustered an undead army to invade Leilon and seize the mystical *ruinstone* from the House of Thalivar. As he makes his move, cultists of the storm god Talos, led by Fheralai Stormsworn, assault the town to steal the stone before it falls into their enemy's hands. Caught in the middle, the characters must marshal Leilon's forces and hold the line against both armies.

## Quest Goals

To succeed in this quest, the characters must survive the battle. If they achieve any result other than "Crushing Defeat," they'll earn a reward from the town council (see "Determining Victory" for instructions on calculating victory results).

## Running the Battle

This quest is an epic battle involving hundreds of rival combatants. Use the following rules to resolve the conflict.

### Narrative Combat

Instead of resolving the battle with miniatures, you'll guide your players through a series of tough dilemmas, each leading to a different battlefield encounter. Their actions on the field determine the overall success or failure of the battle.

Use the Battle Flowchart provided nearby to guide your players through the conflict. Each box on the chart introduces a different mission, event, or dilemma (see "Battlefield Events"). When the players get to the end of the flowchart, count their victories to determine the success or failure of the overall conflict (see "Determining Victory"). If your players use clever tactics during the battle, grant them one or more of the following benefits, as appropriate:

- Their enemies are frightened for one or more rounds.
- The players surprise their enemies in the next combat.
- The players gain advantage on any ability checks related to their current task.
- Each character gains inspiration.
- If the players fail this objective, their allies still triumph.

It's possible that your players will veer off from the events on the flowchart. In this case, you'll need to improvise encounters based on the enemies' plan of attack (see "Order of Events"). Feel free to add your own victories if the players achieve their chosen goals. Players who split the party are likely to be overwhelmed, but that's the risk they take for splitting up!

### Random Encounters

Each time the group undertakes a new challenge on the Battle Flowchart, roll a d12 on the Random Encounters table. Try to incorporate the resulting event into the scene when it feels most appropriate.

##### Random Encounters
| d12 | Encounter                                                                                                                              |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | An allied unit is being overwhelmed, but the nearest officer is frozen with fear and won't give the order to reinforce them.           |
|  2  | Ghouls have surrounded a hospital cart. People are dying, but the distraction is giving nearby allied units an opportunity to advance. |
|  3  | A mounted group of Neverwinter knights prepare to charge valiantly to their doom.                                                      |
|  4  | An acolyte of Tymora tries to quash rumors that the Maimed God Tyr has promised to turn anyone who dies in his name into an angel.     |
|  5  | Allied soldiers ask the characters to discipline a group of deserters hiding out in a nearby barn.                                     |
|  6  | Townsfolk call for the characters' aid as the shrine of Tymora goes up in flames.                                                      |
|  7  | A cart carrying medical supplies sinks into the mud, dragging its oxen down with it.                                                   |
|  8  | Lightning ignites the roof of a nearby house. Locals are hiding out in the cellar but going to their aid could betray their position.  |
|  9  | A blackguard cultist yells for a worthy enemy to face them in single combat.                                                           |
|  10 | A group of routed defenders are busy looting a house, supply cart, or command tent.                                                    |
|  11 | Nearby troops waver in fear and look to the characters for inspiration.                                                                |
|  12 | One of the enemies goes berserk and starts cutting down enemy and ally alike.                                                          |

### Resting

The battle is intense, with no real opportunities for rest. If the players insist on taking a short rest, advance to the next box on the Battle Flowchart, taking whichever battlefield result is least positive. If the characters are resting when they would otherwise make a choice, their allies choose for them.

### How Many Combatants?

The number of NPCs fighting each other in each scene is left intentionally vague. By keeping this mysterious, you can introduce reinforcements or trigger routs whenever it feels most dramatic to do so. Even so, it helps to have a rough idea of how each side compares.

***Defenders.*** Leilon is defended by just over 200 **commoners**, **guards**, and guard **veterans**. If the players negotiated reinforcements in the "*Icingdeath and Twinkle*" quest, an additional 300 **guards**, **knights**, and **scouts** are also present.

***Cult of Talos.*** The **war priest** Fheralai Stormsworn besieges Leilon with an army of 400 **cultists**, cult **priests**, and **anchorites of Talos**. Her elite warriors are **blackguards** or **half-blue dragon gladiators** (see *appendix A*).

***Cult of Myrkul.*** The god Myrkul has performed a miracle to awaken the undead from the Mere of Dead Men and gifted them to his **war priest** Ularan Mortus. In total, just over 800 **ghouls**, **ghasts**, and **zombies** bow to his command, with a handful of **boneclaws** and **greater zombies** at the head (see *appendix A*). His greatest weapon is the ancient green dragon **Claugiyliamatar**, who is possessed by the unholy spirit of the dracolich **Ebondeath**.

### Use of Magic

Magic plays a powerful role on a fantasy battlefield. A wizard armed with *fireball* or *lightning bolt* serves as a deadly artillery unit, while clerics can roam the battlefield, using *cure wounds* to heal the injured. In the chaos of battle, spells such as *message*, *sending*, or *thaumaturgy* can make the difference between triumph and disaster.

In a narrative battle, the simplest way to adjudicate such spells outside of combat is to grant an ad-hoc benefit to the party (see "Narrative Combat"). If a spell creates a powerful effect that sways the course of the battle, consider granting the caster's side an additional victory.

### Determining Victory

At the end of the battle, count the group's victories to determine the result of the battle.

##### Victory Results
| Victories | Result                             |
|:---------:|------------------------------------|
|     0     | Crushing Defeat                    |
|    1-2    | Defeat                             |
|     3     | Pyrrhic Victory (1,000 gp reward)  |
|    4-5    | Victory (2,500 gp reward)          |
|     6+    | Decisive Victory (5,000 gp reward) |

#### Crushing Defeat

Ularan Mortus claims the *ruinstone*. Leilon is sacked and its inhabitants put to the sword. Both enemy generals survive, along with the dragon.

#### Defeat

The *ruinstone* is claimed by the enemy. Leilon fends off the attack, but the defenders are decimated. At least one enemy general survives.

#### Pyrrhic Victory

#### Victory

The *ruinstone* remains hidden. Leilon holds, and more than half the defenders survive. At least one enemy general is slain.

#### Great Victory

The *ruinstone* remains hidden. Leilon holds, and most of the defenders survive. Both enemy generals and the dragon are slain.

![Battle Flowchart](img/adventure/DC/012-ozw9h-flowchart-export.webp)

## Order of Events

The attack begins just before dawn, when Ularan Mortus assaults the south gate with a huge force of ghouls. Soon after, an even larger force of zombies emerges from the mere to invade the quayside. The defenders rally to protect the town but are outnumbered.

While the defenders struggle to hold the perimeter, Fheralai Stormsworn's forces breach the north gate and pour forward to seize the town square. Ularan Mortus responds by deploying his dragon, **Ebondeath**, which swoops in from the east and decimates Stormsworn's forces gathered in the square. The cultists of Talos are forced to fall back and regroup.

As Ularan Mortus's army forces its way into Leilon, **Ebondeath** reaches the House of Thalivar and searches for the *ruinstone*. Unless stopped, it claims the stone and flies back to its hiding place in the mere. Ularan Mortus withdraws in victory to his headquarters. Stormsworn's troops intercept his entourage outside town, but her reduced forces are beaten back. The remaining members of both sides retreat to their respective headquarters.

## The Battle Begins

When the battle begins, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The night is dark, and torrential rain beats down on the rooftops. An hour before dawn, the bell on the newly erected south gate begins to toll urgently. A cry goes up from the wall as troops dash to man their positions:
>>
>>"The dead! The dead are coming!"
>>

The Battle of Leilon has begun.

### Battlefield Events

The following events correspond to boxes marked on the Battle Flowchart.

#### Event 1. Dawn of the Dead

The battle begins when Ularan Mortus orders his ghoulish army to attack the south gate. When the party arrives on the scene, the battle is already underway. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The din of battle echoes from the palisade as you approach. Through the rain, you see allied troops using spears and bows to fend off a horde of ghouls swarming from the darkness. All along the ramparts, burning torches struggle to provide illumination for your forces. As you watch, these pools of light are extinguished one by one as the dead swarm over the walls!
>>

To triumph in this encounter, the characters must hold the line against an ever-growing horde of undead. The palisade is soon breached, so it doesn't matter whether the party faces their foes on the ramparts or inside the town: more undead are always coming!

In the first round, the players face three **ghasts** per character, including sidekicks. At start of each new round thereafter, two more ghasts per character enter the fray. To prevail, the party must hold out for 8 rounds without retreating (or 5 rounds if they successfully completed the "*Icingdeath and Twinkle*" quest). After this time, allied reinforcements rally to secure the palisade in this section and drive back the undead.

- The party holds the line. Mark one victory and advance to Event 2: "The Storm Breaks."
- The party retreats. The undead spill into the town. Proceed to Event 5: "Streets of Rage."

#### Event 2. The Storm Breaks

If the defenders hold the line, alarm bells ring out across town! Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>A man stumbles through the mud, his eyes wide with terror. You recognize him as Jack Torver, the owner of Leilon's general store.
>>
>>"Barbarians at the north gate!" he gasps. "The storm lord's berserkers! I was on my way to warn you when I saw the dead wading out of the marsh. They're attacking the quayside right now!"
>>

The players must choose what to do next: repel the cultists of Talos at the north gate, or stop the zombies from assaulting the quayside. Once the players have made their choice, Jack gives each character a *potion of healing* to aid them in the battle, and then collapses exhausted in the mud.

- The party moves to the north gate. Go to Event 3: "Against the Lightning."
- The party moves to the quayside. Go to Event 4: "Back to the Mud."

#### Event 3. Against the Lightning

The characters arrive at the north gate to find it besieged by the anchorites of Talos. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The north gate is on fire! Defenders huddle behind the palisade, not daring to peek over the parapet. Every few seconds, the gate heaves on its hinges as something heavy slams into it from the other side. From beyond, you hear the roaring of barbarians.
>>

The **anchorites of Talos** are using a battering ram to demolish the burning gate. Each time they spot a defender on the wall, the barbarians hurl *lightning bolts* at them. The players have one minute to act before the gate is destroyed and the barbarians pour through. A large force of anchorites is pressing at the gates, numbering at least a hundred. Use your judgement to resolve any plans that the players devise and award them appropriately (see "Narrative Combat").

If the gate is demolished, the players must hold the line alongside the defenders. In the first round, the players face two **anchorites of Talos** for every character in the party, including sidekicks. At the start of every round thereafter, one additional anchorite joins the conflict for every character in the party. To prevail, the party must hold out for 8 rounds without retreating (or 5 rounds if they successfully completed the "*Icingdeath and Twinkle*" quest). After this time, allied reinforcements rally to secure the palisade in this section and drive back the cultists. Regardless of how the characters fare, they hear screams from the quayside: the undead have overrun the docks!

- The party holds the line. Mark one victory and advance to Event 6: "Rolling Thunder."
- The party retreats. The cultists of Talos surge into the town. Go to Event 5: "Streets of Rage."

#### Event 4. Back to the Mud

Ularan Mortus has ordered a large force of zombies to march underwater through the marsh and invade the quayside.When the characters arrive here, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Screams echo across the quayside as zombies emerge from the mire! Defenders dash to repel the undead, but they seem unprepared for the surprise attack. As you get closer, you see a large undead figure with long fingers squatting over an upturned rowboat. A woman squirms in the mud underneath, trapped by the weight of the boat. You recognize her as Valdi Estapaar, the fisherwoman who sits on the town council!
>>

A **boneclaw** has cornered Councilor Estapaar and is preparing to slay her. Estapaar is a **veteran**, but she is currently restrained underneath the rowboat. To free the councilor, characters with a combined Strength score of 15 or higher must spend an action to heft the boat aside (if they attempt this while the boneclaw is perched on the boat, they need to muster a combined Strength score of 25 instead). At some point during the battle, the characters hear bells ringing to the north of town: the barbarians have broken through the gates!

- The party defeats the undead and rescues Valdi. The surviving defenders rally around them to hold the docks. Mark one victory and advance to Event 6: "Rolling Thunder."
- The party retreats or Valdi dies. The defenders crumble and the zombies advance into the town. Go to Event 5: "Streets of Rage."

#### Event 5. Streets of Rage

Overrun by enemies, the party retreats into Leilon's streets. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Terror grips Leilon. Townsfolk run screaming from their homes, only to be mercilessly cut down by the enemies rampaging through the streets. As you push through the panicking crowds, you see Sergeant Hazz Yorrum, commander of the town guard, shouting at a group of soldiers stationed behind a barricade.
>>
>>"Retreat! Save yourselves! Leilon is lost!"
>>

Sergeant Yorrum is a cowardly human male **guard**. The party can defy him and attempt to rally his troops, or retreat with him to the town square. If they stay, the players must describe what they say or do to rally the troops, and then make an appropriate ability check opposed by Yorrum's Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the players accrue five successes before three failures, Sergeant Yorrum flees and his troops rally against the approaching enemies.

- The party rallies the troops. Mark one victory and advance to Event 6: "Rolling Thunder."
- The party retreats or fails to rally the troops. The characters are pulled along with the crowd into the town square. Go to Event 7: "Enter the Dragon."

#### Event 6. Rolling Thunder

As the characters catch their breaths, the cultists of Talos unleash a magical storm on the town. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Word reaches you that the enemy has breached the town square and the defenders are in dire need of aid. As you prepare to respond, you hear war drums beating from just outside town. Suddenly a bolt of lightning blasts a nearby group of soldiers! The drums reach another crescendo, and a second bolt crackles from the clouds to strike the town's defenders!
>>

The party must choose whether to leave town and silence the drummers or move to reinforce the town square.

- The party attacks the drummers. Go to Event 8: "Thunder Drums."
- The party reinforces the town square. Go to Event 7: "Enter the Dragon."

#### Event 7. Enter the Dragon

The dragon attacks the forces gathered in the town square. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Chaos reigns in the town square. On one side, Leilon's defenders make a valiant stand against the invaders, while on the other, fleeing townsfolk clog the thoroughfare leading out of town. Screams of panic suddenly echo through the crowd. Looking up, you see a huge green dragon swoop out of the storm!
>>

Ularan Mortus has sent his dragon to crush his enemies. **Claugiyliamatar** is an ancient green dragon, except her breath weapon deals necrotic damage instead of poison damage as a result of **Ebondeath**'s possession. If the party has not yet silenced the drummers (see Event 8: "Thunder Drums"), the magic storm cloud above town unleashes targeted bolts of lightning during combat. At the end of each round, ask each player to roll a d20, and then roll a d20 for the dragon. Whoever gets the lowest result is targeted by the effect of a *call lightning* spell.

The dragon attacks any enemy forces gathered here, including cultists of Talos, but switches to attack the party if they present a threat. If the dragon loses over 100 hit points or is forced to use its Legendary Resistance feature more than once, it retreats into the clouds. If the dragon retreats, the defenders are inspired to turn the tide of battle against their enemies.

- The party drives off the dragon. Mark one victory and go to Event 13: "Ghost Tower."
- The party flees from the dragon. Go to Event 11: "Exodus."

#### Event 8. Thunder Drums

The party heads outside town to attack the priests playing the war drums. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The first light of dawn paints the landscape in shades of gray, yet the wind and rain are worsening. On a crag overlooking the town, a line of six savage barbarians beat out a relentless rhythm on their war drums. With each crescendo, a bolt of lightning slams into the town below!
>>

Six **wereboar** drummers perform a magical ritual to bring down lightning. Once per round, while at least one wereboar is drumming, any one of the drummers can duplicate the effect of a *call lightning* spell, except it has no limit to its range. The drummers fight until death and refuse to parley.

- The party silences the drummers. Mark one victory and go to Event 9: "Eye of the Storm."
- The party retreats. Go to Event 11: "Exodus."

#### Event 9: Eye of the Storm

As the drums fall silent, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The storm above Leilon breaks as rapidly as it began. Gazing out over the town, you see a huge green dragon land on the rooftop of the House of Thalivar. On a nearby hilltop, you spot another figure glaring at the dragon: a half-orc female dressed in boars' skins who clutches a giant hammer in her hands.
>>

Characters who played *Sleeping Dragon's Wake* recognize the figure as Fheralai Stormsworn, the Stormlord of Talos. They have an opportunity to strike against her but doing so means leaving the dragon to ravage the House of Thalivar.

- The party attacks Fheralai Stormsworn. Go to Event 10: "Champion of Storms."
- The party hunts down the dragon. Go to Event 13: "Ghost Tower."

#### Event 10: Champion of Storms

The party challenges Fheralai Stormsworn, leader of the cult of Talos.

>>A towering female half-orc stands on the hilltop. Under her boar-skin hood, you see eyes crackling with lightning.
>>
>>"You people defy me," she snarls. "Get out of my way, or I'll smash your town to twigs."
>>
>>As she speaks, scaly, draconic warriors emerge from the woods to stand at her side.
>>

Fheralai is in no mood to exchange words. The storm lord is a **war priest**, and she is accompanied by one **half-blue dragon gladiator** for every two characters in the party, including sidekicks.

- The party defeats Fheralai Stormsworn. Mark one victory and go to Event 11: "Exodus."
- The party retreats. Go to Event 11: "Exodus."

#### Event 11. Exodus

Heading deeper into town, the characters encounter an exodus of refugees. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The thoroughfare out of town is choked with townfolk fleeing Leilon. High above, the green dragon perches atop the House of Thalivar. The crowd here is panicking and people are being trampled underfoot. Peering through the press of bodies, you see the enemy advancing through the streets!
>>

The party must choose whether to cover the townsfolk's retreat or advance on the House of Thalivar to confront the dragon.

- The characters choose to cover the retreat. Go to Event 12: "Last Stand."
- The characters abandon the townsfolk. Go to Event 13: "Ghost Tower."

#### Event 12. Last Stand

The party makes a desperate stand to allow the defenders to escape. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>As your enemies close in, you position yourselves between them and the fleeing townsfolk. Their vanguard spots you through the driving rain, and they charge forward to attack!
>>

To defend the escaping townsfolk, the characters must hold the line against a large force of enemies.

![Ghostly Warrior](img/adventure/DC/013-n3ef5-ghostly-warrior.webp)

- The undead have advanced into the city. The characters face one **greater zombie** for every character in the party, including sidekicks.
- The cultists of Talos have advanced into the city. The characters face one **half-blue dragon gladiator** for every character in the party, including sidekicks.
- Both factions have invaded. Choose the faction that the party has fought the least.

To allow the townsfolk time to escape, the characters must hold out for at least 5 rounds. If they survive this long, the townsfolk get to safety, and the characters can retreat if needed.

When the encounter is resolved, count any victories scored so far:

- The characters scored fewer than three victories. They see the dragon tear down the House of Thalivar and fly away! To resolve the quest, go to Event 15: "Divine Contention."
- The players scored three or more victories. The town's archers drive the dragon away from the tower and it crash-lands inside the palisade! Go to Event 14: "Old Gnawbone."

#### Event 13. Ghost Tower

The characters arrive at the House of Thalivar to witness the dragon fighting the Swords of Leilon. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The green dragon squats on the distant roof of the House of Thalivar. As you draw closer, you see a trio of ghostly warriors locked in combat with the beast!
>>

If the players completed the "House of Thalivar Rebuilt" quest or saw the painting at Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe, they recognize the warriors as the long-dead Swords of Leilon! Mysteriously, Aubrey the shopkeeper is fighting alongside them. Before reading further, count any victories scored so far:

***The party achieved three or more victories.*** Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>One of the warriors, a dark-skinned woman dressed in chainmail, swings her sword at the dragon. The beast howls in pain and for a moment, you see the spectral form of another dragon seethe under its skin. The woman glances down at you as she readies her next attack.
>>
>>"To arms!" she shouts. "Leilon needs you!"
>>

**Claugiyliamatar** is an ancient green dragon, except her breath weapon deals necrotic damage instead of poison damage as a result of **Ebondeath**'s possession, and she has only 192 hit points. During combat, the Swords of Leilon intervene to aid the party, granting advantage to up to three characters' attacks each round. If the dragon drops to 50 or fewer hit points, it flies off and crashes in the nearby streets. Go to Event 14: "Old Gnawbone."

***The party achieved fewer than three victories.*** Read the following aloud:

>>Before you can act, the dragon extends a ghostly claw from its body and snatches a glowing red stone from the air above its head. With a triumphant roar, it kicks back from the tower, causing the building to collapse in a shower of dust and rubble! As the smoke clears, you see the dragon gliding away over the distant hills.
>>

**Ebondeath** has escaped with the *ruinstone* and the Swords of Leilon are lost. To resolve the quest, go to Event 15: "Divine Contention."

#### Event 14. Old Gnawbone

The characters corner the dragon where it crashed in the ruined streets of Leilon. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The dragon has crash-landed on Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe, reducing the building to a pile of broken masonry. Bleeding badly and covered with arrows, the dragon struggles to rise to its feet. As you approach it, the specter of another dragon emerges from its body and flies away to the south, fading from sight! As the spirit leaves its body, the dragon slumps exhausted to the ground.
>>

**Ebondeath**'s spirit has fled its host body, leaving Claugiyliamatar weakened and vulnerable. The characters can slay the dragon here, or at your discretion, negotiate terms for her surrender. **Claugiyliamatar** is an ancient green dragon, but she has only 50 hit points and all her attacks are made at disadvantage due to her exhausted state. If the party survives, mark **one victory** and proceed to "Conclusion."

#### Event 15. Divine Contention

As **Ebondeath**'s spirit departs with the *ruinstone*, the characters gain an opportunity to strike at Ularan Mortus. Read the following aloud:

>>A baleful horn sounds over the town and the undead begin to shamble back into the marsh. As they withdraw, you spot a black-robed figure on a skeletal horse watching the town from a nearby hilltop.
>>

The players can attack Ularan Mortus if they dare. If they hold back, the figure rides away and the battle ends here: proceed to "Conclusion." Read the following boxed text aloud if the characters ascend the hill:

>>It seems you aren't the only ones to take your chances with the necromancer. As you ascend to the top of the hill, you see a magical duel raging around the rider! Barbaric half-orcs hurl bolts of lightning and dead men snarl as they fight each other.
>>

Ularan Mortus and his undead entourage face an elite squad of cultists. If Fheralai Stormsworn still lives, she is fighting here too.

- Ularan Mortus and Fheralai Stormsworn are both **war priests**.
- Ularan Mortus has one **ghast** on his side per character in the party, including sidekicks.
- Fheralai Stormsworn has one **anchorite of Talos** for every two characters in the party, including sidekicks.

The villains fight to the death. If the party survives, the battle ends here. Mark **one victory** and proceed to "Conclusion."

### Conclusion

If the characters survive and save Leilon, they become heroes of the town. The councilors raise statues in the characters' honor, though they remain fearful of the rising cult activity in the area. In time, Lord Neverember asks the characters to stamp out these threats once and for all by striking at the cults' headquarters. This unlocks the final two quests: "*Ebondeath's Mausoleum*" and "*Storm Lord's Hideout*."

If **Claugiyliamatar** surrendered, she ends up indebted to the characters. The old wyrm is evil and untrustworthy, but a dragon's oath is still worth something. At your discretion, the characters could call upon Old Gnawbone's aid in their coming adventures.

Finally, an odd thing happens as the characters return to town. During the clean-up, the characters discover that nobody in town has ever heard of Aubrey's Peculiarities ShoppeÃ¢ÂÂperhaps it was crushed by the dragon and nobody seems to care, or the characters mention seeing Aubrey fighting atop the tower and nobody remembers who he is. Visiting the site of his store, they see that the building was never actually restored from its ancient state. All that remains in the rubble is the dusty triptych of the Swords of LeilonÃ¢ÂÂonly now, the third member of the group, Aubrey himself, is visible in the portrait.

# Storm Lord's Hideout

"Storm Lord's Hideout" is balanced for characters of 12th level. Players who've run the second part of this trilogy, *Sleeping Dragon's Wake*, will be familiar with Fheralai Stormsworn's headquarters: the undead galleon she stole from Ularan Mortus. This time around, they're not the only ones seeking revenge!

## Location Overview

Fheralai Stormsworn, champion of the cult of Talos, commandeered this galleon from the dread cultist Ularan Mortus. The ship is imbued with the undead spirit of the death knight Emberlost, which is bound into the cursed bones that comprise the vessel.

Emberlost's mournful spirit yearns for Anauria, a city long since swallowed up by the Anauroch Desert, and it gladly serves anyone who can rekindle its memories of its lost homeland. In the second part of this trilogy, *Sleeping Dragon's Wake*, Fheralai lost her hold over the ship when the party rescued the bard Tarbin Tul from a brig below decks. Fheralai has since appeased Emberlost's spirit by bringing it treasures from the lost city of Anauria, which she stole from the auction houses of Neverwinter. Now her cultists ply the oceans for more plunder.

Following the attack on Leilon, Lord Protector Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter offers a purse of 8,000 gp to anyone who can track down the undead galleon and sink it to the bottom of the Sea of Swords.Fheralai's failure to capture Leilon and defeat Ularan Mortus has also angered Talos, and the Stormlord means to punish them.

## Travel to the Ship

The undead galleon sails up and down the Sword Coast, preying on merchant ships. While moving, it hides within a magical fogbank that moves with it. To catch the ship, the party first needs to acquire a means of transportation:

- Characters who played the "*Icingdeath and Twinkle*" quest can call on either captain to help them. For a cut of 20% of the 8,000 gp reward, the captain offers the services of his ship and crew.
- The characters can hire or buy a ship from the shipyards of Neverwinter. *chapter 5* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* contains rules for maritime vessels and a breakdown of their costs.
- Characters who spared the green dragon Claugiyliamatar in the "*Leilon Besieged*" quest could compel her to fly them out to sea. She refuses to fight on their behalf but gladly transports the party to repay her debt.
- Spells such as wind walk or polymorph can grant flight for a limited duration.

Finding the ship isn't easy. Characters must use divination magic to locate it, lure it into a trap, or scour the coastal taverns for rumors of its location. Let your players hatch their own plots and reward them accordingly. Once you (the DM) have decidedthe party knows where to look, introduce the following encounters on route.

### Roc Patrol

As the weather worsens, a **roc** swoops down from the storm clouds above. On its back, a half-orc **blackguard** (see *appendix A*) named Kata Ironhide spits threats at the party. Kata is a loyal cultist of Talos and has orders to scare away potential threats to the galleon. During combat, the roc tries to snatch opponents into the air and drop them (creatures hitting the surface of the water from lower than 50 feet take half the normal falling damage). If Kata or her roc lose more than half of their hit points, they attempt to flee back to the galleon.

### Tornado

When the party nears the galleon, the cultists call upon Talos to ravage the intruders with a tornado. Before the twister appears, high winds savage the party: if traveling by ship, the characters must take action to avoid getting damaged by the storm (see the "*Icingdeath and Twinkle*" quest for examples). At the height of the storm, the characters see a tornado bearing down on them. Ask each player how they mean to evade this threat. If traveling by ship, whoever is steering the vessel needs to succeed on three consecutive DC 18 Dexterity checks using proficiency with water vehicles (other actions taken to aid the escape may grant advantage at your discretion). On a failure of two consecutive sailing checks the ship is swept up by the tornado and destroyed: all creatures onboard take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage and are tossed into the sea.

## Arrival

The undead galleon is surrounded by a 500-foot-radius fogbank at the eye of the storm. Entering this area, the wind drops to a dead calm and vision is restricted to just 10 feet. Ships that rely on wind for maneuvering are cast adrift, unless they also have oar decks and the crew to man them. The dreadnaught dwells at the heart of the fogbank, its location hinted at by the thundering drums from its oar deck.

The death knight dreadnaught can perceive through the magical fog, but its crew cannot. If the dreadnaught sights an unknown ship, it tries to ambush and ram the vessel. The attack is designed to strike terror into its enemies: first by striking their main deck with a blast from its Hellfire Orb, and then by ramming into their flank so to the dreadnaught's skeletal figurehead can mop up any crew left alive on deck (see "Dreadnaught Locations" for information on both these defenses). Characters whose ship was destroyed earlier are instead "rescued" by the galleon.

When the characters sight the vessel, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>An armored dreadnaught made from metal and bones ploughs through the fog, driven by banks of bonelike oars. Flames leap from a brazier mounted to its mainmast and its ragged sails are stitched from worn leather. A giant's skeleton clutching a halberd is lashed to its bow.
>>

The cultists of Talos onboard the vessel fight to the death to defend it. However, the storm god Talos has his own plans for them. When the time seems right, he makes his presence known (see "Rise of the Storm Lord").

### Death Knight's Soul

The soul of the death knight Emberlost is bound into the dreadnaught's bones. As a sentient, undead creature, Emberlost can see and talk through the skeletal figurehead (*area D2*), his own corpse below deck (*area D17*), or the hellfire orb mounted on the mainmast (*area D3*). The death knight has Wisdom (Perception) modifier of +3 and a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 13.

> ##### Dreadnaught Features
>
>The death knight-dreadnaught is a galleon crafted from humanoid bones bound together by plates of iron and necromantic magic.
>
>***Ceilings.*** The lower decks of the vessel are cramped, with ceilings just six feet high. Creatures taller than this height must stoop to get around.

>***Light.*** The lower decks are lit by oil lamps that burn with eerie green flames. These cast dim light throughout the vessel's interior, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

>***Unholy Presence.*** The dreadnaught is imbued with the cursed soul of a death knight. All undead creatures onboard the vessel or within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

![Map 6: Storm Lord's Hideout](img/adventure/DC/014-cvtwd-map-stormlordshideout_dm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/DC/015-en4hl-map-stormlordshideout_player.webp)
### Dreadnaught Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map of the death knight-dreadnaught.

#### D1. Skeletal Figurehead

The animated skeleton of a stone giant is lashed to the ship's bow. This creature has the statistics of a **giant skeleton** (see *appendix A*) that cannot move and uses the following attack in place of a scimitar:

**Halberd**. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit*: 21 (3d10 + 5) slashing damage.

Once per day, the skeleton can use its action to unleash a *lightning bolt* from its halberd, as though cast using a 5th-level spell slot.

The evil spirit of the death knight can see and speak through the skeletal figurehead (see "Death Knight's Soul").

#### D2. Upper Deck

The upper deck contains a set of stairs that descend into the bowels of the ship, two ballista mounted on rotating platforms, two rear-facing mangonels (see "*Siege Equipment*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*), and hatches that open into the ship's stores and artillery magazine. The hatch to the stores can only be opened by creatures with a combined Strength score of 18 or more.

While hidden in the fog cloud, the cultists abandon the siege weapons and stay below deck. Instead, a group of **wraiths** defend the upper decks. The players face one wraith per character in the party, including sidekicks.

***Treasure.*** A large roc's nest is nestled at the back of the main deck. Characters who search through the bones strewn throughout the nest discover a battered *helm of telepathy* and five black pearls worth 500 gp each.

#### D3. Hellfire Orb

The iron brazier mounted on the mainmast contains an ever-burning orb of flame. The spirit of the death knight can see and talk through this orb, perceiving its surroundings with darkvision to a range of 120 feet (see "Death Knight's Soul"). Once per day, the death knight can hurl a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 240 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### D4. Shrine to Talos

This was once the ship's chart room, but the compartment has been gutted and turned into a shrine to Talos. Charred skulls are heaped around an upright iron spike topped with three crudely hammered bolts of lightning.

***Treasure.*** Five ornate silvered hunting horns have been laid out here as offerings to Talos. Each horn is worth 250 gp. Any character who takes a horn hears a rumble of thunder as they pick it up. When Talos attacks the ship, these characters won't find it so easy to escape (see "Rise of the Storm Lord").

#### D5. Storage Lockers

These lockers contain supplies for manning the vessel: spare rope, buckets, tubs of grease, and other mundane tools. A character who hides inside a locker gains advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to evade the crew.

#### D6. Captain's Cabin

This cabin belongs to Fheralai Stormsworn. Bearskin throws cover the floor and the walls are decorated with the mounted, charred heads of her enemies.

If Fheralai survived the "*Leilon Besieged*" quest, the defeated **war priest** is found kneeling in here, praying to Talos through the dregs of a bottle of rum. Having failed her mission, the champion begs her deity's forgiveness. Fheralai has no fear of death but is terrified of failing Talos: if the characters enter her cabin, she chooses to drunkenly unload the details of her plight rather than fight them. Did she not honor her god with chaos and ruin? Were her conquests not glorious? Fheralai begs the party for advice on how she should confess her failures to her god: if they ridicule her or show defiance, she throws herself at them in a fight to the death. Players who negotiate get to see first-hand how Talos responds to their advice (see "Rise of the Storm Lord").

***Treasure.*** The following treasures looted from Fheralai's raids are dumped carelessly around her cabin: 1,500 gp, a 2-foot-tall solid gold bull statue worth 3,500 gp, two crystal decanters worth 500 gp each, 5 *potions of greater healing*, a *spell scroll* of *chain lightning*, and four *javelins of lightning*.

#### D7. Oar Deck

This gloomy oar deck looks like the belly of a whale, with gargantuan ribs sweeping from the walls to form rowing benches for the undead crew. The deck underfoot is littered with humanoid bones to a depth of 1 foot. Two large, unmanned drums are positioned to the rear of the deck.

A rowing crew of fifty **skeletons** pull the oars in here. Two skeleton drummers beat out a rowing rhythm on pair of bone drums. The undead attack any intruders who enter here.

#### D8. Ironhide's Cabin

This cabin belongs to Stormsworn's current second-in-command, Kata Ironhide, who spends most of her time patrolling the skies on her pet roc (see "Travel to the Ship"). The cabin contains little more than her own bed, a "nest" made from the bones of her enemies.

***Treasure.*** Ironhide keeps a bandolier hung on the door containing 3 *potions of greater healing* and a *potion of invulnerability*. Her nest contains a polished adamantine mirror decorated with gold filigree worth 850 gp.

#### D9. Magazine

This chamber holds iron balls, ballista bolts, and rocks for the vessel's siege weaponry. A 20-foot-high shaft ascends from here to the poop deck (area D7), where a bucket and chain dangle from a winch. A character can climb the chain to ascend to the poop deck.

#### D10. Crew Quarters

String hammocks are strung up here like cobwebs. Due to the awkwardness of this space, any Medium or larger creature fighting in here counts as squeezing into a smaller space (see "*Creature Size*" in chapter 9 of the *Player's Handbook*).

This area, including cabins *D15* and *D16*, is guarded by the last of Fheralai's cultists. The players encounter one **blackguard** plus two **anchorites of Talos** for every character in the party, including sidekicks. The cultists fight to the death.

#### D11. Galley

The galley contains workspaces for preparing food and stores of spices and dried herbs.

#### D12. Surgery

This area was used to treat the sick. The cultists have little use for it now, as any cultists who fall ill are lashed to the mast during a storm and told to beg Talos's forgiveness for their body's weakness.

#### D13. Death Knight's Soul

The corpse of a knight wearing plate armor slumps on a throne at the rear of this compartment. The ship's bones spill from the knight's chest and are entwined with his body, fusing him to the vessel. This is the death knight Emberlost, and his corpse houses the cursed soul of the dreadnaught. Emberlost can talk through the corpse and see through its eyes, but can't animate it. If anyone touches the corpse or strikes it with a melee weapon attack, Emberlost withdraws his body into the hull, swallowing it in bones.

***Treasures.*** Emberlost is surrounded by plundered treasures from the lost city of Anauria, which Fheralai recently stole from the auction houses of Neverwinter. The hoard includes four black opals worth 1,000 gp each, a golden harp worth 750 gp, an ornamental swan worth 500 gp, a jewel-encrusted dagger worth 750 gp, and a treasure chest containing 8,000 gp.

#### D14. Stores

The dreadnaught's stores contain mundane supplies for the journey: barrels of salted meat, cords of wood, nails, and cloth.

#### D15. Prisoner Cell

This cell is used to hold captives. It is presently unoccupied.

#### D16. Armory

This armory contains racks of maces, spears, and hammers for use by the ship's crew.

#### D17. Flooded Hold

The hold is unlit and flooded to a depth of 3 feet with dark, briny water.

### Rise of the Storm Lord

The god of storms is furious with Fheralai for failing him and has sworn to punish her cult. When the time seems right to introduce Talos, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Bolts of lightning lash from the heavens, sizzling on the surface of the sea. Through the crackling electricity, a giant figure emerges from the churning water: a muscular man wearing half-plate armor and a stitched leather eyepatch.
>>
>>"You have failed your lord!" he cries in a voice that shakes the heavens.
>>

Faced with a god, any cultists of Talos still alive prostrate themselves on the decks, and even the undead withdraw back into the ship. If Fheralai Stormsworn still lives, Talos demands that she explains her failures to him. If the party advised her on what to say to her god, she may have a chance to placate himÃ¢ÂÂat your discretion! Talos gladly immolates her with a stroke of lightning if she lacks the words to appease him.

Regardless of Fheralai's own survival, Talos punishes her crew by summoning a horde of air elementals to wreck the vessel.The players face one **air elemental myrmidon** per character in the party, including sidekicks, although many more myrmidons are summoned to destroy the rest of the crew! If Fheralai still lives, she fights alongside the party to prove herself to her god. The goal in this final battle is to escape the vessel: make it clear to the players that escaping the ship is their only option here! If they survive, they see Talos tear the dreadnaught to shreds before he dives back under the waves.

### Conclusion

Characters who make it back to shore can report the sinking of the ship to the authorities in Neverwinter, who award them their purse of 8,000 gp. If this is the last follow-up quest they've played, their adventure ends here (see "*Ending the Adventure*" for more information).

# Thalivar's Beacon

"Thalivar's Beacon" is balanced for characters of 11th level. Players who've run the first part of this trilogy, *Storm Lord's Wrath***, will be familiar with the tower and its inhabitants.

## Location Overview

The wizard Thalivar built a tower at the heart of Leilon as a laboratory to study the monsters of the cosmos. Using a device called a planar beacon, Thalivar lured his prey into the tower and trapped them for his experiments. Disaster struck when Thalivar tried using the beacon to acquire a planar artifact called the *ruinstone* and accidentally unleashed the contents of his own menagerie. For years, the House of Thalivar stood abandoned, and those who dared to enter it were lost forever.

When the Spellplague wracked Toril, the cursed magic of the beacon was turned outwards on the town, and the monsters lurking within the tower were released. A local adventuring party, the Swords of Leilon, died trying to stop them from spilling out into the town below. Since then, the tower has been haunted by the ghosts of those who died within.

Led by the wizard Gallio Elibro, forces from Neverwinter have recently rebuilt the tower for use as a garrison building. Gallio has repaired the planar beacon and is continuing Thalivar's research into the planes. With the town threatened by invasion, the wizard offers to aid the party by summoning a cadre of bound monsters to defend the walls. Secretly, he has other motives in mind....

### Quest Goals

To complete the Thalivar's Beacon quest (see "The Quest Board"), the adventurers must defeat Gallio's extraplanar monsters when they accidentally go on the rampage.

## Travel to the Tower

The House of Thalivar perches on a rocky crag in the center of town. A recently paved trail winds up through shrubs to the foot of the tower.

## Arrival

When the characters arrive at the tower, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The House of Thalivar is a tall tower at the heart of the town. Recently rebuilt by soldiers, the structure now serves as a garrison for Neverwinter's soldiery. Ravens circle the tower's pointed roof and warm lantern light shines from its windows. At its foot, two arched doorways open into the interior.
>>

A company of fifteen **guards** inhabit the tower, led by the wizard Gallio Elibro and his guard captain Hazz Yarrum. Two halflings serve the household as cooks and porters. Refer to "Meeting Gallio Elibro" when the characters present themselves for their quest.

### Meeting Gallio Elibro

Gallio Elibro is a short-tempered Rashemi human male **mage** (with the *legend lore* spell prepared instead of *cone of cold*). Characters who played the first part of this trilogy, *Storm Lord's Wrath*, likely saved Gallio when Thalivar's restless spirit possessed him. If Gallio died during that quest, replace him with one of his colleagues from the Order of the Many-Starred Cloak.

Gallio meets the party in the building's entry hall and escorts them to his laboratory on the third floor, where he explains the mission:

- Gallio has recently repaired Thalivar's planar beacon and is using it to trap and bind monsters from beyond this plane of existence.
- Once bound, such monsters could serve as useful tools if the town is invaded. However, Gallio needs the characters' help to trap more of them.
- Gallio wants the characters to travel with him into the Ethereal Plane and lure the monsters into the spectral light of the planar beacon.

Gallio can answer any questions the players have about the history of the tower or the mission at hand (see "Into the Ethereal").

> ##### Gallio's Hidden Agenda
>
>Gallio has secret orders from his superiors in the Order of the Many-Starred Cloak to recover a magical artifact called the *ruinstone* from the Ethereal Plane. He intends to use the party to lure the *ruinstone's* guardians away, allowing him to seize it for his studies. Gallio doesn't know that the artifact is protected by a field of wild magic. Touching it unleashes a magical backlash that overloads the planar beacon and frees any monsters held inside the tower: the same fate that befell Thalivar.

> ##### Tower Features
>
>The House of Thalivar is an 80-foot-tall stone tower that serves as a garrison for Leilon's soldiery. Its common features are described below.
>
>***Ceilings.*** Ceilings inside the tower are 20 feet high and vaulted.

>***Light.*** By day, sunlight floods the tower through its many high windows. Areas without natural light are well lit by wall lanterns.

>***Doors.*** Doors are made of wood and kept locked. A locked door can be opened with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A locked door can be opened as an action with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. All the guards carry keys for the doors, although only Gallio carries keys for the rooms on the third and fourth floors.

### Thalivar's Beacon Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map of the House of Thalivar.

#### B1. Tower Exterior

The tower rests on a rocky plateau. A grand portico once abutted the building to the west, but it fell long ago and only a few broken arches of masonry remain. Arched doorways lead into the entry hall.

#### B2. Entry Hall

A large banquet table rests on the floor in here. The guards use this chamber as a mess hall and meeting room. Guests are also entertained here.

#### B3. Supply Room

This chamber contains supplies for the upkeep of the tower: mops, coils of rope, timber, boxes filled with nails, and cleaning supplies.

#### B4. Kitchen

The kitchen is in use most hours of the day, as halfling cook Tombil Breen prepares food for over a dozen residents. A large cooking pot of stew bubbles away over the hearth.

#### B5. Servant's Quarters

These cozy quarters contain beds for the tower's two servants, halfling cook Tombil Breen and his brother Tug. The adjoining storage closet houses a small shrine to Cyrrollalee, halfling god of home and friendship.

#### B6. Garrison

These rooms contain bunks for the tower's soldiers. Foot lockers at the end of the bunks hold each soldier's meager possessions: letters from Neverwinter, tobacco, hipflasks of rum, and other personal effects.

#### B7. Armory

The armory contains racks of longswords, spears, light crossbows, and crossbow bolts: enough to arm a levy army of a hundred warriors. Three suits of full plate armor rest on dummies by the western wall.

***Weapons Locker.*** This locker is reinforced with a superior lock. To open this door, a character must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or force it open as an action with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.Inside, a *longsword of warning* named Auspex is mounted to the wall.

#### B8. Guard Room

The soldiers relax in this chamber when they're not on duty, wiling away their downtime by playing cards, drinking, or singing. There are 1d4 + 2 guards in here at any time of the day or night.

#### B9. Yurrum's Office

This office belongs to Hazz Yurrum, the ineffective sergeant of the soldiers. Yurrum is a cowardly human **guard**. His desk contains maps of the region and reports to his superiors with inflated accounts of his own prowess. A portrait of Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter, hangs on the wall, pockmarked with darts. Sergeant Yurrum flips the portrait to face the wall if he knows he has guests coming.

#### B10. Laboratory

The laboratory is crammed with tables bearing alchemical gear. Bottles of rare ingredients line the walls, alongside strange trinkets and stuffed oddities acquired from other worlds. If combat occurs here, any creature that misses with a melee weapon attack must roll a d20 on the Alchemical Mishaps table.

##### Alchemical Mishaps
|  d20  | Mishap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:-----:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1-2  | Explosion. All creatures within 10 feet of the character must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.                                           |
|  3-5  | Reversed Gravity. Gravity reverses in a 20-foot-radius sphere around the character. Any creatures in this area fall upwards, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage as they crash headfirst into the ceiling. This effect lasts for 1d3 rounds. |
|  6-9  | Flashbang. All creatures within 10 feet of the character must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they are blinded and deafened until the end of their next turn.                                                |
| 10-20 | No effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### B11. Gallio's Study

Gallio sleeps in here, surrounded by books he acquired from Thalivar's library. The room contains a bed, a closet, and many bookshelves. A letter on the desk contains Gallio's orders from the Many-Starred Cloak, which instruct him to "recover the ruinstone from the tower's ethereal spire."

#### B12. Library

The library contains dozens of tomes covering a variety of esoteric subjects: magic, alchemy, religion, and the cosmos.

#### B13. Planar Beacon

This room is dominated by the planar beacon: a 5-foot-high, egg-shaped geode mounted on a rotating bronze pedestal and enclosed within a crystal cylinder. A large silver bell is mounted to a wall bracket near the room's entrance.

***Dimensional Cells.*** Eight barred cells line the chamber's walls. While the beacon turns, creatures held inside these cells are prevented from taking any form of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to another plane of existence.Bending the bars of a cell requires success on a DC 25 Strength check. The cell doors spring open automatically if the beacon is disabled. Two paralyzed **star spawn manglers** (see *appendix A*) occupy the cells when the characters first enter the tower.

#### B14. Ethereal Spire

Thalivar built this spire long ago, but it collapsed when the town fell into ruin. Its lingering form remains on the Border Ethereal, where it appears as any other structure from the Material Plane: ghostly and immaterial. A group of four **star spawn manglers** (see *appendix A*) lurk in the mists surrounding this chamber and attack anyone who enters.

The only object of interest here is the *ruinstone* a fiery red crystal the size of a human palm, which is clasped in the maw of a snake-shaped pedestal. The pedestal is enchanted and only releases its prize if a long-forgotten command word is spoken. Any creature that touches the *ruinstone* or strikes the pedestal with a melee weapon must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 hour. This magical backlash also disables the planar beacon.The pedestal has AC 10, 50 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

> ##### The Ruinstone
>
>This evil artifact was created by Netherese wizards long ago. Once per day, a creature holding the *ruinstone* can use it to undo one action they performed within the past 24 hours, altering reality so that any consequences of that action are erased. For example, a creature could undo the killing blow that they dealt to an enemy, causing that enemy to return to life in the position where it died. Each use of the artifact has a terrible side effect: one random person known to the user is also erased from reality. The villains in this adventure both want to acquire the *ruinstone* for their own evil ends. If your players decide to claim it themselves, it's up to you to determine what calamities befall them!
>

## Into the Ethereal

Assuming the characters agree to the quest, Gallio leads them upstairs to the planar beacon on the fourth floor (area B13), where he performs a ten-minute ritual to transport the party to the Ethereal Plane.

Before beginning his ritual, Gallio shows the characters the monsters held in his dimensional cells. He reveals that the planar beacon freezes any extraplanar beings caught in its beam: to bring the monsters home, the characters must grab hold of them, then return to this world and imprison the monster inside one of his dimensional cells.

### The Ritual

To perform the ritual, Gallio paints a magic rune on each character's forehead and chants an incantation to draw upon the power of the planar beacon. When the ritual is complete, Gallio asks each character to ring the silver bell mounted on the wall. As they do so, they fade from sight and are transported into the Ethereal Plane. Read the following boxed text aloud when a character first rings the bell.

>>As the silver bell is struck, the world fades away. Grey mist swirls into view and the temperature drops to a soul-chilling cold. Your companions and the tower you just stood in remain visible, but appear translucent and oddly distant. In this strange world, a beam of blue light spills from the planar beacon and sweeps around it in a circle, like a spectral lighthouse. Most mysterious of all, a spiral staircase rises from an archway in the wall that wasn't present before.
>>

Anyone who rings the bell enters the Border Ethereal as though affected by an *etherealness* spell. The effect lasts for 24 hours, during which time a character can pass back and forth between worlds by ringing the silver bell, which exists in both planes simultaneously. When all the characters have passed through, Gallio rings the bell to join them.

### Hunting for Star Spawn

Gallio leads the characters upstairs to the mysterious chamber at the top of the ethereal spire (area B14). As they approach the chamber, Gallio casts a *greater invisibility* spell on himself and instructs the characters to lure the monsters within into the planar beacon. When the characters enter the room, the monsters emerge from the mists to attack them. Any interplanar creature that starts its turn inside the planar beacon room (area B13) is paralyzed for one minute. If a character grabs a paralyzed monster and then rings the silver bell, they can drag the creature back to the Material Plane and imprison it inside one of the dimensional cells.

While the characters are dealing with the monsters, Gallio tries to unlock the *ruinstone* from its pedestal. After 5 rounds, he grabs hold of the stone and tries to remove it by force. Read the following boxed text aloud when this occurs:

>>Gallio screams from the top of the astral spire. A shockwave washes through the mists, and the spectral light of the planar beacon flickers and dies. Looking back into your own world, you see the trapped monsters awaken and break free from their cells!
>>

Touching the *ruinstone* triggers a magical backlash that disables the planar beacon and frees any creatures trapped in its spell. Back on the Material Plane, any captured monsters break free from their cells and rampage through the tower, including the two that Gallio captured previously. To complete their quest, the characters must hunt down and kill the monsters. If they succeed, proceed to "Conclusion."

### Conclusion

If the characters defeat the star spawn, they discover Gallio's unconscious body sprawled before the *ruinstone*. When they approach the body, the ghosts of the Swords of Leilon appear to issue a warning. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>A pair of ghostly figures emerge from the mists: a dark-skinned warrior woman dressed in chainmail, and a red-bearded dwarf carrying a lute. The woman holds up her hand in a sign of peace and speaks in an echoing voice.
>>
>>"This is what happens to those who meddle with the ruinstone. Leave it here, lest the people of Leilon suffer its wrath once more!"
>>

The **ghosts** can reveal the following information:

- In life, the ghosts belonged to an adventuring company called the Swords of Leilon. The woman was once called Augusta Krul and the dwarf was known as Ogri Ninebeards.
- When the wizard Thalivar accidentally released the monsters trapped in his tower, the Swords of Leilon fought and died to hold them back.
- Thalivar spent all his life searching for an artifact called the ruinstone. When he finally touched it, its magic broke his planar beacon and released his monsters.
- The ghosts have sensed that evil powers have recently learned of the stone and are conspiring to claim it. It must not fall into evil hands!

The ghosts urge the characters to help them protect the stone. If a living humanoid willingly binds their soul to the *ruinstone*, the artifact will be destroyed when it's next usedÃ¢ÂÂbut doing so erases the soul from existence. Any creature that binds its soul to the artifact suffers no ill effects until the artifact is used, at which point the creature disappears from reality and can only be brought back with a *wish* spell, or similar magic. If no characters are willing to volunteer their souls, the ghosts ask them to stay clear of the tower and leave them to guard it.

When Gallio awakens, he admits to his deception and swears never to seek the *ruinstone* again. The wizard resigns from his post at once and returns to Neverwinter to face his order.

# Ending the Adventure

The adventure ends when the players have completed both the follow-up quests and put an end to the rival cults threatening Leilon. The characters should now be now 13th level. Give your players a chance to celebrate their victory: a feast in Leilon, or the trust of Lord Protector Neverember. If the characters saved Leilon, the party is remembered forevermore as their saviors.

If the worst happens and the characters die, their adventure is also over. You can let the players roll up new characters and pick up where the last ones left off, or you can also start the adventure over with new characters, tweaking quests as you see fit to surprise players who might be familiar with them.

You might expand the adventure by inventing new quests and new locations. Several other D&D adventures, *Out of the Abyss*, *Princes of the Apocalypse*, *Rise of Tiamat*, and *Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage*, take place in the Forgotten Realms and include challenges for characters of 11th and higher level.

# Appendix B: Sidekicks

This appendix presents the game statistics for sidekicks, of which there are three types:

- **Expert**, an agile and exceedingly helpful jack of all trades
- **Spellcaster**, a magic-user who can cast spells to harm your foes or heal you and your friends
- **Warrior**, a martial companion who specializes in striking your foes or defending you and your allies

You can tell the players which type of sidekick to use or let the players choose. It's up to you and the players to decide who controls the sidekick in play.

If the characters have already played through *Storm Lord's Wrath* or *Sleeping Dragon's Wake*, they can use the same sidekicks from that adventure. This appendix can also help you level up those sidekicks.
