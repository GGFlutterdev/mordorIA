# Hunt for Mage Tower

In this adventure, the characters return to Strixhaven University as second-year students. As the year gets underway, the characters' peers urge them to form a team and compete in a high-profile game of Mage Tower. They'll investigate the odd behavior of the magical creatures at the game's center while they prepare for the big game. And throughout the year, nefarious forces strew havoc across the campusÃ¢ÂÂright up to the characters' fateful game day at Strixhaven Stadium. Will the characters unveil and thwart the threats before something terrible befalls the event?

## Running This Adventure

Here's what you need to know to run the adventure in this chapter, whether you're running it as part of a campaign or as a standalone adventure.

### Character Advancement

This adventure assumes the characters are 4th level when it begins. The Second-Year Level Advancement table summarizes when the characters gain levels during the adventure.

##### Second-Year Level Advancement
| Level | Reached When Characters...                       |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 5th   | Complete the first Scrivening and Symbology Exam |
| 6th   | Finish the adventure                             |

### Choosing a College

Before this adventure begins, the characters must choose one of Strixhaven's five colleges to join: Silverquill, Prismari, Witherbloom, Lorehold, or Quandrix. This choice can happen "off screen" or as part of the preparation for this adventure. See *chapter 1* for more information about joining a Strixhaven college and the academic counselors assigned to students in their second year.

### Adventure Overview

The dangerous events the characters face in this adventure are the work of two **mage hunters**Ã¢ÂÂvicious monsters described in *chapter 7*. The mastermind **Murgaxor** Grenshel has bent these creatures to his will as part of his effort to weaken Strixhaven and achieve immortality.

#### A Standalone Adventure

If you're running this adventure as a standalone, the mage hunters are acting independently, not as part of **Murgaxor**'s schemes. These creatures have broken from their Oriq associates and enacted their own scheme to weaken Strixhaven. Believing their success will earn them a place of prestige among the university's enemies, they plot to bring down Strixhaven's newest star pupils: the characters.

### Random Encounters

Use the Second-Year Encounters table for random encounters on campus during this adventure.

## Back in Session

Once the characters have chosen their colleges and cemented their other second-year decisions, it's time to kick off this adventure.

![](img/book/SCC/069-04-002.ticket.webp)

The academic year has barely dawned when the characters wrap up a day of their new courses and head toward Bow's End Tavern on the central campus for some socializing.

In this scene, the characters learn about the Battle of Strixhaven, a Mage Tower game. Another student is part of this sceneÃ¢ÂÂideally a student the characters have interacted with, or you may choose another student from the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3*.

When you're ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following, altering the text to incorporate the student's name or other details:

>>Your peers' shouts of camaraderie punctuate the air as you finish your first second-year classes for the day. Nearby you see Bow's End Tavern, where you'll find friends waiting.
>>

A student runs up to the characters, shouting and waving a flyer. Pausing to catch their breath, the student grins and stuffs the flyer in a character's hand. The student exclaims:

>>"It's happeningÃ¢ÂÂthe Mage Tower game! The professors invited the student body to field two Mage Tower teams for a game at the end of the year. It's the Battle of Strixhaven, and the winners and their supporters get bragging rights for life! All of us think you'd make the best team. You'd win for sure!
>>
>>"If you're in, you can register your team with Professor Sharpbeak. Come onÃ¢ÂÂwe'll talk you into it over Curtie's caster's stew!"
>>

Show the players the Battle of Strixhaven flyer. As Strixhaven students, the characters are familiar with the game Mage Tower. Share the information below with the players.

### The Game of Mage Tower

Mage Tower is one of Strixhaven's most common student games. The Battle of Strixhaven is an intramural championship held every three years in Strixhaven Stadium for bragging rights among the student body. For more about this event, see the "*Battle of Strixhaven*" section.

#### Mage Tower's Rules

Here are the rules of Mage Tower:

- Each of the two teams has an equal number of students, usually not exceeding five.
- Each team is represented by a small mascot creature that reflects one of Strixhaven's colleges, as described in the "*Mascots*" section of *chapter 1*.
- When the game begins, the two mascots are placed on high towers at opposite ends of the field of play.
- Each team tries to steal the opposing mascot and transport it back to the tower at their end of the field. Doing so scores one point.
- The game occurs in three phases of 20 minutes each.
- The team that scores the most points by the end of the third phase wins the game.
- Anything that could cause damage to a participant, mascot, or spectator or that would damage the field of play in any way is prohibited. Breaking this rule results in expulsion from the game.
- Questionable use of magic can be called as a foul by the game's referee. A faculty member fills that post during official games.
- Participants who accumulate three fouls are ejected from the game. Teams may not replace participants who foul out.

### Forming a Team

Once the characters decide to form one of the two Mage Tower teams for the Battle of Strixhaven, they must register the team with Professor Mavinda Sharpbeak (campus counselor and owlin **Silverquill professor of radiance**; see *chapter 7*). Their team includes all the characters; the characters might recruit student NPCs to join their team, although filling their roster up to five participants isn't required. The opposing team has an equal number of participants. Multiple teams may register for the tournament; the faculty choose two to compete in the Battle of Strixhaven. The characters' team is chosen to compete along with a team that consists of their Rivals and other NPCs.

More information about the Battle of Strixhaven and the opposing team is provided later in this adventure. The Mage Tower game isn't until the end of the academic year, but preparing for it plays a key role in this adventure.

If you wish, roleplay the scene in which the characters register their team with Professor Sharpbeak. The owlin counselor can be found in the Biblioplex near the Hall of Oracles. There, she's helping direct new first-year students to vital places on campus. For a description and map of the Biblioplex (*map 3.1*), see *chapter 3*.

If characters don't immediately leap at the chance to form a Mage Tower team for the Battle of Strixhaven, emphasize that every peer they speak with wants to see them participate. In addition to social rewards, the characters learn that participating in the Battle of Strixhaven earns them a permanent commendation on their student record, as well as a monetary prize of half of their tuition for this academic year waived. Effectively, this means each character receives 400 gp if their team wins.

## Mascots Everywhere!

When the characters register their team name with Professor Sharpbeak, the owlin counselor's eyes briefly dart about with trepidation. She asks the characters to walk with her outside the Biblioplex to discuss an important matter.

She says the following in a confiding voice:

>>"It's fortunate that you've found me now. This Mage Tower game is my event to organize, but everything is already going wrong.
>>
>>"You see, I need to tag the college mascots on campusÃ¢ÂÂthose little magical creatures that roam the grounds. We use them as mascots for our Mage Tower games. If the deans find out that some of the mascots aren't cataloged, my reputation will be ruined!
>>
>>"Before classes began, I corralled the mascots on an island in Sedgemoor. But before I finished cataloging them, a half-dozen escaped and vanished. This morning, I heard students chattering about mascots causing a commotion on the outer grounds of Wiltroot Hall."
>>

The professor rifles through her bag and pulls out a cheesecloth sack filled with small woven bands, each embroidered with a number. She continues:

>>"Each of them must be tagged with these bands. But I can't do it myself. With the start of classes, I'm buried under work.
>>
>>"I've seen how you handle yourselves, and I'm impressed with your skills. Could you head to Wiltroot Hall on Witherbloom's campus and discreetly slip these bands onto every mascot you find? I'd be grateful. What's more, I'd owe you a favor. What do you say?"
>>

Encourage the characters to take on Professor Sharpbeak's favor within the first few days of this adventure. For ease of running this adventure, it's best that the characters complete this event before the "*Practice Makes Perfect*" section. If the characters are reluctant, reinforce that the mascots are bound to disperse eventually and that fulfilling Professor Sharpbeak's request will become more difficult the longer they wait.

When the characters are ready to act on Professor Sharpbeak's request, move on to the description of Wiltroot Hall below.

### Choosing a Mage Tower Mascot

As mentioned in "*The Game of Mage Tower*," each team in a Mage Tower game chooses a mascot creature to represent them and to serve as a focal point of the game's scoring. If the characters discuss finding a mascot to represent their team, Professor Sharpbeak assures them that any mascot they find at Wiltroot Hall could serve as their team mascot. If the characters don't ask about mascots now, you can prompt them to choose a mascot later in the academic year, when the game approaches. Mascots don't confer benefits in the game, although Mage Tower participants are often sentimental about their mascots.

![Mascots are common sights on campusÃ¢ÂÂand sometimes they gather and cause mischief](img/book/SCC/070-04-003.mascots.webp)

### Wiltroot Hall

Despite its location on the outer grounds of Witherbloom College's campus, Wiltroot Hall is normally a safe locale. But the activities of **Murgaxor** and his mage hunter servitors have drawn lurking dangers from more remote parts of the bayou.

As he grows more proficient in his ability to siphon creatures' energy to power his magic, **Murgaxor** is practicing lesser forms of the magic that will eventually culminate in his destructive ritual in *chapter 6*. Evidence of his magic persists in *area W5*. The strange energy of his magic has drawn creatures to the area around Wiltroot Hall and made them unusually aggressive. Professor Sharpbeak's stray mascots have also been drawn to the area, though they are no more aggressive than usual.

#### A Standalone Adventure

If you're running this chapter as a standalone adventure, the bayou creatures' aggressive presence is a result of the mage hunters' activity in the area, not **Murgaxor**'s magic. Characters can find traces of the mage hunters' presence in area W5.

#### Mascot Hunting

Six mascots escaped Professor Sharpbeak's custody and fled to the grounds of Wiltroot Hall, drawn to the bog's latent decay.

***Finding.*** As described in the "*Wiltroot Hall Locations*" section below, the six missing mascots can be found in areas *W2*, *W3*, *W6*, *W9*, *W10*, and *W11*.

***Cataloging.*** Affixing one of Professor Sharpbeak's bands onto a mascot typically requires an action and a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, though you may allow other types of ability checks.

For example, a character who tries to trick a mascot into approaching can make a Charisma (Deception) check, or a character who uses gestures and a calm voice to convince a mascot to wear the band can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check.

The spirit statue in area W6 requires special coaxing to wear the band. See that area for more details.

***Investigating.*** Once the characters catch their third mascot, a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check reveals that a sinister magical signature is drawing the mascots hereÃ¢ÂÂthe sensation is something like a rotten-smelling tingle in the back of one's nostrils. The exact nature of the unsettling latent magic isn't clear, but it seems to fundamentally involve drawing energy from living creatures.

#### Wiltroot Hall Features

The hall and surrounding grounds have the following features (areas not numbered are easily traversable but devoid of significant features or creatures):

- **Building Ceilings.** The ceiling of Wiltroot Hall (*area W1*) is 40 feet high. The ceilings of the observation huts (areas *W2*, *W7*, *W9*, *W10*, and *W14*) are 10 feet high.
- **Building Doors.** The doors to Wiltroot Hall (area W1) and the observation huts (areas W2, W7, W9, W10, and W14) are unlocked.
- **Swampy Stinkbrush.** The areas surrounding the clearings and walkways contain a mixture of nearly impassable, awful-smelling deep bog and thick undergrowth. These areas are difficult terrain if the characters want to explore them, but it's clear that few creatures would intentionally pass through these areas.
- **Walkways.** The walkways and the platform underneath the hall are made of magically reinforced wood and enclosed by short guard rails. The walkways are two feet above the swamp. Hopping over the guard rail into the bog or clearings below, or pulling oneself up onto a walkway from the ground below, requires an action but no ability check.

### Wiltroot Hall Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.1. All descriptions assume the characters are exploring this area during the day. There are no classes taking place here when the characters arrive, so the area is sparsely populated.

![Map 4.1: Wiltroot Hall and Outer Grounds](img/book/SCC/071-map-4.1-wiltroot-hall-and-outer-grounds.webp)![Player Version](img/book/SCC/map-4.1-wiltroot-hall-and-outer-grounds-player.webp)
#### W1. Hall and Learning Platform

>>The trunk of an enormous dead tree rises nearly one hundred feet in the air. Near the ground, the wide trunk has been hollowed out and carved to form doors, windows, and a spacious learning center. Surrounding the tree is a wooden platform that overlooks the bog and walkways beyond.
>>

This area is devoid of faculty, staff, or students, leaving the building full of class supplies. Up to three *herbalism kits* or *poisoner's kits* could be crafted from these materials, as well as up to three vials of *antitoxin* and two *potions of healing*.

#### W2. Observation Hut A

>>The small hut in this clearing has a heavily thatched roof and a rickety door that swings open to reveal a sparse interior. A few wooden chairs and a heavy table with an attached cabinet make up the hut's furnishings.
>>

The clearing outside the hut is uninhabited.

***Mascot.*** Opening the table's cabinet inside the hut reveals a **pest mascot** (see *chapter 7*) gnawing on a cracked, strange-looking stone. The pest is one of the mascots the characters must catalog for Professor Sharpbeak, as mentioned in the "*Mascot Hunting*" section earlier.

***Treasure.*** The cracked stone the pest is gnawing on is an *Ioun stone (awareness)*. The stone is malfunctioning and was discarded here. A character who tinkers with the *Ioun stone* for 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check mends the item so it functions as intended.

#### W3. Southwest Clearing

>>Although the spongy ground here is covered in moss, it's easily traversable in comparison to the surrounding brush. A raised wooden walkway nearby overlooks this open area.
>>

This clearing appears to be empty. However, a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals movement in the western part of the surrounding brush. If the characters linger here for a round, they catch the attention of two **ankhegs**. The aggressive creatures attack, retreating back into the brush only if the characters reduce one or both of them to 10 hit points or fewer.

***Mascot.*** Once the ankhegs are dispatched, the characters see an **inkling mascot** (see *chapter 7*) poke its head out from the underbrush nearby. The inkling is one of the mascots the characters must catalog for Professor Sharpbeak, as mentioned in the "*Mascot Hunting*" section earlier.

#### W4. Southern Outskirts

>>This open clearing features a notable pool of black, sludgy refuse in the southern corner.
>>

If the characters approach the refuse, it reveals itself to be an aggressive **black pudding**. The black pudding has eaten the remnants of creatures slain in this region recently, so it's Huge. Its game statistics are otherwise the same. The black pudding tries to flee when reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, as do any puddings resulting from it splitting.

#### W5. Southern Clearing

>>A ring of peat, decayed leaves, and beetle-infested animal skulls sit in the middle of this open clearing. The stench of rot is strong.
>>

This clearing holds two clues to the evil activity taking place in this part of the bayou.

***Mage Hunter Chitin.*** A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a piece of chipped chitin plating. This plating sloughed off the mage hunters while they lingered here, but the characters can identify it only if they're familiar with mage hunters. If a character shows the plating to a faculty member, the faculty member says it could have come from a dangerous creature but is unsure of its origin.

***Murgaxor's Scrawls.*** A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals illegible scrawls in the dirt that match the writing in the journal the characters found in Sedgemoor last academic year.

![Some pests in Sedgemoor, eluding capture, grow to prodigious size](img/book/SCC/072-04-004.pests-in-sedgemoor.webp)

#### W6. Southeastern Clearing

>>Two lumps of slimy vegetation and moss stand prominently in the northeast corner of this clearing.
>>

If the characters approach the two lumps, a guttural gurgle emits from them in tandem. Rising to stand is a fungal, mossy beast that groans, "Disturbed! I am disturbed!" before it attacks the characters. This momentarily animated fungal mass is a Plant but otherwise uses the stat block of an **ettin**. When it's reduced to 0 hit points, the creature melts back into the spongy bog floor.

***Mascot.*** Once the fungal mass is dispatched, the characters can see a **spirit statue mascot** (see *chapter 7*) poke its head out from the underbrush nearby. The statue chuckles and says, "I'm quite bored of behaving as Professor Sharpbeak says. From now on, it's nothing but mischief! I'm a free spirit!" Convincing the statue that its work on campus is important and it should wear the band requires an action and a successful DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The statue is one of the mascots the characters must catalog for Profession Sharpbeak, as mentioned in the "*Mascot Hunting*" section earlier.

#### W7. Observation Hut B

>>A small hut, its thatched roof drooping heavily, languishes in the southern edge of this clearing. A canopy of ancient growth looms over it.
>>

If the characters approach the hut, it becomes clear that the leafy canopy is obscuring a **giant scorpion**. The aggressive creature attacks, as does the **ankheg** that steps out from the brush behind it. The creatures fight alongside each otherÃ¢ÂÂanother unusual event in this area. If the characters reduce either creature to 10 hit points or fewer, it tries to flee.

***Treasure.*** Herbalism supplies cover a heavy table inside this hutÃ¢ÂÂenough to assemble one *herbalism kit*.

#### W8. Western Clearing

>>You arrive at the clearing to find two of your classmates cautiously eying two large, yellow, viscous puddles oozing out from the underbrush near the west side of this clearing.
>>

The characters' classmates Urzmaktok Grojsh and Melwythorne (two **Witherbloom apprentices**; see *chapter 3*) came here to explore the area. Ever the overachiever, Urzmaktok is taking advantage of the empty grounds to gather plant cuttings. He hopes to study them through the Fantastical Horticulture Club and petition his Witherbloom professors for extra credit if he successfully nurtures them. Timid for a third-year student, Urzmaktok convinced the lonely Melwythorne to accompany him to the grounds, both so Melwythorne might tell stories about his grove and so Melwythorne could protect him from any dangers.

The two Witherbloom students had decided to approach the puddles when the characters discover them. When anyone steps toward the puddles, they jiggle and solidify into two **ochre jellies**. If they see the characters, the jellies climb up onto the walkway in pursuit of prey. An ochre jelly reduced to 5 hit points or fewer tries to flee.

***Witherbloom Peers.*** Once an altercation begins with the ochre jellies, Urzmaktok and Melwythorne flee to safety. After combat ends, any friendly word convinces them to help the characters track down and catalog the errant mascots. The characters have advantage on ability checks made to catalog a mascot if Urzmaktok or Melwythorne is present to lend assistance.

#### W9. Observation Hut C

>>This large and well-maintained observation hut has one level above the walkway and another below it.
>>

When the characters enter this building, they smell the pungent algae within a large fountain bubbling up from the center of the floor of the lower level. This is a naturally occurring spring. A pockmarked stone carving in the shape of a stylized, anthropomorphic wave surrounds and collects the water.

Javenesh Stoutclaw (neutral good owlin **Lorehold apprentice**; see *chapter 3*) stands next to the fountain, tilting his head in confusion and ruffling his feathers while seemingly talking to himself. If the characters approach the fountain, they see that Javenesh is speaking with a **water weird** submerged inside it. Unlike most water weirds, this creature, named Lothannep, can speak and understand Common.

Lothannep lives in the fountain when the university isn't in session. Lothannep was bound generations ago to a pool located in the wilds off Witherbloom's campus. Lothannep's mage master released it long ago, and it has been wandering about as it pleases since.

![Sedgemoor is expansive and can be intimidating even for older students who explore its grounds](img/book/SCC/073-04-005.sedgemoor.webp)

Lothannep likes this hut but will be ejected once the Witherbloom faculty discovers the weird's presence. A character can befriend Lothannep by engaging it in friendly conversation and succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check, with advantage if the character is a Witherbloom student. The water weird can be persuaded to relocate to another body of water, but only if a character toward which it is friendly suggests it.

***Lorehold Peer.*** Javenesh traipsed to this area on an errand for Tulk Tusktooth, the manager of Bow's End Tavern. Tulk asked Javenesh to collect water from this fountain for use in Chef Curtie Axechucker's special dish. Javenesh is trying and failing to explain to Lothannep why he needs the water when the characters arrive.

A character who strikes up a friendship with the **water weird** can persuade Lothannep to leave the fountain long enough for Javenesh to fill his tankard. Whether or not the characters help Javenesh with his errand, the owlin is amenable to aiding them with their mission to find the lost mascots. A character has advantage on ability checks made to catalog a mascot if Javenesh is present to lend assistance.

***Mascot.*** Once the characters have interacted with Lothannep, they see a **fractal mascot** (see *chapter 7*) emerge from under a table in the hut. The fractal is one of the mascots the characters must catalog for Professor Sharpbeak, as mentioned in the "*Mascot Hunting*" section earlier.

#### W10. Observation Hut D

>>Stained paint brushes and empty watercolor palettes are scattered on a table in this small thatched-roof hut, which has a view of large clearings to the north and south.
>>

The table in the building holds enough materials to create a set of *painter's supplies* and a set of *calligrapher's supplies*.

***Mascot.*** A mischievous **art elemental mascot** (see *chapter 7*) rests underneath the table. The art elemental is one of the mascots the characters must catalog for Professor Sharpbeak, as mentioned in the "*Mascot Hunting*" section earlier.

#### W11. Northwestern Clearing

>>Tangled vines and trees draped with thick, hanging moss flank the northern edges of this large clearing. Movement in the foliage to the north gives the area a sense of being alive.
>>

When a character ventures toward the north end of this clearing, two **giant elk** burst out of the foliage. The giant elk are angry and confused, and they attack. If an elk is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it regains its senses and tries to flee.

***Mascot.*** Once the characters deal with the elk, they see a **pest mascot** (see *chapter 7*) emerge from the underbrush near where the elk rested. The pest is one of the mascots the characters must catalog for Professor Sharpbeak, as mentioned in the "*Mascot Hunting*" section earlier.

#### W12. Northern Clearing

>>The wide wooden walkway here runs alongside a small clearing in the bog. A thick bed of mushrooms grows along the clearing's western edge.
>>

A character who moves toward the clearing's western side sees a **giant boar** munching on the mushrooms. Like the elk in area W11, the boar is angry and confused and initially attacks. If it's reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, it tries to flee into the bog.

#### W13. Northern Outskirts

>>The boggy ground here feels firmer than at many of the other clearings, and flowering plants fill the area. It's a lovely, unexpected landscape within the marsh, as the delicate floral scents mix with those of peat and earth to perfume the air.
>>

This area is devoid of any creatures.

***Treasure.*** If the characters search this area, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals an emerald-colored glint in the stamen of a large pink flower. This is an *elemental gem (emerald)*, discarded or perhaps lost. If the characters speak to Witherbloom faculty members about it, the characters learn that no one has reported the lost item, so they're permitted to keep it.

#### W14. Observation Hut E

>>A small hut with a thatched roof sits beside the wooden walkway that cuts through this large clearing. Two bulbous masses of fungus and vegetation grow in the southeast corner behind the building.
>>

If a character approaches the southeast corner behind the observation hut, two **brackish trudges** (see *chapter 7*) animate. Like the elk in *area W11* and the boar in *area W12*, the trudges are initially hostile and attack. However, if a trudge is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it regains its senses and tries to flee.

### Reporting to Prof. Sharpbeak

When the characters catalog one or more mascots for Professor Sharpbeak and want to report back to her, they find the counselor in the Biblioplex. If the characters tell her about the dangers that lurked near Wiltroot Hall, she expresses shock at the aggressive fauna and promises to have faculty members secure the area promptly.

When the characters report the number of mascots they've cataloged, read:

>>Professor Sharpbeak smiles. "You've saved me a lot of effort, students," she says. "Now I don't need to track them all down! Thank you for your assistance." She scribbles on a sheet of parchment and hands you the document.
>>

The document entitles the characters to one free uncommon magic item of their choice from the Biblioplex's student store (area *B5* of map 3.1 in *chapter 3*).

## Scrivening and Symbology Exam: Glyph of Warding

During their second year at Strixhaven, the characters are enrolled together in a course called Scrivening and Symbology, which is held in a lecture hall in the Biblioplex (one of the areas marked *B7* on *map 3.1* in *chapter 3*). The course covers the basics of recognizing, deciphering, and understanding the magic behind arcane scripts and symbols. Over the course of the term, students learn how to tell scribbles and doodles from magically imbued symbols, and they study popular accounts of adventurers who've come across magic-based writing in their travels. They also learn about common spells that incorporate writing and symbology in their casting. The course's professor is Brenneth Blackstone (chaotic good dhampir **Silverquill professor of shadow**; see *chapter 7*), a rising star in scriptology whose dynamic lectures are practically performance art.

This course's first Exam takes place a short while after the events of the "*Mascots Everywhere!*" section and tests students on their knowledge of scrivening and symbology, as expressed in *glyph of warding* spells. For more information about the rules used for Exams, see *chapter 3*.

![Scribing magic is an important field of study at Strixhaven, as sloppiness can have strange effects](img/book/SCC/074-04-006.scribing-magic.webp)

### Studying Phase

The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.

Once you've asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 15 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters' rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.

### Testing Phase

On the day of the Exam, each character makes two ability checks related to parts of the test:

- **Glyph of Warding Shapes.** Identifying the shapes commonly used when a mage casts a *glyph of warding* requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
- **Common Glyph Effects.** Writing an essay on common magical effects and triggers associated with *glyph of warding* spells requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Have each player note their character's Exam resultsÃ¢ÂÂhow many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the testÃ¢ÂÂon their copies of the tracking sheet.

## Advance to 5th Level!

Each character advances to 5th level at the end of their first Scrivening and Symbology Exam.

## Party at the Rose Stage

One evening a short while into the academic year, word begins to spread about a hubbub originating at the Rose Stage on Silverquill's campus. The characters are invited by one of their peers to the after-hours shenanigans happening right now.

Another student is part of this sceneÃ¢ÂÂideally a student the characters have interacted with, or you may choose another student from the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3*.

As twilight falls, a student rushes toward the characters. The student says through their laughter:

>>"You've got to see what's going on at the Rose Stage! Someone's cooked up a batch of mascot bait, and now the place is crawling with the little critters! They're as happy as baby boars in mud, so we're going to try a game. It's mascot stacking, and the winner gets a fancy prize!"
>>

The mascot-stacking competition takes place in area R3 of the Rose Stage; see map 3.5 in *chapter 3*.

## Stack 'Em High

When the characters arrive at the Rose Stage, read or paraphrase the following:

>>You hear the party before you see it. Laughter, whooping, and shouting waft from the stage as a chaotic scene comes into sight.
>>
>>On the main Rose Stage, a dozen students playfully dart away from several pests while other mascots watch nearby. The scurrying students hold goopy substances in their hands that look like honey mixed with mushroom pieces. Off to the side, more students stand, laughing and holding curious-looking wands.
>>

A student shouts through uncontrollable giggling:

>>"Gross! Look at those goofs, covered in pest bait! I don't know what's in it, but the pests love it. We'll give them their snacksÃ¢ÂÂwe were just waiting on you. We knew you'd want in on this mascot-stacking contest! The other mascots want to play, too!"
>>

Once the characters arrive on the scene, the students with the pest bait feed the pests. Twenty mascots occupy the stage, with each campus represented: two **art elementals** from Prismari, two **fractals** from Quandrix, two **inklings** from Silverquill, four **spirit statues** from Lorehold, and ten **pests**.

The bait the students concocted for the pests is made from sugary syrup mixed with mushrooms taken from Witherbloom's campus. The students recently discovered it's a harmless snack that keeps pests docile, allowing anyone to play with the normally flighty mascots.

The students standing beside the stage hold wands that are ordinary spellcasting focuses imbued with a limited telekinesis-like effect. When pointed at a mascot within 5 feet, a wand magically lifts the mascot, places it atop another adjacent mascot, and stabilizes the stacked mascots. The mascots might still topple over afterward, but the wands allow the students to stack the mascots without having to physically manipulate them.

In this game, the other mascots jovially participate in the stacking contest. The spirit statues offer to serve as each stack's base. The art elementals, fractals, and inklings gleefully wait to be piled on the stacks while the pests snack away, oblivious to the game.

![From a distance, pests look round, squishy, and cuddly. Up close, they're sharp](img/book/SCC/075-04-007.pests.webp)

### The Contest

Stacking mascots without the creatures toppling over is a major bragging right, and the characters have the opportunity of earning that now.

Further, Greta Gorunn (chaotic good dwarf **Lorehold apprentice**; see *chapter 3*) has offered a *belt of dwarvenkind* as the prize for this contest. Her parents sent her the belt as a gift, but she thinks it's more fun to offer the belt as a trophy.

In this contest, up to four teams of two students apiece race to create the highest stack of gathered mascots. At least one team should consist of NPC students, and you should make rolls for them. If the characters have Rivals, two of them form this opposing team. If not, choose students from the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3*.

Characters who don't wish to form a team can participate by cheering or heckling, as described below:

- **Encourage a Team.** A character can shout encouragement to a single team. If they do, one member of that team has advantage on their ability check in the stacking game.
- **Heckle a Team.** A character can jeer and rankle a single team. If they do, both members of that team have disadvantage on their ability checks in the game.

### Playing the Game

As noted above, each mascot-stacking team has two members, each of whom uses a wand. To determine which team stacks the most mascots, have each member of the team make one ability check of their choice, chosen from the following options: Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), Intelligence (Arcana), or Wisdom (Animal Handling). Record the check totals for each team member, then combine them for each team. The team with the highest combined total wins the game.

For example, if one member of a team gets a total of 16 on their Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to expertly point their wand and the other member gets a total of 20 on their Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to stack the mascots comfortably, their combined total is 36Ã¢ÂÂand they win the game if no other team has a higher total.

If there's a tie, add a tiebreaker round or use your discretion to determine the winner.

### Relationship Encounter

During this game, characters might mingle with the other students. If there are students the characters wish to earn Relationship Points with, treat this as a Relationship encounter, as described in the rules found in the "Relationships" section in *chapter 3*. Have players note the results of this encounter on their tracking sheets.

## It's Got Three Heads!

As the winning team is declared, the pests in the mascot stacks suddenly transform into a hostile creature. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>The cheering from the students on the Rose Stage suddenly turns to panicked shouts. The normal croaking, chirruping, and screeching of pests turns into guttural groans. The pests amalgamate, their bodies fusing into a multiheaded whole, while the other mascots scatter. The fused creature roars, spewing spittle from one of its heads. Everyone on stage is in danger!
>>

The amalgamated pests move as a single creature in *area R3* of the Rose Stage. The creature threatens an opposing team of mascot-stackers, and it uses the stat block of a **chimera**, though it doesn't have a breath weapon. Because it's evening, the lighting in all areas of the Rose Stage is dim. The gathered students and other mascots flee or hide, and it's up to the characters to face this threat.

Once the characters reduce the amalgamated creature to 0 hit points, it collapses into its component pests, which look at the characters and blink in confusion. The pests appear unharmed by the event.

### Examining the Pests

Pests don't normally amalgamate and turn hostile, then transform back into harmless pests. If the characters examine the pests after the amalgamation is defeated, a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals little pools of regurgitated bait on the floor near the pests. Mixed in the pools are small, sharp pieces of same chitin found in *area W5* near Wiltroot Hall. The pests ingested this chitin, leading to their strange transformation.

### Practice Time

Once the characters resolve the altercation with the amalgamated mascots, the party on the Rose Stage resumes. Before the characters leave the area, Rosie Wuzfeddlims (chaotic good gnome **Lorehold apprentice**; see *chapter 7*) approaches them. The gnome announces that Aerojaunt Field is reserved for the characters' Mage Tower team to practice.

The characters' designated practice slot is at the end of this week. As a student referee, Rosie is tasked with helping the characters learn the rules of Mage Tower and the game's basic techniques. Further, as long as the entire party has not made a Rival of Rosie, she promises to gift their team a *stone of good luck* after they practice that can be used at the game later in the year.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Mage Tower practice takes place at Aerojaunt Field. This practice field is on the central campus, and it's available for anyone to use.

When the characters are ready to begin practice, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Before you is a carefully maintained dirt field. In the center, an elongated hexagon etched in glowing, magical chalk outlines a series of ramps built into the dirt.
>>
>>Dugouts face each other on opposite sides of the field. North of the dugouts are bleachers, and south of the dugouts are some outbuildings. Right now, the most prominent feature is a gnome dressed in black-and-white striped shorts and a matching tunic. A knapsack hangs at her side, and a large whistle dangles from her neck. Rosie Wuzfeddlims, one of Strixhaven's student referees, is ready for some serious game time.
>>
>>"Friends!" she shouts. "Stupendous timing! Oh, this is going to be great!"
>>

During this event, the characters split into two teams and practice moving dummy mascots from one side of the field to another. If there are an uneven number of characters, Rosie joins a team to even the competition.

### Aerojaunt Field

Aerojaunt Field was once the university's primary sports field. Now, years after the construction of Strixhaven Stadium, the field sees far less use. Its official purpose is as a dedicated practice field for Strixhaven's high-profile student teams, whose official matches take place in newer facilities elsewhere on campus.

However, less competitive teams hold their matches on this field, most notably the Intramural Silkball Club. The elevated ramps used in silkball matches were permanently built into Aerojaunt Field, whose name evokes a popular silkball move that involves using magic to hop through the air.

### Aerojaunt Field Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map 4.2. Descriptions assume the characters are using this field during the day. At night, the field is devoid of students.

![Map 4.2: Aerojaunt Field](img/book/SCC/076-map-4.2-aerojaunt-field.webp)![Player Version](img/book/SCC/map-4.2-aerojaunt-field-player.webp)
#### A1. Southwestern Outbuilding

>>This gray metal storage shed consists of three short silos topped with flat roofs. Weathered wooden doors that were once painted bright yellow lead inside, and a short fence protects the building from impacts from gear sent flying from the field.
>>

The doors to these sheds are locked, but Rosie has the key, as do several faculty members. A character using thieves' tools can open either lock with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check.

This shed's central silo contains a jumble of obsolete equipment that belongs to the gymnastics club. Old practice horses, balance beams, disassembled high bars, floor mats, and more are shoved against the curved wall.

***Treasure.*** In the main silo's northeast corner are two unlocked chests. Both contain stacks of outdated gymnastics uniforms. However, a *cloak of displacement* lies forgotten at the bottom of one chest. If the characters try to find the cloak's owner, Rosie or any faculty member learns the cloak is unclaimed, so the characters are welcome to keep it.

#### A2. Southeastern Outbuilding

The doors to these sheds are locked, but Rosie has a key. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens each lock.

This shed's central silo holds old silkball and Mage Tower equipment: bins of deflated silkballs, wooden dummy mascots, and dented field rakes.

***Treasure.*** In the main silo's northwest corner are two unlocked chests that both contain stacks of outdated silkball uniforms. However, a *cloak of elvenkind* lies forgotten at the bottom of one chest. If the characters try to find the cloak's owner, Rosie or any faculty member learns the cloak is unclaimed, so the characters are welcome to keep it.

#### A3. Practice Field

>>The hexagonal shape of this old practice field is outlined in glowing magical chalk. Several dirt ramps, each at least ten feet wide, slope and crisscross dizzyingly.
>>

The straight central lengths of each ramp are elevated to the heights indicated on map 4.2.

![Practice for the Battle of Strixhaven leads to the year-end event that takes place in Strixhaven Stadium](img/book/SCC/077-04-008.battle-of-strixhaven.webp)

#### A4. Dugout

In each dugout, a small vial was accidentally left behind. In the west dugout, the vial contains *oil of slipperiness*. In the east dugout, it's a *potion of climbing*. A character who searches a dugout finds the relevant vial tucked underneath a back bench.

#### A5. Bleachers

These bleachers rise 30 feet in the air at the back.

### Mage Tower Practice

After the characters arrive at the field, Rosie explains that the Mage Tower game the characters are practicing for will take place in nearby Strixhaven Stadium. The stadium doesn't have ramps built into the field. "But practicing with them is fun!" she explains. "Plus, you'll get better at the game! What's not to love?"

#### During Practice

When the characters are ready to start practice, Rosie retrieves two bright blue wooden dummy mascots from *area A2*. She explains that the characters need to split into two teams for the purposes of scrimmaging; if there is an odd number of characters, Rosie joins in as a participant.

Once the teams are determined, Rosie assigns each team one of the blue dummy mascots. She then jogs out onto the field (*area A3*) and places one dummy mascot at the north end of the field and another at the south end. Then she escorts the characters to the center of the ramp elevated to 20 feet (see *map 4.2*). She explains that the scrimmage will take place over three phases that each last twenty minutes; when she gives the signal, the teams should dash toward the opposing team's mascot, grab it, and try to bring it back to their own team's end of the field to score a point. Participants can use magic or physical means to steal their opponents' mascot and defend their own, but they can't damage any participants, the mascots, the audience, or the facility.

***Making Ability Checks.*** Feel free to narrate or roleplay this encounter however your players find enjoyable. Ultimately, each character makes a single Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), or Intelligence (Arcana) check, as chosen by the player.

***Using Magic.*** Instead of making an ability check, a character can cast a spell. The level of the spell determines the benefit:

- **1st or 2nd Level.** A character can cast a 1st- or 2nd-level spell to grant another character advantage on their ability check.
- **3rd Level or Higher.** If a character casts a spell of 3rd level or higher, it counts as a successful ability check for the purpose of determining the winner.

Ask the player to describe which spell the character casts and how it helps their team during play. For example, a player might say, "My character uses a *grease* spell to make one of the ramps slippery, causing the other team to slip and fall."

***Determining the Winner.*** The team with the greatest number of successful ability checks wins the scrimmage (ties are possible).

#### After Practice

Regardless which team wins, Rosie slaps her thigh with glee, declaring that she hasn't had so much fun in ages. She reaches into one of her knapsacks and pulls out a smooth, glowing stone. She says:

>>"As promised, here's a giftÃ¢ÂÂthink of it as a good luck charm for the upcoming game!"
>>

The stone is a *stone of good luck*, and the characters are welcome to keep it indefinitely.

### An Unwelcome Visitor

At the end of practice, after Rosie gives the characters her gift, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Without warning, the joyous look on Rosie's face changes into terror. Flinging an arm toward the field's eastern dugout, she stammers wildly.
>>
>>"Wh- wh- *monster*!" she shouts, then runs for cover.
>>

Emerging from the eastern dugout is a hulking **blue slaad**. The enraged creature fights to the death.

Any character who aced their *Magical Physiologies Exam* about slaadi (see "Campus Kerfuffle" in *chapter 3*) receives advantage on attack rolls made against the slaad during this encounter.

#### Examining the Slaad

If the characters examine the slaad's body, they see superficial claw wounds all over its skin. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine or Perception) check reveals the presence of chipped chitin embedded in these wounds. Characters who notice this chitin can tell that it's the same sort found in *area W5* of Wiltroot Hall and on the *Rose Stage*.

After examining the chitin, a character can make a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check. If the check succeeds, the character logically concludes that one or more chitinous creatures goaded the slaad into attacking. The characters don't yet know the mage hunters' identity or full plans, but they'll soon have a better idea once they realize the sort of creatures hunting them.

## Scrivening and Symbology Exam: Symbol Glyphs

The characters' second Exam in Scrivening and Symbology takes place a short while after their practice scrimmage at Aerojaunt Field. Students are tested on their knowledge of scrivening and symbology as expressed in the *symbol* spell.

The multiple choice portion of the Exam focuses on identifying common surfaces used for inscribing *symbol* glyphs. The essay portion then requires students to reason out how best to avoid the effects of a *symbol* spell.

### Studying Phase

The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.

Once you've asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 16 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters' rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.

### Testing Phase

On the day of the Exam, each character makes two ability checks related to parts of the test:

- **Symbol Surfaces.** Identifying the most suitable surfaces to scribe a *symbol* on requires a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
- **Avoiding Symbol Effects.** Writing up the details of common methods to avoid triggering symbols, plus physical and mental techniques for resisting their effects once they have been triggered, requires a successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

Have each player note their character's Exam resultsÃ¢ÂÂhow many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the testÃ¢ÂÂon their copies of the tracking sheet.

### To the Scriptoria Collections

Professor Brenneth Blackstone approaches the characters after he's done proctoring their Exam. Once the other students depart, the professor addresses the characters:

>>"Well, students, you've impressed meÃ¢ÂÂor else I wouldn't be asking you this favor.
>>
>>"I've been guest lecturing in Kollema Hall on Lorehold's campus this term. The administrators love my popular series on scriptology in archaeomancy, but it's eating into my prep time for my classes.
>>
>>"I need you to track down a tome in the Biblioplex's Scriptoria Collections. It's an ancient treatise on interpreting auguries called *Weale or Woe: An Interpretive Sketch* by Director Arick Quenthorne. Trouble is, no one knows where the book is hiding, and I can't prepare your upcoming Exam without it.
>>
>>"Find it and bring it to me, and extra credit for the rest of the term is yours!"
>>

Once the characters talk with Blackstone, they're free to go to the Scriptoria Collections. However, Blackstone doesn't need the book for a couple more weeks, so there's no rush to head to the collections.

*Map 4.3* shows the Scriptoria Collections. For more about what the characters discover there, see the "*Dangerous Knowledge*" section.

## Getting Some Air

Some time after their second Exam, the characters notice a commotion near Bow's End Tavern in the late afternoon.

Another student is part of this scene, in which the characters are invited to participate in a magical skating contest. Ideally, it's a student the characters have interacted with, or you may choose another student from the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3*.

The characters notice that the front of Bow's End Tavern is oddly deserted, but then they see a familiar face. The student says:

>>"Hey, friends! Tulk's drained the retention pool behind the tavern for cleaning tomorrow. For a few hours, we've got a perfectly smooth, empty pool. You know what that meansÃ¢ÂÂmage's skate park, baby! Come on, let's see who'll pull the wildest moves and win the prize purse!"
>>

### Magical Skate-Off

If the characters follow the student who invited them, that student leads them behind Bow's End Tavern. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>Behind the tavern, several groups of students cluster around an empty pool, laughing and waving improvised skates made from wooden planks with wheels affixed to the bottom. The empty pool is made of smooth stone and set about thirty feet into the ground. The tavern's back door is propped open.
>>

One of the characters' peers approaches holding a wand and two skates, thrusting both forward with a grin. They say:

>>"We were hoping you'd turn up! See these skates? On their own, pretty difficult to use, right? But check out this training wand from spellcasting class. Someone figured out that a skater can use the wand to help pull off the sweetest tricks. What better way to try it out than a contest?
>>
>>"There are bets going around, and the crowd is sure to take your side! Want to pull off some wild moves?"
>>

The wand the student is wielding is one of several scattered throughout the crowd. These wands are ordinary spellcasting foci imbued with minor magical effects. Strixhaven's instructors use them to help students practice their wand-wielding skills. These wands can create minor effects such as little puffs of smoke or crackles of energy, but clever spellcasters can use the wands while skating to perform minor jumps and acrobatic tricks on skates.

![Magical shenanigans are common on campus. Students especially love magically getting some air](img/book/SCC/078-04-009.shenanigans.webp)

#### The Skate-Off

The prize for winning the skate-off is a purse of 250 gp. There are enough skates and wands for all participants. Each character who wants to participate must strap on the rudimentary skates that their peers cobbled together. At least one participant in the skate-off is a student NPC, and you should roll their checks. The participants then skate up and down the sides of the emptied pool, using a combination of skill and momentum to perform jumps and tricks. The wand can compensate for a participant's lack of skill.

Each participant in the skate-off makes a single ability check, choosing one of the following: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), or Intelligence (Arcana). Whoever has the highest total wins. If there's a tie, the purse is split between the winners.

Characters who don't participate in the skate-off can encourage or heckle skaters as follows:

- **Encourage a Skater.** A character can shout encouragement at another student who's skating. The student then has advantage on their ability check.
- **Heckle a Skater.** A character can jeer at an opposing skater. The heckled participant has disadvantage on their ability check.

#### Relationship Encounter

During the skate-off, characters might mingle with the other students. If there are students the characters wish to earn Relationship Points with, treat this as a Relationship encounter, as described in the rules found in the "Relationships" section in *chapter 3*. Have players note the results of this encounter on their tracking sheets.

### That's Not Supposed to Happen!

At the end of the skate-off, after the purse is given to the winner or distributed among multiple winners, one of the wands used during the skate-off accidentally summons a monster. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>The crowd roars as the winner is announced. A student waves their wand in celebration, and shockingly, a thunderous clap echoes from it.
>>
>>Your fellow students quiet in confusion. Suddenly, a creature erupts from the ground, causing nearby students to scream and scatter.
>>
>>"That rock thing!" the student shouts. "It's heading into the tavern!"
>>

The wand has summoned an angry and confused **galeb duhr**.

At the start of combat, the characters are outside the tavern's back exit (the western portion of *area E5* on *map 3.3* in *chapter 3*). Suddenly, a creature erupts from the ground, causing nearby students to scream and scatter. The galeb duhr fights the characters until reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, when it tries to flee.

#### Examining the Scene

Examining the wand the student used to accidentally summon the galeb duhr reveals that it's different in weight and texture than the other wands.

A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the wand is a summoning device, albeit a strange one intended to work only once. Further, a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals slimy remnants stuck into the wand's grooves, while a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that the slimy substance is algae from Witherbloom's campus.

## Dangerous Knowledge

When the characters are ready to search for the tome Professor Blackstone needsÃ¢ÂÂor if they're eager to investigate the strange occurrences they've experienced recentlyÃ¢ÂÂthey can head to the Scriptoria Collections.

The Scriptoria Collections lie below the main level of the Biblioplex. The reference librarian (*area B4* on *map 3.1* in *chapter 3*) can point them in the right direction, as can a faculty member or student.

Characters can ask anyone in the Biblioplex, including the librarians, about the title Professor Blackstone mentionedÃ¢ÂÂ*Weale or Woe: An Interpretive Sketch*. The librarians confirm that the book is located in the Scriptoria Collections, but they're unsure exactly how it was cataloged, so the characters need to track it down. If the characters ask the librarians or anyone else about strange chitinous creatures (if you're running this as a standalone) or the magical signature they've found all over campus (if you're running this as a campaign), no one knows anything about either subject.

![Precision is key. Saying "books on mage hunters" isn't the same as saying "books about mage hunters"](img/book/SCC/079-04-010.precision.webp)

## Scriptoria Collections

When the characters head down the stairs to the Scriptoria Collections, read or paraphrase the following:

>>As you make your way down the winding staircase, the passage's gloom gives way to a warm light. The room before you is spacious and comfortable, with gleaming bookcases, wide tables, luxurious chairs, an inviting lounge, and a hearth. Oil paintings of breathtaking landscapes and heroic spellcasters line the walls, and antique spherical astrolabes are proudly displayed along the northern wall.
>>

This spacious room below the main floor of the Biblioplex was built two centuries ago, long after the construction of the main library. The great elven scholar and Strixhaven alumnus Arick Quenthorne donated the collection's initial materials. He went on to become a powerful director at Strixhaven.

Director Quenthorne was a leading occult scholar who specialized in studying the esoteric power inherent in physical objects, especially written words and symbols. Later in his career, Quenthorne shifted his interest to the evolution of magical creatures, especially those associated with spellcasters, so the records contain a dazzling assortment of information.

### Scriptoria Collections Features

The room has the following features:

![Map 4.3: Scriptoria Collections](img/book/SCC/080-map-4.3-scriptoria-collections.webp)

- **Astrolabes.** These spherical copper devices were a gift to Director Quenthorne from a society of diviners. Most are situated along the northern wall in the middle and to the west, near the hearth. Magically enchanted to help the director see into other worlds and beyond, the centermost astrolabe has been corrupted as described in the "*Is That Astrolabe Breathing?*" section. If any character examines this central astrolabe for 1 round or more, skip directly to that section.
- **Bookshelves.** The sturdy bookshelves here are bolted in place. Climbing a bookshelf requires a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.
- **Ceiling.** The ceiling is 30 feet high.
- **Door.** Only one door leads in and out of the collections. It's unlocked during the day while the Biblioplex is open. At night, the door is closed, locked, and further sealed with an *arcane lock* spell. A character using thieves' tools can open the door with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check (DC 35 while the *arcane lock* spell is in effect).
- **Hearth.** The hearth in the northwest corner of the room is decorated with antique diviner's tools. Two comfortable chairs flank it in front of a smaller spherical astrolabe to the east and a table to the south that is covered in knickknacks and artifacts from Strixhaven's earlier days.
- **Lounge.** The lounge to the northwest includes several plush sofas and comfortable chairs, along with a heavy table covered in tomes and sheets of parchment left by a previous study group. The sharp letter openers on the table can be used as silvered daggers in a fight.
- **Tables and Chairs.** The room's chairs can be moved, but its sturdy tables are bolted to the floor.

### Seeking the Professor's Tome

To find *Weale or Woe: An Interpretive Sketch* for Professor Blackstone or any other text in the room, the characters must take time to search the bookshelves. A character who searches the bookshelves for 1 hour can, at the end of that time, make a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check, finding whatever book they seek on a success.

#### Mage Hunters

Among the other books in the collection is a tome about magical creatures, penned by Arick Quenthorne himself. Any character who spends at least 10 minutes studying this tome learns that during his time as an administrator, Director Quenthorne discovered creatures lurking off campus called mage hunters. The tome provides sketches of chitinous plates matching those the characters found.

The tome states that pairs of mage hunters break with their allies to hunt specific individuals who catch their attention. With this information, the characters should realize that a pair of **mage hunters** is after them.

#### Quenthorne's History

A character who spends at least 10 minutes studying either of Director Quenthorne's tomes discovers information that sheds some light on the current situation. Director Quenthorne wrote about a student who practiced bizarre magic while attending Strixhaven during Quenthorne's tenure as an administrator 200 years ago. This student used magic to siphon energy and life from creatures. The tome describes the strange magic's lingering aura, which is identical to the magic the characters have observed. This student was censured repeatedly for breaking the university's bylaws and was expelled. The tome states that the student left and never returned to campus. The name of the student is blacked out or illegible in all mentions. Attempts at restoring the name (magical or otherwise) are ineffective.

### Is That Astrolabe Breathing?

After the characters find the tome for Professor Blackstone and gather any information they wish, or if they closely examine the central astrolabe, the astrolabe reveals itself to be a monster.

The mage hunters stalking the characters stumbled across this creature on the outskirts of campus. After imbibing *potions of invisibility* and feeding one to the creature to sneak it into the Scriptoria Collections, they told it to ambush the characters.

Read or paraphrase the following:

>>A groan echoes throughout the quiet room, like metal grinding upon metal. You spot movement from the largest astrolabe along the north wall, as the device's overlapping copper rings become lashing, barbed tentacles!
>>

The astrolabe uses the stat block of a **grick alpha**, except it doesn't have a beak attack. The creature was waiting for an opportune time to attack the characters as instructed. The creature fights until reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, when it tries to lumber up the stairs and run away.

#### Examining the Scene

Once the creature is dealt with, the characters can examine it for more information. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check reveals the presence of chipped chitin embedded in claw wounds on the creature. Characters who notice this realize it's the same material they found near Wiltroot Hall and on the Rose Stage. They can also conclude that the mage hunters subdued this creature before forcing it to ambush the characters.

### Delivering the Professor's Tome

So long as the characters deliver *Weale or Woe: An Interpretive Sketch* to Professor Blackstone before the third Exam, he lights up with relief. "Oh, the time you've saved me!" Professor Blackstone exclaims. "Thank you, students. I won't forget thisÃ¢ÂÂas promised, extra credit on the next exam is yours!"

## Scrivening and Symbology Exam: Augury

The characters' third Exam in Scrivening and Symbology takes place a couple of weeks after the incidents in the Scriptoria Collections. It tests students on their knowledge of divining strategies and techniques tied to the *augury* spell, as well as methods of interpreting the spell's opaque results.

### Studying Phase

The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.

Once you've asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 17 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters' rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.

### Testing Phase

On the day of the Exam, each character makes two ability checks related to parts of the test:

- **Augury Tools and Methods.** Choosing the most effective tools and methods for casting *augury* requires a successful DC 17 Intelligence (History) check.
- **Interpreting Weals and Woes.** Reasoning out meaningful interpretations of cryptic scenarios paired with the results of auguries requires a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Have each player note their character's Exam resultsÃ¢ÂÂhow many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the testÃ¢ÂÂon their copies of the tracking sheet.

If the characters gave *Weale or Woe: An Interpretive Sketch* to Professor Blackstone before the Exam, their Exam results are adjusted as follows:

- If they failed the Exam, they pass instead.
- If they passed the Exam, they ace it instead.
- If they aced the Exam, they receive three Student Dice, instead of two.

## Tell Us In Song!

The next time the characters are in the Biblioplex, they're challenged to a sing-off. Another student is part of this sceneÃ¢ÂÂideally a student the characters have interacted with, or you may choose another student from the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3*. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>You hear enthusiastic chanting and clapping. In the library's main area, students ring the eastern group of tables. Standing on them are familiar faces, who look like they're about to burst into song.
>>

One of the characters' peers rushes from the study area and calls out to the characters:

>>"That's the other Mage Tower team! They're trying to steal your fans!"
>>

The opposing Mage Tower team challenges the characters to a singing contest to win over the student body. This event takes place in the easternmost portion of *area B8* (see *map 3.1* in *chapter 3*). Though rowdiness isn't allowed in the library, the librarians are fascinated by the challenge and want to see how the characters handle this situation.

![Some students live for performing and burst into song](img/book/SCC/081-04-011.song.webp)

### The Opposing Team

The opposing team has as many members are there are player characters. If the characters have Rivals, those students are members of the opposing team. Choose the rest of the opposing team's members from the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3* or create new students of your own to round out the team.

### It's a Sing-off!

When the characters approach the study area where the opposing Mage Tower team waits, a student from the opposing team claps sardonically and challenges them.

>>"Oh, look, everyoneÃ¢ÂÂif it isn't the big kids on campus. They think they're going to wipe the floor with us at the Battle of Strixhaven, don't they? Well, we've got something to say about that!
>>
>>"We challenge you to a sing-off! We'll crush you in song before we crush you on the field!"
>>

If the characters participate in the sing-off, they'll gain an edge during the Battle of Strixhaven; see the "Determining the Winner" section below.

#### The Sing-Off

The sing-off takes place in two phases.

***Phase 1.*** During the first phase, the opposing team creates a group performance centered around a song. Depending on the students involved, at least one NPC sings while the others beatbox, hum harmonies, drum on tables, clap books together, tumble or dance, or perform other accompaniment. The audience is wowed at their smack-talking!

***Phase 2.*** During the second phase, the characters are in the spotlight, and they need to create a killer performance to win back the crowd. At least one character must sing, rap, chant, or otherwise vocalize lyrics. Doing so in a crowd-pleasing way requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check.

The other characters can assist the performance. They can use any skill so long as it makes sense in the context of the sing-off. A character might bench press a huge stack of books to the song's beat while lying on a table, making a Strength (Athletics) check. Or a character might leap about gymnastically in time to the song, making a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

#### Determining the Winner

If at least two characters' ability checks during the competition succeed, the characters win this sing-off and humble their opponents. If the characters win, they each gain advantage on one ability check of their choice made during the Mage Tower game at the upcoming Battle of Strixhaven.

#### The Crowd Scatters

Once this event is resolved, the reference librarians shoo the students away, reminding them of the standing edict to avoid tomfoolery in the Biblioplex.

#### Relationship Encounter

During the sing-off, characters might mingle with the other students. If there are students the characters wish to earn Relationship Points with, treat this as a Relationship encounter, as described in the rules found in the "Relationships" section in *chapter 3*. Have players note the results of this encounter on their tracking sheets.

## Battle of Strixhaven

Before the day of the Battle of Strixhaven dawns, allow the players plenty of time to tie up any loose ends their characters currently have on campus. If they haven't chosen a mascot to play the Mage Tower game with, prompt them to do so now. They need to choose whether they're playing the game with an **art elemental** from Prismari, a **fractal** from Quandrix, an **inkling** from Silverquill, a **pest** from Witherbloom, or a **spirit statue** from Lorehold. The characters need to bring the mascot with them when they report to Strixhaven Stadium for the game.

This event is the climax of this adventure. Once you're ready to begin, read the following:

>>The last day of the term has finally arrived, and it's time for you to crush your opponents at Mage Tower or face ignominious defeat. You've prepared all year for thisÃ¢ÂÂthe Battle of Strixhaven is upon you!
>>
>>Gathering your gear, you hustle toward Strixhaven Stadium. Time to show everyone what you're made of!
>>

When the characters are ready, usher them into their locker room with their chosen mascot to prepare for the game.

Regardless of the results, the characters are expected to play the game and then return to the locker room afterward to await a visit from Professor Sharpbeak, who's officiating. Remind them that Professor Sharpbeak promised to grant each of the winners half of their tuition for this term. Effectively, the characters will receive 400 gp apiece if they win the game. Even if they don't win, they're expected to return to the locker room in a show of good sportsmanship.

### Strixhaven Stadium Locations

Built less than a century ago, Strixhaven Stadium is a monument to the status and legacy of the university. Important games of Mage Tower are played here, including the famous Battle of Strixhaven. The battle takes place only every three years, so the characters can experience it only once.

The following locations are keyed to map 4.4.

![Map 4.4: Strixhaven Stadium](img/book/SCC/082-map-4.4-strixhaven-stadium.webp)![Player Version](img/book/SCC/map-4.4-strixhaven-stadium-player.webp)
#### X1. Strixhaven Field

>>Strixhaven Stadium is enormous. The circular, bright-green field is covered with small hills, and forty-foot towers rise up at either end of the field. The surrounding bleachers stretch fifty feet into the air. Five spires each fly the flag of a Strixhaven colleges, and a sixth flies a banner displaying the Strixhaven star.
>>

The entire field is *difficult terrain* owing to the hills built into the playing field. (This encourages flying and other magical means of transportation as the teams each try to ferry their opponents' mascot back to their own end of the field.) The bleachers are filled with hundreds of students and teachers.

#### X2. Locker Room

When the characters arrive for the Battle of Strixhaven, they must head to their locker room to dress and wait for the game to begin.

There are two stadium locker rooms: one at the north end of the field and another at the south end. The characters are assigned to the southernmost locker room, while their opponents are assigned the northernmost one. Lockers line each room, as do racks of uniforms and field equipment.

### Before the Battle

Before the game, both teams and their mascots are expected to stay in their respective locker rooms. They must wait until they're called onto the field before they can level sarcastic comments at members of the opposing team. Feel free to roleplay this situation as appropriate. However, if the mood turns hostile, interrupt it with the start of the game.

### The Battle Begins

When it's time for the game to begin, the magically enhanced voice of Professor Sharpbeak overwhelms all conversation, even flooding into the locker rooms.

>>"Students and teachers. Staff and friends. Welcome to the Battle of Strixhaven! Today, two teams of Strixhaven's finest will battle for the right to call themselves champions. They've practiced and you've waitedÃ¢ÂÂnow, let the game begin!"
>>

Once the announcement ends, the teams are required to move from the locker rooms onto the main field. When both teams meet Professor Sharpbeak at the center of the field, Professor Sharpbeak snags the characters' mascot, flies it to the southern end of the field, and places it there. She then flies the opposing team's mascot to the field's north end.

Returning to the center of the field, she reminds the teams that magic is allowed, but harming other participants, the mascots, the audience, and the facility is not. After a breathless pause, she then blows her whistle. The game is on!

### Resolving the Battle

The game takes place over three phases. In each phase, you should make ability checks for the student NPCs on the opposing team.

![The Battle of Strixhaven is among the most storied events on campus. Games are often talked about for years after they're played](img/book/SCC/083-04-012.battle-of-strixhaven.webp)

#### Phase 1

Each participant must make a DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to dash past opposing team members and grab their mascot, and a DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check to anticipate the opposing team's tactical ploys.

#### Phase 2

Each participant must make a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to not be faked out by the opposing team's spells or mock spells, and a DC 16 Charisma (Deception) check to fake out their opponents with spells or mock spells of their own.

#### Phase 3

Each participant must make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check to catch a stealthy opponent trying to sneak off with their mascot, and a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check to wrest their mascot away from the opponents.

#### Using Magic

Instead of making an ability check, a character can cast a spell. The level of the spell determines the benefit:

- **1st or 2nd Level.** Casting a 1st- or 2nd-level spell gives another team member of the character's choice advantage on their next ability check made during the game.
- **3rd Level or Higher.** Casting a spell of 3rd level or higher counts as a successful ability check for the purpose of determining the winning team.

#### Deciding the Winner

The team with the highest total of successful ability checks wins the Battle of Strixhaven.

### Returning to the Locker Room

When the characters return to their locker room, allow some roleplaying banter to take place.

Without warning, two **mage hunters** (see *chapter 7*) emerge from hiding places in the locker room and attack. The mage hunters entered the locker room unnoticed during the Mage Tower game and have been lying in wait for the characters to return.

Professor Sharpbeak is nowhere in sight, and it's up to the characters to save themselves. The mage hunters fight to the death.

Stuck in technical conversations on the field, Professor Sharpbeak doesn't return until the altercation with the mage hunters is over.

#### Examining the Mage Hunters

Examining the mage hunters reveals that these are the creatures that have been stalking the characters throughout this academic year. Their chitin matches the type the characters found near Wiltroot Hall, the Rose Stage, Aerojaunt Field, and the Scriptoria Collections. Characters who read the tome in the Scriptoria Collections, which mentioned that mage hunters work in pairs, should feel reassured that the threat has ended on Strixhaven's campus.

### End of the Year

Once word gets out about what happened in the locker room, the characters are celebrated as heroes on campus. Feel free to add roleplaying scenes that reinforce how the characters' actions kept calamity away from Strixhaven.

If you're running this adventure as part of a Strixhaven campaign, the characters move toward their third year at Strixhaven as admired students on campus. They haven't yet learned **Murgaxor**'s identity or what his ultimate plan is, but that information will surface soon enough. For now, the students can bask in their achievements, even as they look toward adventures to come.

## Advance to 6th Level!

Each character advances to 6th level at the end of this adventure.
